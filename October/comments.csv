NBE07512,"Remember you can leave your ""thoughts"" here about this news story, or react to other people's opinions. Personally, I am worried that because the rocket launch was a failure, North Korea will restart testing nuclear weapons next."
NBE00001,"I felt relieved to hear the news that the rocket launch failed, but now I am worried, too. I can't speculate what North Korea plot to do next."
NBE00002,"Fortunately, this time, North Korea's long launch rocket failed . But, it may success next time. It is too late that. Then, people who live around North Korea confront more fear than now. I argue that Japanese government should emphasize that North Korea must not test rocket launch and nuclear weapon again. If not , in near the future, North Korea's rocket or nuclear weapon took a heavy toll of human lives."
NBE00003,"I think Japan should continue to impose economic sanctions on North Korea whether or not its missile test failed. Anyway, North Korea's missile test and nuclear testing can be great threat to the countries around it, including Japan. We have to criticize North Korea for its provocative acts and send the messages to it through economic sanctions."
NBE00004,"I became worried when I first heard this news. The rocket launch failed, but that time Japanese government's response was not sufficient. I think that the Japanese government must prepare more in case rocket launch is successful."
NBE00005,"I am worried whether scientists concerned with this failure will be killed. As soon as Kim Jong-Un get this state, he purged a high officer who had made a mistake. Therefore I think that he may purge the scientists too. ID12040"
NBE00006,"I felt worried and fear about this news. As my classmates said, Japanese government should keep more strict watch on North Korea's words and actions especially concerning nuclear. Because as we know, nuclear power can destroy everything. Also I claim Japanese people need to have a sense of crisis."
NBE00007,"The purpose of North Korea's rocket launch was to inspire the nation, but as a result, the failure emphasized lack of consideration and it made the nation disappointed. I'm afraid that the irritation caused by this failure will give rise to North Korea's more drastic actions."
NBE00008,"When I knew this news, I felt relieved. However, at the same time, I felt fear. It is because I thought North Korea would test again. Japan is near North Korea. So Japan should be more careful than now, and it is important for Japan to cooperate with other countries. I hope peace will be brought on earth soon."
NBE00009,"This news made me sad. I agreed with ID12044 about Japanese government. They have a role of protecting Japanese. However, their react after failing of missile was terrible. They should learn how to protect our own country and people as a neighbor of North Korea. I thought this incident became a good opportunity of thinking about system of Japanese government."
NBE00010,"When I heard about the news, I was worried could Japan actually shoot down the rocket. This time, Japan took nearly 1 hour to confirm that North Korea had launched the rocket. I think Japan need extra strategy to protect Japan."
NBE00011,"Just like everyone else i felt relieved too, and also anxious about what will North Korea do next. and also same as ID12044 and ID12033, that i think we need to take another look at how Japanese government will correspond to the emergency."
NBE00012,"I'm disagree about ID12011's opinion because I think civilization society must think about North Korean's human rights. In my opinion, China must cooperate with United Nations Security Council's resolution because when it comes to North Korea problem, United Nations Security Council's resolution always rejected because of China."
NBE00013,I felt relieved when I heard the news. It is not first time to hear the news about North Korea's rocket. I am worried that they will do something dangerous again. I think Japan should watch for them more carefully.
NBE00014,"I feel less safe after the rocket failed. North Korea will find out why the rocket failed and they will learn to launch a rocket successfully . Next time, they might do better so I don't feel safe."
NBE00015,"North Korea I was reaffirmed that it is a very dangerous country by this time of missile launch. I do not know whether the missile is fired, I think, need to be more cautious because they may be fired missile to Japan time."
NBE00016,"I am relieved that there was no damage and victim. However, I think that North Korea fires the rocket again. Other countries should pay attention to North Korea more."
NBE00017,"When I heard the news for the first time, I didn't worry about it and I thought that everyone too made a fuss about it. However I heard that rocket debris crashed off Kunsan, I felt fear suddenly. I reconfirm North Korea is very dangerous, so the nation of North Korea had better purge Kim family its government. the nation of North Korea had better purge Kim family FROM its government"
NBE00018,the nation of North Korea had better purge Kim family FROM its government
NBE00019,"North Korea is wasting its money. They should use the money for food to save its citizens, not for launching missiles. It is very dangerous that North Korea is still considering to continue on inventing weapons. Countries like America, Korea and Japan should keep on putting on pressure to North Korea, and should keep on working persuading North Korea to stop making weapons. In order to persuade North Korea, we need more help especially from China."
NBE00020,"I deeply regret that North Korea launched the rocket. This country spend much money on arms not on food for its people. Furthermore, the US heard the launch and decided to stop the support of food. I worry about the life of North Korea's citizens. I strongly believe that North Korea should abolish dictatorship as soon as possible. I hope that North Korea gets the democratic government and society."
NBE00021,"First , I was relieved that no one was injured in this rocket launch. But I have strong anxiety about the future of Japan and North Korea. The people of North Korea are under bad food condition. And Japan government is not ready for North Korea's military action. We must think about the future of East Asia and act for peace."
NBE00022,"Like most of the responses here, I felt relieved. Thinking about world peace, this act must not be allowed. Problems that North Korea has caused between the other countries are not only this, there are many others. Governments of Japan and other countries must more strongly condemn the country."
NBE00023,"I think that North Korea should use more money for food for the citizen, too. They should do that for their country's stability. Thinking about our history, there were many governments that failed because they ignored their citizen's feeling. Even if they have the strong army, they should not think lightly about citizen's power. For example, they should think about the Arab Spring."
NBE00024,"I was relieved to hear that North Korea failed to launch the missile. Always we can't predict North Korea's action, besides the interior of there is lack of stability now by changing leader, so we should pay attention more."
NBE00025,"It was a relief to hear that none of the people has been affected by the rocket. But my primary concern is other countries' nuclear test. 3 days ago, India launched a missile. It cannot say that India may do and North Korea must not do. We must not launch a missile whatever the reason we have."
NBE00026,"I'll revise my opinion to receive criticism from ID12047. Partly, I agree with ID12047. Japan should also persuade China into joining in United Nations Security Council's resolution in order to show much stronger condemnation. But, in reality, it's very hard job. China is said to gain much profit from trade with North Korea. If so, Japan will continue to take strong measure to stop North Korea's provocative action."
NBE00027,"I thought that North Korea doesn't govern to the people, though its name is Democratic People's Republic of Korea. After I saw this news, my opinion is more strong. North Korea have to spend money to destroy the nuclear energy's factory and solve starvation."
NBE00028,"When I heard this news on TV, I was terrified and gave up on North Korea. Whatever reason they have, they must not launch long-range rocket. Because Launching long-range rocket must be a factor threatening world peace, of course around Asia. I think North Korea will try to launch long-range rocket again. We shouldn't miss their action."
NBE00029,"I think the Japanese government has a serious problem. When North Korea's long-range rocket launched, America got information about launch immediately. But, Japan took much time to confirm the launch. I fear that if North Korea's long-range rocket breaks up above Japanese territory. So, I think Japan should take a hard look at crisis management."
NBE00030,"North Korea's government says the every people agree with current politics, but it has many problems -exile, Illness and hunger, for example-. I think the highest priority should be given to the health and happiness of the people!"
NBE00031,"I think it is very terrible that North Korea's rocket broke up around Japanese territory. If it had become reality, we might have suffered damage. And I think, if it were not for countries like North Korea, our world would be peaceful."
NBE00032,"As lest of others comment on the blog, I was also relieved of the failure of the DPRK's launching the missile. But, I think most Japanese does not realize the threat of that since they, I mean DPRK, always fail to do such a thing. Maybe that is not good thing so, we Japanese need to be more aware of it."
NBE00033,"In my opinion, we should think this problem from various angles. To be sure, North Korea should be imposed some sanction from other countries, as it disturbed order. If economical sanctions will be imposed, however, many people in North Korea will suffer from hunger and poverty. I wonder if people who are blameless should be punished. I think the most important thing is to show North Korean government how to manage itself and to go along with other countries."
NBE00034,"I have my opinion that however North Korea's rocket launch gave rise to criticism all over the world, North Korea will launch rocket again. But because of criticism by countries around North Korea, North Korea will fail to achieve its aim, supply of food and money and oil and so on."
NBE00035,"This North Korea's rocket made me think anew that North Korea is a very dangerous country. I think that they have more important things to do than reinforcement of military affairs, such as improvement of citizen's poverty and hunger. The launch failed, but I think they will launch a rocket again. In case of it, Japan have to be more careful and prepare systems perfectly."
NBE00036,"I have been interested in North Korea. So I was very surprised at this news when I heard it first time. I thought something might changed better after Kim Jong Il's death in North Korea. In fact, however, nothing changes against what I thought. Rather, North Korea goes worth. Someone should revolutionize the structure of North Korea. The launch of rocket failed this time. But North Korea is still serious threat to Japan. So we must pay attention to North Korea."
NBE00037,"I think this launch accelerate North Korea's isolation in the world. The ""satellite"" cost a lot of money that would improve the people's life such as food, health and education. In the country, lot's of children around my age are starving and only a few upper class people lead a luxury life. Japan have to make effort to improve the situation."
NBE00038,"Luckily, this time the launch project has failed. But there's no guarantee that next time the result will be the same. Needless to say its very dangerous. Japan must continue to do economic sanction, and we Japanese should be cautious about that country."
NBE00039,"When I first heard this news on TV, I really felt sorry for the North Korean citizens who suffer from hunger and insanitary conditions. The governments of this company never try to use their money to solve such problems, or even more, they spend a lot of money launching those rockets. . . . which will never be of use."
NBE00040,I am interested in North Korea. I felt relieved that there were no casualties. And the horror of North Korea was felt again. The government of Japan should addressed more quickly. So Japan should pay attention to North Korea carefully. I want keep more attention to the news.
NBE00041,"Despite North Korea's provocation fell to the failure, they will continue to provoke. The countries bordering North Korea such as South Korea and China are now undergoing severe political changes, North Korea will never disregard this chance. I think not only bordered countries but UN have to intensify the pressure toward North Korea to stop it's provocation."
NBE00042,"When North Korea failed to launch the rocket, Japanese government failed also. It failed to get information about the rocket. It didn't know whether the rocket was launched or not, and needless to say, whether the launch was succeeded or not. I suspect Japanese government have the ability to save Japanese people in a crisis."
NBE00043,"At first, I thought it became safer after North Korea failed to launch the missile. A sense of security that Japan has a great technique reliably enough to intercept the missile supported my thought. But an article which I read after the english class made my mind. The article said that Japan has a 80% success rate in intercepting the missile. I was very shocked about it. If North Korea succeeded in launching the missile, it produced a number of casualties 20% of the time! We cannot guarantee that next time will be safe like this time so I thought Japan should improve the technique of interception as soon as possible."
NBE00044,"Having read this article, I recognized the sense of crisis and thought about what Japan should do to cope with it. But, what I want to say is that Japan should not just criticize North Korea for conducting things such as launching missiles but should try to know why they are doing this kind of provocation, and then we should find a solution."
NBE00045,"I think the main purpose of North Korea's long-range rocket launching was to boost national prestige and to congratulate Kim Jong-Un for assuming the new leader. However North Korea's rocket launch failed. This failure to launch the rocket showed that North Korea lost prestige in a new order. Therefore I'm worried that North Korea will carry out the third nuclear test. Japanese government should watch out North Korea's action continuously. Concerning Japanese government reaction this time, I agree with ID12031's opinion. Japanese government needs to reexamine the ways of providing people with information to save nation."
NBE00046,"I'm relieved to hear that North Korea's long-range rocket failed, but also I feel very scary. There are some reason. First, I believe international relations is not good between North Korea and Japan. As everyone knows, there is the issue of abducted Japanese taken to North Korea. Some North Korean doesn't like Japanese, and it makes situation worthier. If a launch is successful next time, it is obvious that Japan would be threatened more than now. Second, I think North Korea takes pride in own country and abilities, and this failure will lead them to make better rocket enthusiastically. I expect they will try hard again and again and success in launching a rocket in near future. It scared me a lot. To cope effectively with a terrible situation, I consider that Japan should gather more information about them. Only a few information, we are not able to do anything good for Japan."
NBE00047,"When I heard that North Korea planned to launch the rocket, I was indignant at a lack of repentance. If I remember correctly, this is the third time to launch the rockets or missiles without the approval of North Korea's neighbors, like Japan. I speculate that this launch is for celebrating Kim Il Sung's birthday or appealing Kim Jong-Un's authority. Also I guessed that it would not be going to be well, so my guess was exactly right. Now, I am relieved that no one was killed in this matter. But I am afraid for the safety of the scientists of North Korea. Because the leaders have executed cruelly many people made blunders or resist the government. Since the leader changed, this action has been activated. If worst comes to worst, they have already died. North Korea may run a nuclear test or launch the rocket again in the future. In order to save the nation certainly, I suggest that the Ministry of Defense improve the system to announce. And needless to say, we should keep to paying special attention to this matter."
NBE00048,"As the article said, North Korea's long-range rocket failed. I am relieved to hear that. However, now I am worried about what North Korea does next. If they are going to make new rocket, it will make matters worse. I really want to say that Japanese government should think about North Korea's actions."
NBE00049,"Failure of the launch of the missile made me relieved. However North Korea is still furthering military development, so there are some uneasiness left. Military affairs of Japan is not prepared, so Japan will be threatened in North Korea. To solve this@@@Japan should elaborate the armament and the measure for protecting its own country rather depending on foreign countries."
NBE00050,"Many people say that they feel safer after North Korea failed the rocket launch, but I am not one of them. I am rather afraid that North Korea creates another rocket, likely to be a stronger one, to actually attack Japan. I think that the Japanese government has to be more desperate to prepare for anything that can happen. It is very important that the government makes Japanese citizens always aware of the danger they are facing and have them ready for escape."
NBE00051,I think North Korea will make a better rocket next time from experience of this failure. Japan should have a better military to protect own country.
NBE00052,"I felt worried about North Korea's future. Because I would expect Kim Jong-Un to reset his country, govern people to guarantee good life of people but he ordered rocket launch. To launch rocket and nuclear missile means North Korean people is more severe life. Now North Korea is further isolating itself by engaging in provocative acts. I think that many countries, especially China and Russia should put pressure on North Korea."
NBE00053,I was relieved to hear the news and I want to ring an alarm bell. Certainly North Korea failed to launch the missile. But a nuclear test will be made again. The national government did not show North Korea strong manner. I think this is the problem.
NBE00070,I disagree because I think that Senkaku island is Japan's island.
NBE00071,I think that Japanese government is really weak about diplomacy. So I think we need a strong leader like Mr. Ishihara.
NBE00054,"It is fear to have felt, when I looked at this news for the first time. Although the missile test went wrong this time, next, it may succeed. If it is a nuclear missile, Japan destroys completely. Therefore, a foreign country needs to put pressure more. So I think it is a international problem."
NBE00055,"I felt that even if the leader was changed, North Korea didn't change, or even got worse. The old-fashioned political system in this country need reformation, and should be democratized. To realize this, the most important partner of the North Korea, China should make move to change this country, but I think it is difficult."
NBE00059,i also think it is very terrible that North Korea's rocket broke up around Japanese territory
NBE00060,i think Japan should not have a better military to protect own country.
NBE00061,I think North Korea's rocket is terrible.
NBE00068,"I am worried whether scientists concerned with this failure will be killed. As soon as Kim Jong-Un get this state, he purgeD a high officer who had made a mistake. Therefore I think that he may purge the scientists too."
NBE00065,"I strongly agree with this comment. Japan is near North Korea and Japan has no organization for battle. Of course, pacifism is very important and indispensable, but I thought that how we deal with the problem of nuclear terror. At the same time, I like South Korea, so I care about the country and issue of north and south."
NBE00066,"I partly disagree with the opinion above. I suppose what we Japanese must do first to deal with the problem is to talk with them. We lack that effort. Japan has declared not to have the force in order to keep its country safe. As a world's first model, we Japanese should think the way to solve such problem without the military force."
NBE00067,I think nuclear weapons are frightening. Abolition of nuclear weapons should.
NBE00069,"According the article , North Korea's long-range rocket failed. I hear the news, I feel relieved."
NBE00062,"I think, this news is so terrible. In fact, North Korea's rocket launch failed. But, if North Korea complete this technology, they surely aim at Japan. I'm afraid of that. And, I get angry at Japanese government. North Korea is near to Japan. But, information about this happening was so slowly. The government have to tell important things to nations more quickly."
NBE00058,"This time their rocket launch failed, and we are relieved to hear that. But it is not sure whether they will fail again next time. so we should prepare. But we can't shoot down their missile without other nation's help. In this case, it was US surveillance satellites that monitored the launch. And needless to say, we should maintain good international relations with China and South Korea. It is impossible to keep North Korea from using a nuclear weapon and assaulting other countries, without the cooperation of all nations. But should North Korea alone be condemned ? Many countries still have a nuclear weapon and other dangerous weapons. They don't use them now, but no one can declare that they will not use them forever. Certainly, North Korea is dangerous. But we shouldn't forget North Korea is not the only one nation that is dangerous."
NBE00063,"When I heard the news, I was very surprised. I was anxious for the launching. I want North Korea to behave on common sense and don't want them to make world dangerous. Also I think Japanese authority should have courage to say no to them."
NBE00064,"I agree with the opinion because I think Japanese diplomacy as weak knee. Japan will be worried, if the stance change."
NBE00056,"Many people make fun of North Korea's failure in launching the rocket but because their military powers are quite violent, no one will be laughing when they succeed. I thought that North Korea's experiment in launching the rocket was fearing for Japan as we do not have military powers to fight back."
NBE00057,"Many people are forced to live a poor life in North Korea but still they cry when Kim Jong II died and they have high respects for their leader. I think this is because they don't know how the government works in other country and how people live in those country. I think that if North Korea has a money to make weapons, government should use those money to help nation have a better living. This missile problem might seem like it is a problem between North Korea and the country around North Korea but I think this is a problem essential to settle, to make North Koreans living better too."
NBE05556,"I feel so terrible. If Japan might be attacked by North Korea with rocket, I couldn't sleep easily. I want to be peace."
NBE06810,"It is lucky that nobody got injured this time, but if the North Korea restart testing nuclear weapon we have to be aware of them always. That means we will have to carry so much stress in our life. Needless to say that is not the way people live, so we have to solve the problem immediately."
NBE05528,"North Korea should realize that they have been accused of their action by many countries. And, they are received an economic sanction, so they should refrain from provocative behavior. But, we can not solve the problems only by sanction. We have to negotiate with them positively."
NBE05992,We do not never do war. Even if we are attacked by rocket launch which made in North Korea. Because we know it's terrible to do war by our experiences. So we should talk to them and find peaceful resolution.
NBE06921,"I feel relieved to hear the news that the launch failed. Also I think we have to be a good terms with North Korea. If North Korea has hostility for us, North Korea may try to fire the rocket again"
NBE06383,"I think that Asian countries around North Korea should impose sanctions on that country. As it is, North Korea repeat rocket launch."
NBE05968,I think so too. I can't speculate what their plot to do next too. So we should think about them carefully. We must not look at this problem as bystanders.
NBE02055,"I can't assert that North Korea is bad completely. Because, confusion of the Korean Peninsula was caused by Japanese Occupation and confrontation of the U. S. and the Soviet Union. So, Japan, U. S. and Russia have to walk up to North Korea, and think together about what should we do to each other. We have to give to North Korea a chance without speculation of major powers."
NBE02708,"I think that development of technology should not always be criticized by others because some technologies are useful for many people. But this development of rocket makes situations of other nations which are the outskirts of North Korea such as Korea, China, and Japan bad and so dangerous. North Korea spends so much money for developments, on the other hand, the people of the country are hungry and starved. They are not only given wealth but also information. In short, they are also victims. So, I think it is necessary to give them chances that will change the system of the country by providing them with information of the whole world."
NBE01308,"I think North Korean couldn't withdraw their remarks. If this case continue in the future, they may not be able to do such things which is more serious. In this point, they resemble old Japan which couldn't do the same things. So I think Japan can act to soothe them as one who can understand their thought. We need to pay attention to Japanese government action, not only to North Korean or American's one."
NBE01539,"Many country recognizes that we should use nuclear weapons as a means of the deterrent, but North Korea tried to use these weapons. In this case, I think that conversation with North Korea is very important. We should offer North Korea that if it stops provocative actions, we offer much economical and materially assistance. The most important thing is the life of people of this world, so I think strategic contract with North Korea is needed."
NBE01850,"I fear North Korea. They have a core and a ballistic missile. A missile can be struck if it thinks that they will strike to Japan. In North Korea, since information is shut, information is not transmitted to here. If North Korea attacks to Japan, war will start. However, since there is no information, we cannot do it at all."
NBE02811,"North Korea is one of the most dangerous countries in the world. Perhaps they do not think their behavior makes themselves isolated. Pacifism is stated in the modern world, then why do they appeal to weapons? I think they believe that having military force is important in order to increase their influence at the international level. However, this is a wrong idea. If one country wants to join the major powers, the country should discuss the world problem and be in a spirit of cooperation. Consequently, I resolutely oppose the action of North Korea."
NBE02813,"I think this is a serious issue of Japanese security. Because, we have no forces to attack but only defense. However the environment is changing rapidly. We have more things to keep the peace than before. We should be a north wind not the Sun. We need to made North Korea fall silent. The world has changed. Article nine of the constitution of Japan will never protect us and maintain the peace."
NBE02808,I have absolutely no idea what North Korea's views are. I guess North Korea knows it is trigger of retaliation if they attack some country by their atomic weapon. I wonder why they do menacing behavior. Japan as a neighbor of them have to discuss this problem with all the countries of the world.
NBE02809,I cannot understand what the head of North Korea. But it must be the provocation for all countries loving peace. And they intend to catch the attention of some rich countries like Japan and US. In that way North Korean government can have Japan and US to supply living necessities.
NBE02810,"This is a very difficult problem and we should think it seriously. We also believe that movie has a big impact. North Korea is one of the hardest to please countries, so I do not want these hostile mood to last and I hope good relationship between countries."
NBE02812,"Is there any necessity to consider the North Korean side? I doubt. The North Korean is heretical in this international world of these days. Taking a conciliatory attitude toward them is not good, I think."
NBE00088,I can't understand how the people want to do cosmetic procedure feel. I shudder at the mere mention of it. Bury the implant in own face? Its so horrible!
NBE00084,"I don't understand the necessity of changing one's face through cosmetic-surgery. Patients have to run a risk as well as pay much money. If they want to restore their youthful look, they can have massages instead of cosmetic surgeries. They must be safer though it costs money and time."
NBE00094,I don't know whether cosmetic-surgery is right action or not. But I believe that it has a big risk to hurt our body. I want to change my body but I will not to change it because it is too dangerous.
NBE00103,"I agree with the cosmetic surgery. Because I think it's natural for people to want to get beauty and being confident in own looks is very important. Actually, people appearing on TV program featuring plastic surgery often look lively and nice after the operation. So I also think cosmetic procedure including ""chin jobs"" is one of ways to live happily for us and no one can criticize for that action."
NBE00147,"i think it is really hard say whether cosmetic surgery is right or wrong. because as ID12028 say, it is natural that people wants to be beautiful and also other people say surgery involves high risk. but i believe if person wants to be beautiful he/she should do surgery because advance in medical technology can get rid of person's unconfident looks and make person's life happier. . . . . . maybe. . . ."
NBE00151,"I didn't agree with the cosmetic-surgery at first because it cost a lot like 1 million yen for just one, small operation. I thought it's waste of money and we should use the money for something else. But as ID12028 said, it's natural for people to want to get beauty. Some are not satisfied with their looking and envy their nice-looking friends. And in some cases, so-called ugly students become the target of bullying. So I understand their feeling. But I still cannot agree with the liposuction because it's just the result of lack of effort. If people want to get thin, they should reconsider their dietary habit and start exercising not just depending on surgery. I know some people cannot lose their weight because of some kind of diseases but in most of the cases, I guess such people are overeating. Anyway, I can agree with cosmetic-surgery except for liposuction."
NBE00150,"sorry, ""1 million yen"" is correct"
NBE00105,"To tell the truth, I don't really care whether they do cosmetic surgery or not. We humans have the right to chose whatever we wanted to do, so it's up to the individual choice. But if I were asked to do cosmetic surgery, I definitely won't do that. It seems very painful to me and, moreover, I feel sorry for my parents by hurting the body they gave me. But if an individual can augment happiness of his/her life by doing cosmetic surgery, I can't stop them. You only live once. Just try what you think is the best !!"
NBE00132,"I think it is personal liberty, so that it is up to her/him as ID12029 said. She/He do cosmetic surgery because she/he doesn't like her/his look and doesn't have confidence for her/himself. If she/he has a lot of money, it would not be a problem at all. ID12015 said he can't understand at all why they do cosmetic surgery, however, I can understand their feelings. To tell the truth, I did straightening teeth, and I believe it is similar to cosmetic surgery. Many women want to be more beautiful any time. We do diet and make efforts, for example, however, our efforts are all for nothing sometimes. It's so vain. These days, technology has been developed day by day, so I think she/he who want to be change should try cosmetic surgery once. I bet her/his life would be different from the past."
NBE00139,"I agree with ID12029 and ID12049's idea. Whether you have plastic surgery or not depends on individual liberty. If you want to become beautiful, you might have plastic surgery after deeply thinking risk of it failing. What is more important than this, you should not have prejudices against the people who have plastic surgery. Especially in Japan there is the number of the people who have biased view against plastic surgery. Incidentally I don't want to have plastic surgery because I am very afraid of being operated."
NBE00086,"I think it dependent on the person whether cosmetic-surgery is carried out. In Japan, many people want to change their bodies. It is natural to want to become more beautiful. But I don't think so. This is because I want to take good care of myself."
NBE00137,"I am sure there are a great number of people who wish to be more beautiful and imagine the result of cosmetic surgery. It is natural that living people seek the beauty. But I hear that it is too expensive and so risky that they tend to hesitate to have surgery. And, as ID12055's opinion, Generally Japanese tend to scorn people who underwent surgery. For example, some actresses whose figures have changed obviously are criticized on the Internet. I think this is the biggest issue about cosmetic surgery. We should be more tolerant to this matter. Whoever hopes and afford to have surgery ought to carry out without any hesitation. By the way, if I get rich in the future, I may hope surgery."
NBE00098,"I heard that straightening our teeth helped us build up our health. I don't think too much cosmetic surgery is good, but I don't clearly say that cosmetic surgery should not done. Having cosmetic surgery makes people feel confident and happy."
NBE00126,"I don't think I want to do cosmetic procedure because it costs a lot, and it's dangerous. But I can understand why many people want to do it. Of course, I admire the person who is a handsome. In the end, I think it's free to do cosmetic surgery or not."
NBE00114,"I think cosmetic surgery is a way to lead a better life. If you do cosmetic surgery and can make your life better, it will be meaningful deed. However, even though you change your face, you can't your life unless you change yourself. And it costs a lot and may be dangerous. So you should drop into deep thought before you do cosmetic surgery."
NBE00111,"Cosmetic surgery occasionally fails. So, this procedure has risks. But, I have no reason to disagree with cosmetic surgery. There are a lot of people who worry about their own looks. For some people, this problem influences their lives and works. So, I think it is inexpensive to dissolve these problem to spend money. Anyway, cosmetic surgery is a personal matter. Other people shouldn't interfere. If we undergo cosmetic surgery, we should do our responsibility and judgment."
NBE00128,"I don't think people should not have cosmetic surgeries. Whatever we say, we are likely to judge others from their appearances. Therefore some people have senses of inferiority as they don't want to live any more. If they thought that they couldn't live without having cosmetic surgery, I think that will be OK. So I generally agree with cosmetic surgeries. But some people depend on cosmetic surgeries, run through their entire money, fail surgeries, repeat it endlessly, and fall into what we call 'cosmetic surgery hell'. Although I don't deny cosmetic surgeries, in order not to be in such traps, people should consider it again and again before having cosmetic surgeries."
NBE00122,"I think cosmetic surgery is very important to some person. Because it becomes a tool in order to lead a good life. When I dislike my face, it may be able to lead the life it is better to cosmetic surgery. So I think cosmetic surgery is not but."
NBE00091,"To be sure cosmetic surgery may be important to some people. I can understand their thought. But I can't think cosmetic surgery is good. At least I have not thought I want to do that. As many people said, cosmetic surgery cost a lot and is very dangerous. Doing something to body is very awful for me, even that is normal surgery."
NBE00095,"I don't think plastic surgery is bad. I'm not woman, but I can understand of hoping to be beautiful. One of my eyelids is with no fold, and other is double-fold. I really dislike them! Men feel beautiful to the symmetry things. So my face is not beautiful I think. I think if their problems can be solved by money, it's so good. It's the best way, no one feel sad, everyone feels happy, if you understand operations' danger."
NBE00090,"I think it's unnecessary to change each face. I have never thought that I'm handsome, and It's the natural that everyone wants to be handsome, pretty, beautiful, or nice face, however we should accept each inborn face. However ugly your face is, someone loves you!! In addition cosmetic surgery cost a lot and it's unsafe. In short I think it's needless"
NBE00096,"I can understand feeling of people who want cosmetic surgery, but I don't want to do cosmetic procedure. Because it take a lot of money and it's very dangerous. I think everyone should have confidence to face more. I looked at the picture of Bruce Forsyth, I was surprised at the size of his chin."
NBE00093,Thinking to want to restore our youthful look is good . So I think cosmetic surgery is not bad. However cosmetic surgery hurts our bodies and it's very dangerous. Under certain circumstances we died from cosmetic procedure. So I think cosmetic surgery is not worth taking risks.
NBE00101,Cosmetic surgery has been popular recently in the world. I think it should be important if surgery is not endowed from the parent face. I want my children to cosmetic surgery is not absolute.
NBE00085,"I suppose that these kinds of cosmetic surgery will be more popular in several years , and that not only in the US but in Asian countries such as China, South Korea etc, the demands for them will be rapidly increasing year after year. Today, these operations still cost too much, but as the technology is improving, these cost will lessen and many more people will undergo them without thinking seriously."
NBE00092,"I think that we have freedom of choice. But it costs patients a lot of money to be operated on for cosmetic surgery and maintain their bodies or face. Furthermore, as the article, if people are operated, most of them come to want to be modify other parts. In the end, their bodies or face will lose their shapes. It is true that if you are operated, you may be beautiful and gain confidence. However, it is the only short term. So I strongly believe that it is better that you aren't operated."
NBE00083,"A chin is charge of various functions such as mastication. Thus if we have cosmetic surgery on our chin, we may look nice, but the original functions may decline at the same time. I think we shouldn't have cosmetic surgery which exposes us to health hazards."
NBE00112,"In Japan, implants are unusual surgery. The patients try to hide that they did cosmetic surgery. This is because Japanese environment can't accept cosmetic surgery as a usual thing. On the other hand, in America or Korea, many people do cosmetic surgery in order to become younger. It shows that America has many kinds of people in country, so that they are used to accept different points of each other. This is one of the good points of American culture. At this point, I think Japan should learn this culture."
NBE00136,I think it is okay to do cosmetic surgery if the person wants to do and need it. It is expensive and dangerous so I would not recommend the person to do so unless if the person really needs to.
NBE00113,"I myself don't want to do cosmetic surgery. I think what the person is like is far more important than how he/she looks. On the other hand , I admit that there is a opinion such that ones first impression is quite important and it's greatly depend on ones features. So, I don't care other people do cosmetic surgery."
NBE00133,I think that the cosmetic surgery will damage your body or heart sometimes. The result after taking the surgery might be different from your ideal. I recommend that the person who wants to have cosmetic surgery need to think about that danger. I do not want to have the surgery because I feel so dangerous to have the surgery.
NBE00131,"I think that it is individual freedom. Desire to become beautiful is a natural thing. Even if it is able to sympathize, I don't want to have plastic surgery. Plastic surgery is different from makeup or diet, I feel like it is denying oneself. Moreover life does not necessarily become bright just because you have plastic surgery. Not only appearance but an inside is important. Things will turn out fine if you have enough determination."
NBE00140,"I think people who have plastic surgery abandon themselves. If you want to look better, you need to make extra special efforts. I never thought of having plastic surgery, but I have been trying various things to look better such as doing some running and restricting the amount of food for reducing fat. People should confront themselves and do their best to get better look."
NBE00134,"When I read this article, I think this news shows how Japanese and people around world feels about plastic surgery. I had read the article that 80% of Korean have plastic surgery (Not sure all Korean or only women). Also, many of them publicize that they had plastic surgery. On the other hand, Japanese want to hide whether they had plastic surgery. I think this is one of examples that show Japanese ""shame"" culture."
NBE00077,"I think that plastic surgery is no good. Faces are one of most characteristic parts of people. To process them would confuse their relationships, have a bad influence. When you want to change yourself, you should improve your inside."
NBE00089,"I can understand why there are people who would like to change their body or face by plastic surgery. They believe that if they get their ideal bodies and faces, they could get their ideal lives. But, I think that plastic surgery is not good. Our bodies and faces are given by our parents. If we change our bodies and faces by performing operations on those, they must unpleasant. So, I don't think I would like to have any plastic surgeries."
NBE00082,"I oppose the idea of changing faces and bodies artificially. The effect of cosmetic surgery is not permanent. That is why some people is compelled to have surgery again and again. As a result, they could lose their identity. I argue that you should accept your appearance and make an effort to development many thing except for your one. Then you can get your confidence."
NBE00075,"I have some complex with my face. But I haven't want to have plastic surgery. Because my face is important identity of myself. If you change your face and body by plastic surgery, it means that you lose your identity. If you change your face, you lost reliance and have more complexes about your looks. So I think that plastic surgery should not be done in any account."
NBE00072,"I think whether people decide to change their faces or other parts should be depended on their own mind. For some people who think their looking is not good, it may be wonderful that they can modify their bodies with new technology. But I am concerned about something. Do surgeons give customers enough information about their operations?There must be some risks with the procedure. The customers should know about them. The doctors should explain the details of the operations to their customers and the customers should think with that explanation."
NBE00120,"I am opposed to cosmetic surgery. This is because it may lead people who get the operation to being frustration. For example, Michael Joseph Jackson had had an operation in succession because of his wish that he wanted to be more beautiful."
NBE00135,I don't understand why people want to change their own face. Their face came from parents therefore it might make parents feel bad.
NBE00087,"I firmly think committing a cosmetic surgery is not good. I always emphasis that naturality is the best. Naturality helps people to maintain own existence. Furthermore, it makes more variety world, and society. I think having a cosmetic surgery means concealing own existence. Besides, however medical treatment has improved, actually there are tremendous risk when doing cosmetic surgery. Sometimes cosmetic surgery brings terrible side effect. Therefore, I think doing cosmetic surgery is no proper."
NBE00097,It is good for us to mind ourselves and make ourselves better on outlook. But i don't think cosmetic surgeon is good for anyone because we are the children of God. We are given our own body and it's natural for us to differ from each other. So we should be proud ourselves and enjoy crude ourselves.
NBE00074,"Personally , I can't accept the cosmetic surgery because there is a high possibility of failure. If operation fails, patients will perhaps suffer more than ever before. But cosmetic surgical procedure may give some people hope. So I think no one can criticize such operations."
NBE00108,I'm really sorry to be late for posting my comment. I felt you should think how serious it is to make your body changed. Your body is inherited and it is one of the evidences shows you and your parents are family. So you should treat your body more carefully.
NBE00118,"I don't think that cosmetic-surgery is good. Because doing it costs much money and one mistake can cost a person his life. I don't agree that South Korean people operate with ease. I think that the face is personal, so cosmetic-surgery shouldn't do easily without considering well."
NBE00143,"I agree with the cosmetic surgery as I understand that everyone would prefer looking better. I would not hate myself not just because my looking is not perfect, but I would be more satisfied with my appearance if my eyes were bigger, face was smaller, and etc. Since the technology and techniques we have today have extremely improved in the last few years, it should not be criticized as much for the people to have cosmetic surgery. Like ID12003 said in his comment, cosmetic surgery may give some people 'hope', which can be explained as hope to live, smile, and love themselves."
NBE00144,Technology and techniques*
NBE00129,"I disagree with plastic surgery in two ways. Firstly, plastic surgery can industrialize the medical system. As our society is appearance-oriented, plastic surgery is in high demand. Plastic surgeons can make a lot of money these days as well. Thus, many medical students apply to specialize in plastic surgery. On the other hand, specializations important for public health, like internal medicine and general surgery are waning due to the lack of talent, as these departments promises significantly lower pay as compared to being a plastic surgeon. This tendency polarizes the medical system and threatens public health. Secondly, plastic surgery can undermine individuality. With the plastic surgery, people can transform their appearance to whatever they want. Because media broadcasts a unified look, people admire that particular appearance, and seek to achieve that through plastic surgery. Thus it can be said that plastic surgery and the media makes people lose their individuality. These are the reasons as to why I disagree with plastic surgery."
NBE00124,"I agree with cosmetic surgery because all the people have a complex. If a complex is in appearance, and is improved by plastic surgery, the person becomes a positive feeling and can have confidence in himself, I think that it is good. There is prejudice for cosmetic surgery still more in Japan and will take time so that cosmetic surgery becomes common"
NBE00148,"Because doing cosmetic surgery is not only making people beautiful, also fixing the part of his/her wrong body part. When i was in Canada, my friend got hit by a baseball and broke his nose, and when he came back from hospital his face looks weird. so he did cosmetic surgery and fix his nose. so i strongly disagree with just saying cosmetic surgery is bad."
NBE00138,I agree because she out the problem I also considered. we think that the prejudice for surgery is one of the biggest issues.
NBE00107,"I agree with cosmetic surgery. It is common around the world except Japan. I think it depends on private liberty. Even though there is still a prejudice about plastic surgery in Japan, the time will come when it is in general use."
NBE00080,"I think it is free for individuals to reform their face. Butt I don't agree to cosmetic surgery, because I don't want to reform myself. I want you to think well cosmetic surgery like this news."
NBE00115,"Human's pursuits of beauty know no bounds. If the patient feels satisfied, that's OK, I think, but personally I don't want to be operated any plastic surgeries because there is a big risk of malpractice."
NBE00073,"I don't agree with the cosmetic surgery. It's true that most of us have a hope to change our face. I think my face is our parents' present, so however ugly it looks, it shouldn't be changed. Moreover, changing the face so much is bad for crime prevention too."
NBE00116,"I am for the cosmetic surgery. It won't be a big deal to others, also, it would be the chance to make them feel confident. I suppose people who want to do it have difficulty feeling themselves confident. Cosmetic surgery surely help them deal such problems."
NBE00078,"I think everybody can do the cosmetic surgery if they want to . no one has the right to stop them and also, people have the right to do what they want to. I know that all the girls want to look nice and pretty, and I think there are no problem about what they think. Some people say that ""your face is given from your parents so don't change it"" but I don't think so . Children can't choose their own face when they are born. If people can't be positive or happy because they think they look ugly, I think they should do the cosmetic surgery."
NBE00121,"I do not entirely agree with cosmetic surgery, but if some think cosmetic surgery make themselves confident and positive, I think it's good. Recently, a more casual type of cosmetic surgery called ""Puchi-seikei"" have become famous. Yet, there are some cases of failure in surgery operated by uncertified doctor, so people should be careful."
NBE00109,I felt you should think how serious it is to make your body changed. Your body is inherited and it is one of the evidences shows you and your parents are family. So you should treat your body more carefully.
NBE00110,"It's because I don't agree with the cosmetic surgery. Your body was inherited, in other words, given by your parents. The right to change your body is not only yours, so I disagree with it."
NBE00081,I think un orthopedist should be permit.
NBE00099,"I have same opinion about cosmetic surgery, too. I want to straighten my teeth because I want to grin with confident, not smile. If I have straightened my teeth, I will have confident to laugh. I think it is natural for people to want their look nice."
NBE00100,"I see that it is horrible to bury the implant in own face, but I don't agree with this opinion. I guess someone who wants to make them beautiful has very strong mind. They want to change their face from the bottom of their heart. They don't think it is horrible to bury the implant in order to make them beautiful. That is why I disagree with that opinion."
NBE00104,"I think doing cosmetic surgery is personality problems and it's natural to want to be more beautiful especially for women, so I think it's permitted for anyone. People selecting cosmetic operation have the rights to live freely. In fact, people became good-looking must have confidence in them and also become happy. It's the most essential thing in nice life."
NBE00117,I've commented almost the same thing. There is no reason to deny the plastic surgery since it does not harm anyone as long as the surgeon makes mistake. It would make the patients feel confident and also make them look nice. What's the problem?
NBE00119,I think shaping is scary. That is damage to the body.
NBE00079,"I totally disagree with this comment. I know that our face is given from parents. . . but so what? Children can't choose their face. If they look ugly, and feel bad about it, they can't live happily. All the people have a right to live happily. It is written in our national constitution. Satisfaction with face will make people positive. Being positive, you can make more friends. It's not always like this, but I just wanted to say that this happiness chain is likely to happen. About crime prevention, I don't understand what he means at all. It's no matter who change the face and although if cosmetic surgery is considered as illegal, the victims change their face if they need to. Law can't stop victims doing cosmetic surgery."
NBE00076,"I oppose the idea of changing faces and bodies artificially. The effect of cosmetic surgery is not permanent. That is why some people is compelled to have surgery again and again. As a result, they could lose their identity. I argue that you should accept your appearance and make an effort to development many thing except for your one. Then you can get your confidence. Machi Hattori I agree this comment. Face is fact of identity for a people, and it is important for them."
NBE00106,"It is true that the concept of handsome will vary according to the country the person belongs, but whether to change his/her face is entrusted to oneself so I believe we can just leave them to make their won choice by themselves."
NBE00127,"I think it is freedom to do cosmetic-surgery or not. If you want to be more beautiful, it is the one way to realize it. I think there is no problem you will be more positive and enjoy your life by doing cosmetic-surgery. But it is necessary to consider about costs, danger and so on."
NBE00125,"I agree with ID12028. That's why all the people have a complex. plastic surgery involves danger. If a complex is in appearance, and is improved by plastic surgery, the person becomes a positive feeling and can have confidence in himself, I think that it is good."
NBE00130,"I agree with this opinion because I have same idea as him. In modern society, decision about oneself is freedom. Because of this, no one can interference with personal decision. This comment reflect this kind of spirit very well. If I have to choose agree or not, I disagree with plastic surgery. But I think let plastic surgery as personal liberty is democratic thing."
NBE00102,"I disagree to having plastic surgery. It is because there are no bounds to improve the section that we don't like in our face. So, it is wasteful to invest money in the plastic surgery."
NBE00123,"I agree with the cosmetic surgery. Because I think appearance is the most important of first impression. Also, when I choose my girl friend, appearance is the most important factor."
NBE00141,"I found it surprising that people are age want to have a plastic surgery. It will obviously make your appearance good now but I do not think it will stay forever. Appearance will be consumed by time anyway but loosing your appearance without it being consumed, I think it's kind of pathetic."
NBE00142,"I think it is personal liberty, so that it is up to her/him as ID12029 said. She/He do cosmetic surgery because she/he doesn't like her/his look and doesn't have confidence for her/himself. If she/he has a lot of money, it would not be a problem at all. ID12015 said he can't understand at all why they do cosmetic surgery, however, I can understand their feelings. To tell the truth, I did straightening teeth, and I believe it is similar to cosmetic surgery. Many women want to be more beautiful any time. We do diet and make efforts, for example, however, our efforts are all for nothing sometimes. It's so vain. These days, technology has been developed day by day, so I think she/he who want to be change should try cosmetic surgery once. I bet her/his life would be different from the past. I do not agree to this as I do not like the fact that people want to change their faces. Even though it is a minor change, your body was born from mother who suffered pain to give birth to you so I think you should take care of your body."
NBE00145,I strongly disagree with the person who wrote this comment. He should not have written such a thing as it might hurt those people who wish for cosmetic surgery. I do not think he will ever understand other people's feelings.
NBE00146,I thought this comment makes a good point. I think that it is definitely natural for people to get beauty and confidence in own looks. I also agree with the idea that no one should criticize the people who wish to have that 'natural thing' for them to live the only one life they have.
NBE00149,"I am not against people having plastic surgery strongly because sometimes, getting a good looks would change one's life in a better way. But I still can't have a good understanding for it. Having a plastic surgery means that they will not be able to see their real faces or body again. Especially for face, it could also mean that their baby wont have the same look as their parent forever. And for their parents, they wont be able to see the face of their child that reminds of their wife or husband anymore. I think this is really sad thing. Now a days plastic surgery is getting easier to have and in some country it is thought as something normal to do. But I think people should think a lot before having it especially if they were young."
NBE02006,"I think people tend to do cosmetic procedure repeatedly. So we should not do it in the first place. We should accept ourselves as we are. Besides, people don't care about our figure as seriously than we think. We should have greater self-confidence."
NBE02814,"I often watch TV programs about cosmetic surgery. People who appear in the program lose them mind. A woman in the program had a problem with her skin. Her chin skin was sore. It's not surprising people want to be beautiful, but we should consider influence on ourselves. We need treat our body carefully."
NBE07513,I have never thought about it. Why would you do that to yourself?
NBE00176,"I tried to make good vocabulary notes every time, but I have never made perfect vocabulary notes. Also, this is the first time which I thought about how to write good vocabulary notes again. I saw some notes in class, and I could find what is important to make a good note. I should write meanings, parts of speech, pronunciation, accent, and examples. Moreover, I think world maps are important part for good vocabulary notes. By using world maps, we can learn not only one word but also other words which connect with one word at the same time. Word maps help us to learn many words. From now on, I want to make a beautiful vocabulary note in order to improve my English skill!"
NBE00182,"I have made vocabulary notes just like the first example of one. but, I realized it is not good when I read this article. My note is no accent and example sentence and so on. I think that word maps is good idea. It becomes easy to understand the connection of the sentence make a good note refer to this example notes. I will try to make a good note refer to example vocabulary notes ."
NBE00159,"I have made my original vocabulary notebook including collocations and word senses, for around seven years. It gradually contained a lot of information, so I have revised it several times. Recently I forgot lots of information on it. I think my note have two faults. First it is too large to carry . It is B5 size, so I cannot review what I wrote on mine when I am on the crowded train. The next note should be smaller. Secondly I have not written English sentences and word's meanings in English. That is why I easily forget what I wrote. When I make the next, I will improve those faults."
NBE00172,"I want to refer to the third example of vocabulary note because each main words are very distinct and easy to find, also, we can remember the word family at the same time. Its knowledge will be necessary to write English composition. When I make my vocabulary note, I want to add the meanings of the words in an English-English dictionary. I think it can be useful for not only when we need to explain a word to another non-native speaker (according to this article), but also understanding real notion of the words. I really want to improve my English skill by ma king vocabulary note."
NBE00181,"I think most important for vocabulary note is careful. For example beautiful character, tidied up carefully etc... Because carefully vocabulary note is motivated to us compared with a dirty note. I would like to refer to the first example vocabulary note. But it is not good as it is. It is necessary to add the above some element. I am poor at English. So I absolute necessity perfect vocabulary note. From now on, I would like to make the perfect note."
NBE00158,"So far, I have written only Japanese meanings and synonyms in my vocabulary notebooks. This method is adequate just for expanding the vocabulary and enhancing reading skills. However, in developing writing and reading skills, adding example and collocations to the notebooks will be better. I'm often puzzled about how to use words when writing and speaking. Now, I'll try this new method. Writing part of speech and pronunciation may also be good way of improving listening and speaking skills, but it must be much better to listen to native native speaker's pronunciation."
NBE00173,"As you know, it is very easy to learn English in Japanese if you are not good at English. We Japanese usually think matters in Japanese, so I suggest them to learn English in Japanese at first. But after you get used to learning English, I mean after you have less problem using English, especially communicating in English, it is very important to learn English through English. That's because you never understand nuance of English if you keep on learning them through Japanese. I also recommend to learn English using an illustrative sentence. It is very effective to know how the word is used, and you can borrow those phrases when you actually write or speak English. But what we have to pay attention to most is that you shouldn't get satisfied just making vocabulary notebooks. What is important is to remember the words and have a chance to use them. You should make them in a way that is easy for you to remember in the most effective ways. Tips for those who is not good at remembering words: Aren't you using many hours just making vocabulary notebooks? Then stop that and reconsider why you are doing such a thing. That is to remember the words and actually using them in writings or in the real situations!"
NBE00165,"I think that there are three points to make better vocabulary notebooks. Firstly, you should write the words' meanings and accents. Of course, the purpose to make vocabulary notebooks is to learn the words that you don't know. It is easy to learn them by knowing their meanings . Furthermore, if you learn their accents, you can pronounce them. So you are able to learn their words not only by the sense of sight but also by the sense of hearing. Secondly, you should write the example sentences of them. By example sentences, you will be able to learn how to use them. And you can learn collocation. There are synonyms but words have also nuance. If you don't know collocation, you may not be able to convey your feeling. So it is necessary to write example sentences. Finally, you should write the images of the words. How to write is a picture, sentence and so on. If you have the images, it will be easy for you to learn the words. This is because the words become memorable and lead to collocation. Therefore, I recommend three points."
NBE00180,"When I learn new words, I lay emphasis on their practical use. If you learned a new verb by just memorizing its spelling and meaning, you will manage to understand the meaning of the verb in most passages. However, when you write compositions or speak in English using that verb, you will be at a loss about what is proper preposition for the verb , or what noun to use together, or the pronunciation of it. Thus I think that there's no use making a vocabulary notebook only with English words and their Japanese meanings, and that you should write the co-locations, pronunciations, and part of speech of new words to make a useful vocabulary notebook. In fact, rarely have I made a vocabulary note so far, so I will improve my vocabulary by making and using vocabulary notebook."
NBE00171,"I started to remember the English word from the middle grades become, until now to write an English word to the left, we have to remember to write the meaning next to it in Japanese. Note that I can not explain the meaning to native speakers, however. I do not know well what I say with how if you did not write a sentence using that word again. And now I think I want to make a note using the color easy to see the English meaning, and example sentences using the word rather than just write the meaning of a word in Japanese so."
NBE00160,"When I was a high school student, I made my vocabulary notebook. But it was written only the meanings of the words. I think the vocabulary note is practical more. So I try to do new methods of vocabulary notes. First, I try to use word maps. But it was difficult to understand and taking long time. So I try to add the example sentences. Example sentences are useful for memorizing words. I want so I don't forget that continue to make the vocabulary notes."
NBE00175,"I think the second example is the best vocabulary notes of all. Whenever I study English, I feel necessity to think in English. I'm poor at English. So, I always think English sentences and words through Japanese. This thinking way takes much time and sometimes makes mistakes. So, I want to learn the way to think from English to English directly. I'm going to make a vocabulary note like the second example as first step for English-English thinking."
NBE00166,"I think that no one knows what the perfect vocabulary notebook is. Because we have different own English ability, so what we want to need about English vocabulary notebook is different from each other. For example, when I was a high school student I want to memorize English words and its Japanese meanings. So I devoted much time to reading. Thanks to this study, I know many English words and its meanings. But I don't know how to use those words. This study is of no practical use. So refer to ""Vocabulary Notebooks"", I am going to search the most fittest notebook to me."
NBE00164,"There are difference between studying English and just learning English words by heart when we make the vocabulary notes. First, when we want not only to memorize words but also to study English, we should write many related words;collocations, word map, and synonyms on the notes. On the other hand when we just want to memorize English words, we should write English words and meaning by Japanese or English."
NBE00152,"I have made some vocabulary notes since junior high school student. There were various notes. I have already tried first, second and third examples of this article. And I like the style of first example. I think that type is clear and easiest to memorize. Of course, it is useful that there are English meanings or example sentences and I can remember other information. But my notes with too many information were often complex and it was hard to continue to memorize the words. So I want to try other type of notebooks but try not to make too complex notebooks. I want to create notebooks that are best to memorize for me."
NBE00168,"I'm poor at learning English words. So I can't speak like native speaker. If the thing I want to speak comes to my mind in Japanese, I can't translate it to in English because my vocabulary is too poor. But I'm sometimes said ""Your English is not bad. Are you good at English?"" I can't understand why they think it. But when I speak English, I try to use easy English and I think it is better to continue speaking than think of difficult expression. I want to speak difficult things, I explain it by easy English. So my best way to learn new English is to explain that word by my word."
NBE00162,"When I make my I wrote only Japanese meaning so far. This style is so easy to do. But, It isn't good for learning English. I think, is most effective method. However, It is lacking. When I make my vocabulary note next time, I will write Japanese meaning, pronunciation, and word family as third example. And, I will write example sentence, too. I want to make perfect vocabulary note!"
NBE00185,"I think english meaning notebook is the best. I have been made english meaning notebooks which written main word and synonym. It is useful because you can memorize many words at once. If you use this method, you can remember another word even if you forget word which you want to speak."
NBE00157,"When I made vocabulary notebooks, I wrote only English words, Japanese meanings, and synonyms. So I sometimes had trouble making English sentences because I didn't know how to choose the correct English word. By incorporating example sentences and word map like the second example and the fourth example, I can make efforts to realize the improvement of my English skills. I will practice these ways in order to make the best vocabulary notebook for me."
NBE00178,"There were only English words and Japanese meanings in my vocabulary notebook. I had thought it was enough. However, When I saw several notebook example, I noticed my notebook was incomplete. I should write accents , pronunciation, example sentences and family words. It may take a lot of time. But if I do not so, it'll take more much time to remember and understand English words. I want to improve my English notebook and make my English ability better!!"
NBE00184,"I have made vocabulary notebooks only like first type. It is easy to make, and it is specialized in memorizing only english words and their meanings. However, especially when I write English compositions, I have no idea on how to use and link english words, even if I know words and their meanings. Just being linked with their meanings doesn't consist right sentences. So it is necessary to learn collocations."
NBE00167,"I thought that I have to improve my note. After last lesson(week), I thought I have to improve my note and did it, However, I still have some points to improve. I realized that electronic dictionary has example sentences and pronunciations, but it is not enough to make a good note."
NBE00161,"After had a lesson which learn about taking notes, I had realize that my note is too simple. So, I improved my note within 3 points. First, I added example. I think memorizing word with example is important, example helps people to memorize more easily, and properly. Second, I marked a accent. Since flow is important in English, word cannot be a complete English without considering accent. Third, I added synonym, memorizing synonym provide people to memorize wide range of words, also it helps to write natural sentences."
NBE00169,"Though it is not interesting for me to make a vocabulary note, that is very important in order to speak English more fluently. I will make my own note soon and want to be a good English speaker. But i wonder how often check the words i don't know . If i check all the words, i must be tired. Could anyone tell me how often i should look up the words i don't know?"
NBE00154,"I have never thought about the good vocabulary notebooks. so this article gave me the opportunity to improve my vocabulary notebook. I took in the collocation and synonyms for my own notebook. I think my new notebook will improve my English skills. But the most important thing is continuing, not beginning. Therefore, I want to continue using new vocabulary notebook."
NBE00156,"I have never thought about ""What makes a good vocabulary book"". However in this class lesson I came to have a first chance to see many types of vocabulary books and to think which one helps more. I tried every types after the lesson and finally, I chose the one with English meanings. Now I'm using it almost everyday and it helps me a lot!"
NBE00174,"I used to make vocabulary notes in many ways when I was high school student, but I could never make the best one. However, I found a ""better"" way to make it. It's ""Word Map"" style! I could learn many words by making and using this. One of the good feature of this way is that you can learn other words related to the word you wanted to learn at first. So I think ""Word Map"" is a good vocabulary note."
NBE00179,"I think that it is very important for me to write good vocabulary note books. But I was a high school student, I had written English words on the left , and Japanese meanings on the right. Though I could pass the entrance examination war, I realized that I would forget vast English words and Japanese meanings quickly. To memorize them effectively, I think that it is the best method for me to use a map which students has divided the word into its different word senses. ""Since English word has a lot of meanings, its method will enable me to memorize many senses with putting them in order."
NBE00183,"I think that the vocabulary notebook that words' meanings are written in English is the best. Because, it makes us to get used to English, and we can also learn other words when we look up one word. But, if the word is very difficult, it is necessary to add Japanese."
NBE00177,"When I was studying for entrance examination, I used flash cards to remember english words. A good point of this method is that a word's meaning came into my head as soon as readying a phrase. However, I had a little difficulty using words in conformity with the contexts. From this experience, I enumerate several synonyms, clarifying in which context the word should be used."
NBE00170,"I want to make notes such as second example and third example. But I'm taking notes like first example. Although there is a lot of missing information , but I think first example is the best note because it is very simple and I get used to making it."
NBE00163,"I make a vocabulary notebook from when I was a junior high school student. It is like first example. . . but, after I see those some way of making notes, I thought that I should reconsider my vocabulary notebook!! I think it is better that there are example sentences and the word's pronunciation for my improvement of English skill. In this class, I could know good ways of making notes!! thank you!!"
NBE00155,I makes vocabulary notebooks from when I was a freshman of the junior high school student. I am not good at remembering English words. So I made a lot of vocabulary notebooks. And I used to made vocabulary cards. To make vocabulary notebooks and vocabulary cards is best way to learn English words by heart. I learned a lot of things in this class.
NBE00153,"I think vocabulary notebooks is very important tool to memorize the words or foreign languages. It's true that Simplifying the layouts to see clearly is necessary, but only re-read the note on which written down the meaning of the word for two languages is not effective. The most important is "" how the words are used"". So, when we make the notes, we must memorize the example sentence."
NBE00255,"I was very impressed by this story. Even if she got to be able to walk by the support of the ""ReWalk suit"", it must be hard for her to complete a long-distance marathon. she could walked about only two miles a day, and it took 16 days to finish the marathon. If I were in her position, I could not keep running. Although she could not receive the official medal, she must be very happy to get the special medals which a dozen of other runners made."
NBE00232,"I received impression in this tale. Her challenge is very amazing and I respect her challenge spirit. If I am same position as her I will be discouraged. so I think she is amazing. And I think surrounding support is important for her challenge. For the reason, it was able to obtain the medal which is not formal as for her"
NBE00247,"Same as ID12063, I was very impressed by this story. To tell the truth, first of all, I felt the marvelous ability of the bionic suit. This ReWalk suit could prove that enable paralyzed people to walk himself/herself publicly. I thought that the stuff of the company that designed the suit had been enthusiastic about their works and done everything in their power for paralyzed people. I want to praise them. Also, I noticed Claire Lomas's great perseverance. As ID12063's opinion, Even if she got the suit, he must have made an effort and keep doing hard work for a long time. At this time she could not receive a medal. I think it is natural. However she should be considered to be one of the runners who could reach the goal. We ought to give her and her family a big hand."
NBE00246,and their family.
NBE00253,"After reading this story, it made my heart warm because Lomas never gave up during the race and when she finishes her 26.2 mile marathon, other runners in the race gave their own medals which i think they were also cheering her to finish. and also i was impressed on advance in science that we know today. this story realize me how enormous technology is and technologies are upgrading every seconds and it is making our life affluent."
NBE00248,"As ID12063 and ID12054 say, this news impressed me deeply. Her efforts and hardships must have been beyond my imagination until she completed the marathon course. I respect her efforts and achievement. I realized again that it was important to do it without giving up until I finish. In the future I hope that bionic suit will spread in the world and the people paralyzed below the waist will be able to walk as technology develops and bionic suit becomes cheaper."
NBE00226,"I have three impression things in this story. First, Wearing bionic ReWalk suit enabled Claire Lomas to complete the 26.2 miles. I felt her will was very strong. Second, a dozen other runners in the race have given her their own medals in recognition of her achievement. I think that they would really look up to her in a way which she was trying without being discouraged by adversity. Finally, she raised more than yen 11 million for a charity which funds research to develop treatments for paralysis caused by a broken back or neck. I think that since she had many support, she would repay to the handicapped."
NBE00243,"When I read this article, I'm surprised that she decided to run long-distance marathon even though she became paralyzed. Most of all, I'm impressed by her toughness to accomplish the goal. I think this achievement will help other paralyzed people not to lose their hope."
NBE00240,"As many students said, I was impressed and surprised by reading this story. I can't imagine how hard she tried to walk everyday. It must be very difficult time, however, she bore her hardship! She made it and succeeded in her life! I respect her. I think I am not able to try hard like her. I expect I should have desire to improve myself :)"
NBE00196,"I was astonished at her patience and effort. She continually went on walking for no less than 16 days! It's quite true her bionic ReWalk suit made it possible for her to move her paralyzed leg more smoothly. However, more important factors in her achievement are her strong belief in overcoming the physical disability and her families' cheer. As she said, she sometimes worried whether she could finish the marathon, but she continued practicing little by little, encouraged by her families. Without these two factors, she couldn't have completed it. The disabled will be encouraged by her achievement."
NBE00245,I was impressed by this story. I guess it was hard to complete a marathon in a bionic suit but she did it. I think many people have encouraged by her.
NBE00208,"I was happy after reading this article. It is recently said that science technology damage the Earth and threaten our life. It is also said that only think about convenient. However, science technology can help us such as Lomas. I think science technology will developed more convenient to us."
NBE00239,This story impressed me. I hope these technology will develop for handicapped person.
NBE00198,"Re Walk suit was very useful to complete the marathon. However, I think her emotional strength was greater. If I were her, I gave up to run to the last. I learned the importance of challenging through this text."
NBE00207,I was very moved by this story. I can't imagine how hard she made efforts. But I can understand this challenge was very difficult to overcome. I wish that this success encourage other people who have handicaps. I was also surprised at science and technology. We can't live without it now. I hope technology develops and makes our lives more and more comfortable.
NBE00220,"When I read this article, I was impressed about the bionic suit. There are many people who have handicap in the world. Because of some handicap, handicapped people have to give up normal life style. However, they also have rights to spend normal life like us. Thanks to this bionic suit, I think many handicapped people's dream will come true. I hope technology of bionic suits will develop as soon as possible."
NBE00202,"This news so impressed me. This British woman's effort is beyond my imagination. Marathon is not easy for a person with a healthy body. With her handicap, she puled it off. Her action is worthy of praise. And, I also be moved new technology. I hope developing of science save all of paralyzed people ."
NBE00222,"In my opinion, the woman's success is greatly owing to her strong will. To be sure, she couldn't so much as entering this competition without ReWalk suit. But, no non-handicapped person could succeed in finishing the race only because of his/her normal body. It is ones will that leads to the person's accomplishment. So, the suit only helped her coming up alongside of other people without any disability."
NBE00228,"I have read another article like this. A handicapped person is likely to contribute, make a fund which help people get over the difficulty. I think this is good!"
NBE00249,"Having read this article, I was so impressed with it. I think people in this society should learn how to make great efforts from the runner. And she taught us that you can do anything if you try or challenge hard. Regarding the bionic suit helped the runner finish the marathon, I was very amazed by the fact the technology has actually grown this far. So, I look forward to that recent technology will keep growing and give people a hope."
NBE00204,"I was pretty impressed by this article. I thought Technology could make an impossibility to be a possibility. This article is not only about the Technology but also about the Human Spirit. If she was not Lomas, or she didn't have the physical handicap, she wouldn't make efforts and be attracted our attention. Having handicap is not good, but she could succeed with it. Therefore paralysis had her to do well. I praise her courage and toughness"
NBE00219,"I am impressed with this article. I feel Claire Lomas has a tough spirit. Of course, if there wasn't a bionic suit, she couldn't complete a marathon. But, I think that we need skills and a courage to complete a marathon. So, I feel that we have to have strength of mental and skills to attain a great thing. I want to be a strong man. And I don't want to give up if I face troubles like Claire Lomas."
NBE00223,"I was surprised at and impressed by her efforts and strength. If I were her, I would only be sad about my handicap. However, she didn't so. She didn't lose her handicap, and she rather overcame it with her unimagined efforts. I think she would encourage many people who have handicap. I also think the bionic suit which helped her success is wonderful. I hope this suit will help more handicapped people to lead better lives."
NBE00186,"I want to celebrate her achievement and also want to put emphasis on Amit Goffer's accomplishment. I hope that more technology for goods for the people like her will be developed. For that, people who study the technology should be supported by nations or groups like NPO. Especially, I heard that many Japanese researchers have abilities to develop the technology like this. We should support them. Also, we have to think about people who need goods but can't buy them because of the luck of the money."
NBE00197,"I was amazed to see this article. Claire Lomas completed a full marathon although she has a tough handicap. I strongly appreciate and admire her great efforts and feat. I'm not one of the disabled but I cannot do such a thing. I think the technical innovations we didn't realize around 10 years ago made her wish come true. And I suppose she could not had got over her obstacles without many supports of her family, her husband Dan and their daughter Maisie, and her parents and this her great achievement will surely encourage the disabled all over the world."
NBE00237,"I was so impressed with this article. I think it was not easy for everyone to complete. The strength of her spirit is so inscrutable. The more technologies improve, the more we forget importance of effort to achieve something. Also, her great achievement didn't consist of only fine technology, ReWalk suit. I think this news encourages everyone, including non-handicapped people and handicapped people."
NBE00216,"I was encouraged by reading this news. I think everyone who read this news were encouraged too. Clair Lomas, who had disadvantages of becoming paralyzed, completed a marathon because of a bionic suit but I think that is not the only reason why she made it. She could not have crossed the goal line without helps of her family, her husband and their 13-month-old daughter Maisie, and her parents. What we can learn from this is that you can overcome predicaments if there are emotional mainstays you get from someone very close to you. Also, I was very impressed by her charity work which funds research to develop treatments for paralysis caused by a broken back or neck. She did not satisfied just with extending her possibility, but she is also trying to open up more possibilities for those people who are suffering from the same situations as she had. Maybe, we have to not only focusing on a bionic suit but also on the importance of relationships between human beings, when reading this news. Do not forget that ""what you cannot overcome by yourself can overcome with the help of each other""."
NBE00191,"I was moved by this article. I thought she was so brave to have made a decision to attend such a hard sports like marathon instead of her difficulty. I think I can't do the same thing if I were her. Her guts was really great. And, because her husband, daughter and parents cheered her everyday, she could continue the hard exercise and success like this. I guess. Well, I want to be like Lomas. I want to success like her no matter how horrible adversity I will be faced to."
NBE00209,"Whose success is the example like this? I think it is a human power. Of course, the person helped by technology strived very much. And the technology was invented by the people who want to help another people. Many technology successes were not technology's successes but human's successes."
NBE00233,"I was very impressed about this story. If I were her, I would have give up running marathon. so I think she is very tough!!! When her husband was married her, he did not mind her handicap. He is very nice guy."
NBE00215,"After reading this article, I made two remarks. First, I suppose it's important to have strong spirit and make an effort. If I lost my legs, I would give up even walking. In this case, though Lomas put on a bionic suit, continuous effort probably made her success, I think. Second, being supporters encourage people who work hard to do something. For me, parents and friends often cheer up when I feel sadness or stress, so I want to be a good supporter for someone at one time."
NBE00206,"This article is moved me. I think that Claire Lomas has a firm belief. But in the world, however strong belief she has, there is a thing which she cannot do by herself. I think that there are three reasons why she could complete a marathon. Of course, first reason is that she made efforts to run the marathon. Second reason is due to bionic suit. Third reason, this is the most important reason, is that her family supported her. Probably, if she practice running a marathon alone, she may give up. But she achieve reaching a goal because her husband and her daughter continued to cheered up her. I strongly believe that there is a close bond of family. Furthermore, I think that we should try to develop links of the charity which support people with a disability and people who became paralyzed. It is possible for us to become paralyzed or have disability by accidents. However, someone who became paralyzed can enjoy sports by using advanced technology like bionic Re walk suit. But it cost them a lot of money to use advanced technology. So we need to increase the number of supporters who participate in charities for them."
NBE00231,"Since I have an uncle who have trouble walking due to polio, I was deeply impressed by this news. I also heard of achievement in the study of artificial sight. This kind of achievement will be light of hope for handicapped people."
NBE00188,"In this story, we can see not only an achievement of a paralyzed British woman, but also the development in science and technology. I think these technologies will help more and more people in the future. New scientific developments may be changing the world. But encouragement from others is also important. I think no matter how well-developed science and technology, the importance of the ties that bind people will not change."
NBE00234,"I was deeply moved by this story. Claire Lomas completed a marathon in a bionic suit as she crossed the finishing line in London on Tuesday 16 days after the race began. Although she has a physical disability. If I had been her, l would have given up the marathon. She deserves to get a medal from other players. I thought she would have a heart strong enough to overcome adversity. she"
NBE00236,"I was impressed by this article, and I admired her success. It is not easy to decide to run 42.2 kilometers though she is paralyzed. This achievement taught that importance of having ambition and making an effort to us."
NBE00213,"I was very surprised when I read this news. Even though the body was crippled in an accident, I was very surprised that she ran 42 kilometers. I have not finished the marathon. I would like to finish a marathon someday."
NBE00190,"Scientific techniques enables us things like we have never thought. A paralyzed person completed marathon. This is really amazing. To raise the convenience is of course, to bring out the dreamer in men is a part of scientific techniques too."
NBE00212,"I was so impressed with her patience. If I were Claire Lomas, I would give up running a marathon. She didn't give up because people around her welcomed her from the bottom of their heart. I want to run a marathon someday, too."
NBE00218,"I was so impressed by this article, too. And I thought her achievement was supported by not only the technology but her strong spirit and cooperation between her and people around her. So this is why this article attract many people, I think."
NBE00203,"This article was surprising for me. I could not believe the first. . . but, this is the fact. I can't imagine her despair when she know that she can't walk by herself. However, she never gave up and walk and walk. . . in the end, she was able to achieve!! I was moved this story."
NBE00229,I think that the woman cheer people who has handicap. Scientific techniques enables us to do things like we have never thought. I want the handicapped not to give up anything because of their handicap.
NBE00217,I was very impressed to hear the news. And I received courage and felt a weight has been taken off my mind. Because one reason is that a handicapped person such as Lomas taught us importance of effort and never giving up. The other reason is that science is of use. It is often said that science technology damage the earth and our life. I hope that science technology is good for us.
NBE00242,"I was very impressed after hearing this news. She completed the 42.195km course even she had difficulty in working. I understand that the bionic suit was good, but her heart was strong therefore I was so impressed. I tried half-marathon in April but after the marathon I thought that it is hard to finish the full marathon because I was so tired. I understand how hard the marathon is, so I think that what she did is wonderful."
NBE00252,"I was extremely impressed by the story and also encouraged by what Claire has done. She has achieved such a great work in marathon not just because she was wearing a high-technology bionic suit, but also because she had her mind very set and tried amazingly hard. If I were running in the same race as her, I would have given her a big hug and told her that she should be very proud of herself. Also, it made me happy to know that other runners gave their medals to Claire for her great job. They probably felt the same way as me."
NBE00189,"I was moved by hearing this news. Technology that helped her was very great. Nowadays, many people were bothered by physically handicap. So this bionic suits can help such a person. If many handicapped persons are helped by technology, the world will be better place. I heartily hope such a future made by technology."
NBE00256,This comment shows how great Claire is. I agree with this comment because I also think that her achievement is not only due to the bionic suit. Her continuous efforts made it possible. This comment is very understandable so I chose this.
NBE00210,"when I was read this news, I was very impressed and surprised. I absolutely impossible for me to complete a marathon in the body paralyzed. If I were her, I would have given up. I think that they were encouraged when people of the same situation with her was heard this news. I want to develop more bionic suit."
NBE00238,"For me, the article is impressive because the technology is used in a good way. I think technology is extension of human body. Thanks to high technology, human did a lot of achievement. This story is obvious example of that kind of achievement. These days, invention of high technology is always controversial thing among people. But I think technology is neutrality thing. People should not impede invent technology. But I argue applying of invented technology must discussion by people democratically."
NBE00192,"I think ReWalk suit is very good thing! Because I think paralyzed people are helped by ReWalk suit, also ReWalk suit bring the joy of walking for paralyzed people."
NBE00187,"I was very impressed by this story. She ran marathon even she had difficulty in walking, it's so unbelievable and admirable. I belong to track&field club in Keio university, so I respect her spirit. And the development of technology is also surprising. ReWalk suit is hilarious thing, and it's very useful for disabled people."
NBE00224,"The development of technology sometimes cause bad effects like environmental pollution, but this news is a good example. The achievement of a woman with bionic suit makes a big hope for many people. I wish many more technologies will make our life much more comfortable."
NBE00225,"I was happy to hear the news as the technology made it possible to do a thing that had been thought to be impossible. I've heard a phrase as following: things that human can imagine are the things that can be realized. I do not remember whose wise it is, but I realized it true."
NBE00193,I think Technology is important.
NBE00199,"I also think if I were in her position, I gave up running. So her spirit was very tough! She received more important something than she could not receive the official medal."
NBE00200,Not only the high technology but also her patient spirit enables her to complete the marathon. I wanted to praise her brave figure.
NBE00230,"I was very impressed by this story too. The bionic suit enable the handicapped to walk freely. What a hopeful suit it is!! However, as ID12054 said, if it had not been for their perseverance, they couldn't use the bionic suits."
NBE00205,I was impressed this news. The strength of the woman's will and the help of her family are very beautiful. I hope the society changed into more comfortable place for handicapped people.
NBE00227,I think evolution of medicine is amazing.
NBE00194,"When I read this article I was impressed by Claire's family ties and encouraged by what she have achieved. She is loved by her family. I felt that their love and cheering for her encouraged her. That is why, I think, she can have made a decision to attend such a hard marathon and have achieved. And the story inspired me to greater effect."
NBE00235,"I was deeply moved by this story. Claire Lomas completed a marathon in a bionic suit as she crossed the finishing line in London on Tuesday 16 days after the race began. Although she has a physical disability. If I had been her, l would have given up the marathon. She deserves to get a medal from other players. I thought she would have a heart strong enough to overcome adversity."
NBE00214,I was deeply moved by this story. She never gave up. It is hard for a person with a normal too to run a marathon. she achieved this without being discouraged by adversity.
NBE00221,"I agree with her comment about a woman's marathon with bionic suit in Britain. This news made me happy like her and encourage that if I'll do things without giving up, any dream comes true. Also, I was surprised about bionic suit because I didn't know about it until I read this article. There are still many patients that want this new technology in the world. I hope this technology will help all people and everyone can make their dreams come true."
NBE00201,"Since moving paralyzed body is very painful, although she complete a marathon with putting on a bionic suit, her try deserves to be praised. By the way, after reading this article, I wondered normal people putting on this suit. Since this ReWalk suit can mimic the response of whereas's joints, it would be a great energy to move. At once, I had became to want to wear a bionic suit too."
NBE00195,"Her strong will that she didn't want to lose her disability made her run. And I thought she got a great sense of achievement. At the same time, a lot of people with a disability cheered up. Thanks to the progress of technology, she could try this race. Technology sometimes makes us happy."
NBE00211,"At first I was surprised to hear this news and a little moved. And the thing that she could run to the goal is so nice for her cuz she wanted to run again. But at the same time, I'm a little scared. For, we human come to make everything we want and that means we can use something we made in order to pursue some bad things."
NBE00244,I really impressed by this story. I could felt people can anything if thy have a passion. The sadness being paralysis is huge I guess. She got over the sadness and trying to encourage other paralysis people. This action can be honor. I wish i have same passion to going school.
NBE00241,"I agree with his comment because it is similar to what I wrote on the article. I was very impressed by this news. Although the British woman had difficulty in walking, she completed a long marathon(42.195km). His comment said that he could not keep running if he were in her position. This is what I thought exactly. She did it because she had a strong heart. In the future, I will try the marathon but I need to have strong heart like hers."
NBE00250,"Although she was not rewarded with a medal, I think it was heart-warming that she made it to the end with the bionic suit. In future, I hope this bionic suit will become much cheaper so more people who are physically challenged will be able to use it in their daily lives."
NBE00251,I had pretty much the same impression and I was also moved by the fact that she made it to the end.
NBE00254,"I thought this is really nice and heart warming news. But I also have other thoughts for this kind of news. I've heard of the news that man who has a artificial leg will participate in a Olympic because of his great performance at the last two Paralympics. When I first heard this news , I thought this is really nice news just like I read the news about British woman who run marathon in a bionic suit. But then I start to worry about the fairness. Maybe waring more expensive suite can make the runner run faster. Or maybe some player would feel unfairness to people wearing those things. But I'm sure that player wont be able to say so because it sounds immoral. I think it is really nice thing to give chance to handicapped people but I also think that this is not that simple problem."
NBE02815,"Her achievement made me be surprised. Even though she was said that she couldn't walk forever, she never gave up and to complete the marathon. I thought that she has strong will which is second to none. If I'm in her position, I wouldn't be able to challenge a marathon like her. Also, I surprised that the convenience of bionic ReWalk suit. I basked in that recent technology develops more. The bionic suit made me be surprised better than any other suit, but I often hear amazing suits recently. For example, there is the LZR Racer Suit. It is a high-technology swimwear fabric by Speedo. I hope that the environment is made such that the life of people become more convenient and the challenging spirit like Claire Lomas by producing suits which can develop and support physical ability."
NBE00353,"I guess the number of gay people in Japan is much smaller than in America, so the gay marriage issue may not be so familiar to Japanese. However this might be one of the most biggest issue for people all over the world because this is related to the human rights. I believe it's freedom for all people to love somebody, but in reality most of the countries ban gay marriage. And I wonder why such many people in America are against the gay marriage. In my opinion, their rights should be defended."
NBE00287,"I think that I agree with legalizing gay marriage. This is because there is individual freedom. Moreover, it is said that many gays have a lot of stress in their mind because they aren't accepted. So government should legalize gay marriage to relief their stress. If government legalize it, government should permit them to get tax benefits and adopt children. There are some reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, when they get a job, if they tell companies that they are gays themselves, some of companies may not employ them. Secondly, they need to get mental treatment. Furthermore, they cannot give birth to a baby so government has to consider adopting children. But, in view of politics, I think that Obama made a big decision. This is because Christianity ban gay marriage. Especially Catholic stick closely to Catholicism. In other words, Obama's remark is the same thing as throw away vote of Catholic. These days, there is the trend of accepting gay marriage. But I'm curious to see how it will turn out."
NBE00300,"This is the first time to think of gay marriage for me. In Japan, it's the unrealistic problem yet. I suppose that gay couples' marriage should be admitted if they want to do, but I against adopting children. Because their children have no mother and that will cause many problems such as bullying at school, mental unrest etc. By the way, media says Mr. Obama's approval of such marriage is one of election campaigns. I'm interested in eligible voters' movement especially young people."
NBE00321,"I think that gay marriage is individual free. There is no reason for opposing, if they are fortunate. Why is it prohibition in the United States? I think that the reason is that children decrease in number. The gay couple should not have a child. Because a child needs a mother absolutely. And the child who grew up at the special home has a high possibility of running to wrongdoing. So I think the conclusion of this problem is very difficult."
NBE00272,"For my part, at present, I can't agree to the same-sex marriage. It is said some people are afraid of being loved by gay people, and also said the birthrate in the country may decline. Both of them I 'm afraid too. On the contrary, however, these view may have some misconceptions. And history tells us that there were many gay people in ancient Greece and the Warring States period of Japan, which indicates the gay rights is not necessarily the problem specific to today. Moreover, the Japanese TV programs show that there are many gay people who is proud of themselves. The more Japanese people know them, the more they may be tolerate to the gay. In conclusion, now i'm against gay marriage, but in the future, I'll change my thoughts if I have more information about gay people."
NBE00319,"I think same-sex marriage should be admitted. Gay people loves partners of the same sex as heterosexual people love opposite sex, so no one or no law cannot prohibit these emotions. Is the birth rate of higher priority than human rights? I don't think so. In addition to institutional manage, government should enhance the understanding of gay people to solve problems springing from prejudice against gay people such as difficulty in adopting children."
NBE00271,"I experienced empathy with Obama's opinion. As there are so many people in the world, there are various ways of expressing love. So I think it is important to understand diverse love, and not to have a prejudice against gay couples."
NBE00315,"When I live in Japan , I think that ""same-sex marriage"" don't become the talk. In America, Mr Obama regards getting many votes for same-sex couples as the way to win in a sense. Meanwhile Mr Romney is against gay marriage. It is true that increasing rights for gay citizens is very important but I think that in the USA the religion has something to do with all things as such life. So we will have to see how things develop."
NBE00325,"This problem was hard to believe for me. In Japan, the number of same-sex couples is extremely small and the problem is not a big problem compared with foreign countries, Perhaps because religion is involved, such as. I agree that same-sex couples should be able to marry. If people fell in love a same-sex by chance, I think it can not be helped, and I think it is good if they get along in life. The number of same-sex couples in Japan is increasing recent years. I think the problem should be more considered by society as a whole in Japan"
NBE00332,I think it is individual freedom. Although I'm against to this. I expect that permitting same-sex marriage will cause a lot of social problems.
NBE00336,"I think that same-sex couples are able to marry because they love with each other. We can not say anything for that. If they can not marry even they love with each other, I think that it is not fair. There is no rule, like males have to like females or females have to like males."
NBE00341,I think same sex marriage should be legal. Same sex couple just love each other so I don't want them to give up to get marry because of the gender. But I think same sex couple should not have the right to adopt children unless the children understand about it.
NBE00343,"As most people here say, I agree with legalizing gay marriage. Whether you love same-sex or opposite sex depends on you. It is wrong that nation prohibits guy marriage. However as ID12053 points out , whether same-sex couple should be allowed to adopt children or not is big and complicated question. Same-sex couple should be allowed right same as opposite-sex couple but considering children, children should be brought up by mother and father."
NBE00342,"As most of my classmates say, I agree with I think that gay marriage should be acceptable legally and socially. Humans have the right to love person without regard to sex. None of my friends have confessed that he/she is gay. But if I get friends who are gay, I will be ready to accept them. And gay couple should be given the rights that general couples ordinarily possess. I disagree with ID12055's opinion a little. As they say, I consider that deliberating children's future and feelings is very important and necessary. We must not shun these. However, if some of children show their own opinion obviously, we can consider that gay couples adopt him/her. We should not respect only our guesses too much."
NBE00337,"I'm agree to gay marriage like others do. I do think it's their freedom to have marriage with same-sex and have a family. However, at the same time, I'm disagree with the idea of same-sex couple to adopt children. I don't think it's something wrong to fall in love with same gender, but to child, it could be differ. Also, when children got old without knowing father/mother figure, they tend to abuse their children. So, I think it's not suitable to let same-sex couple to adopt children."
NBE00334,"I believe that same-sex couple should be equal with others. As ID12044 say, I think the religious is the matter for them. Christian don't allow the same-sex marriage, and that is why same-sex couples are difficult to marriage. I know the religious is important for them, however, it is strange that human don't have same equal right. We are all equal before the low. I strongly support same-sex couple."
NBE00298,"When I read this news I was surprised. Although many gay people all over the world, I think that it has been certified in the United States and it have an appreciable effect. There are many gay people in Japan. I think that they will want to certified."
NBE00346,"The same sex couple should have some rights such as living together, getting married, and etc. But there is one thing should not be accepted, it is adopting children. Because, I think it is harsh for the children to know and accept the relationship of their parents."
NBE00266,"I think the marriage of gay couples should be legal as others said. They have their rights to live happily with person who they love. Well, but I don't think it will be. Especially in Japan, there are many people who have stereotypes to gay couples and this will not vanish in a short period of time. Although there are ones who think like I think, I suppose it's impossible to make allowance for gay couples to marry because it will be possible that those who married with same-sex partners will be persecuted by others."
NBE00283,"I think same-sex couples should be able to marry. If they love each other, why not marry? Everyone will have your love. Then, of course you'll want to marry your partner. Why must not same-sex couples marry? Though only they cannot have a child, it's important to marry. If they want a child, they can adopt. A lot of social problems are occurred if same-sex couples can marry. However more people will be happy."
NBE00289,"In Japan, there are not many people who are gay. So I have never thought about gay marriage carefully. But after reading this article, I think priority should be given to the both two people's feelings. Therefore, I agree with gay marriage. However, after marriage, they may be seen strange by other people. A lot remains to be done for gays to live under normal conditions."
NBE00273,"I agree with Obama's suggestion. This is because it is freedom of choice, which we all enjoy. We must respect the will of individual. I strongly believe we should treat same-sex couples as ordinary different-sex couples. In Japan gay people are not as familiar as in the US So I suppose lots of Japanese, including me, are surprised at this news article."
NBE00286,"I think we should not have a prejudice against same-sex couples. Because every people have the right to pursue their happiness. It has nothing to do with which sex they love. So I agree with Obama. I hope that more people become to think any people, even he is different from us, are equal and have the rights ."
NBE00276,"Gay marriage should be recognized in Japan. There is no problem about it, but a constitution must be revised. The government should discuss immediately. I want all people to do a better life."
NBE00306,"I guess this problem will come to Japan someday. Then, I think gay marriage should not be legal. There has been some gays in Japan. And, they play in television. But, there are people who criticize gays, too. If gay marriage is admitted in legal, the government has to discuss and amend the law. And, it takes much time to do this. But, I think the government has many problems to solve immediately. So, I think people should not discuss this now in Japan."
NBE00307,"This had been the big problem in America from many years ago. I have many friends in NY, and also there are many gay friends. Compared to Japanese, my gay friends don't try to hide their special characteristics. I think this is the good points in American culture. America is composed by many immigrations. Everyone accepted this situation and many kinds of people lived together. This is why gay friends can live without some feelings of shame rather than Japanese. I agree with President Obama about gay marriage. Thanks to this rule, many gay people can love each other like us and this help them except other gay people in all over the world."
NBE00257,"In my opinion, same-sex couples should be able to get married. Of course, I know there are various religions in the United States and some people think it is a bad thing. I think it is difficult that ALL citizens agree with guy marriage. There are lots of opinions in the country. But I think ""the government"" should not ban the marriage. If it ban the marriage because they are same-sex , does the government disturb the citizen's freedom of the marriage?If they love with each other and want to wed, the government can't ban the marriage."
NBE00292,"I think it should be followed to get married for same-sex couple. The first reason, I believe that there is really big love between them. So, I can understand their thought and want them to be happy. The second reason, orphans will get less because the same-sex couples can't make child by themselves. Of course, there are many things not to be followed traditionally, but to make everyone happy, we should change the rules or customs."
NBE00310,"I agree with Obama. Surely, same sex couples are rare. However, they are not definitely wrong. It is freedom whom they love. Guy marriage isn't different from ordinary marriage. Also it is important for us to admit various sense of value. So I think guy marriage should be legal."
NBE00301,"I certainly agree with what Obama has proclaimed. We humans have a right to love who we want to love and no one has the right to violate that kind of right. But Obama should also think about current situation of America. In America, still many people have the prejudice against same-sex love because of their religion or morality or any other reasons. So what I wanted to say is that we have to take into consideration of such kinds of ideas that people have in order to protect same-sex couples. What is best is that maybe gradually modify the thoughts of people who have a bias against same-sex marriage, not just ignoring the ideas of people who have bias against same-sex couples, and finally create a situation that same-sex marriage is a normal thing in the society."
NBE00265,"I'm in favor of gay marriage. The most important thing in democracy is to respect personal thoughts. Besides marriage is one of the most important event in our life. Therefore, gay marriage should be admitted."
NBE00295,"Though I know little about tax system, I agree with same sex marriage. Because they can't give up loving the same sex person. That isn't changeable. But I disagree with them to adopt children. For one thing, as they are both men the children won't be treated healthfully. Second, children can't choose whether they should be adopted them or not."
NBE00279,"When I read this article, I was very surprised, and thought this is very good news. In many countries and areas, same sex couple are not recognized by the public. Obama did so courageous decision. I wish this Obama's new method succeed. And, I think that Japan also have to recognized gay's marriage right."
NBE00322,"I think gay marriage should be admitted. Because they love each other as usual couple. If this thinking of love was not admitted, it would be violation of human right. But, It is difficult to admit gay couple."
NBE00269,"I argue that the institution of marriage has traditionally been defined as between a man and a women. If gay marriage is admitted, it will accelerate the assimilation of gays into mainstream heterosexual culture. The gay community has created its own vibrant culture. By reducing the gap of opportunities and experiences between gay and heterosexual people, the unique culture may crease to exist."
NBE00297,"Barack Obama said that same-sex couples should be able to get married. But still it is a very difficult problem. In my opinion, same-sex couples should not be able to married. Many people have a bias against gay couples and cannot accept their idea now. I don't agree with gay marriage as yet."
NBE00345,"As Barack Obama said, I think same-sex couple marriage should be allowed in other countries too. It is something to do with the human rights and everyone should be free. There is no way that they can stop them getting together."
NBE00308,"As to gay marriage, I agree to it. It's because people should have the right to choose partner who would make ones life more precious, I think. But, I can only feel that the president, announcing like this, thinks too much about gaining supports from those back gay marriage for following election. As a result, it's not clear to me if he really has strong creed to pay attention to same sex couples. Of course, I admit that by showing his favor to the couples, more or less, people has something positive to them, so it couldn't necessarily be said too much selfish."
NBE00349,"As many people said, i think this is individual problem. and what President Obama said is very courageous. I think same-sex marriage should be allow. Because i think marriage only relates to two people who wants to marry, and if it doesn't bring trouble to anyone i think this wedding should be allow. but if same-sex marriage cause any problem, we should ban as soon as possible."
NBE00261,"I think same-sex couples should be able to wed. Some people regard homosexuality as strange and sinful. But, people have the right to love irrespective of sex, age and nationality. So I think no one can criticize them. But I can't agree with the idea that same-sex couples should have the right to adapt children. Certainly, if they have a child, they can enjoy true family life. However, many problem may happen to their children. For , children may be teased because some people still scorn same-sex couples. And I think mother's love is necessary for their growth. Anyway, I think same-sex couples should have the right to get married."
NBE00326,"I think same-sex couples' marriages should be admitted. It is natural that you hope to stay with someone who you love. But, today, same-sex marriages are not common, it is difficult way for same-sex couples. I think Barack Obama's statement is very important one. I want other countries follow his examples and take actions for same-sex couples."
NBE00329,"I agree with homosexual marriages. I think prohibiting gay marriages runs counter to human rights. We investigate gay people's human rights with respect to marriage. In my opinion, happiness possessing rights, equality rights and privacy rights are violated in this scenario. The entitlement of happiness possessing rights is already guaranteed by first amendment in Virginia Bill of Rights. It is stipulated in 13rd amendment of constitution of Japan too. Freedoms without distinction of any kind of status are guaranteed by Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The constitutions of most countries guarantee this right too. And in 2003, Texas Supreme Court judged that the prohibition of homosexual activity is against the right of privacy. Actually, many countries like Portugal, Belgium, The Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, South Africa, Canada, Argentina permit same sex couple marriage. In fact the Netherlands have law of anti-discrimination. According to this law, gays have the same rights as heterosexual couples. These are reason why I agree with same sex couple marriage"
NBE00330,This is reason why I agree with same sex couple marriage
NBE00327,"I agree with Obama's opinion. The right to marry must be given to every people equally, and it enables us to live with someone. If someone loves others of the same sex, no one can criticize them and keep them from being happy. It is free to love whoever."
NBE00282,"I think that no one bother the right to say persons they love, "" I love you. "" This is a human right, of course, whether male or female. Nothing is crueler than that this right is denied. It is natural that they would like to marry and live with their lovers. So, I support Obama's opinion at this point. Why are there a right to forbid their love?"
NBE00318,I disagree with Obama's opinion. Gay must be prohibited strictly. There is only one reason to think so. Gay is not correct in ethics. A living thing in the earth have to leave offspring.
NBE00304,"I agree with Obama's opinion. I argue that everyone is given some liberties, a thought, a property, and even marriage. There is a person who argues that if gay marriage is accepted, it will accelerate the assimilation of gays into mainstream heterosexual culture. But there are many orphans in the world. So, I think they are able to be adopted by same-sex couples."
NBE00348,"It would have been quite difficult for gay and lesbian couples in the current society as many people do not even try to understand the ways they choose their partners for life. In my opinion, however, same-sex marriage should be allowed because I think that no one has a right to force someone to love or marry only opposite-sex person. I guess that same-sex marriage is criticized especially by Christians who regard it as it is against God, but other than that, it does not cause any problems."
NBE00350,"As she said, it is important to understand other people's love so we could not judge whether homosexual is right or wrong."
NBE00339,I agree with this. I think same sex marriage should be admitted but they should not have rights to have adopting children.
NBE00340,I don't think same sex marriage will cause many social problem.
NBE00333,"I strongly agree with her opinion because I also believe everyone must be has the same right either men or women. It would be discrimination if people distinguish between male and female. I convince that there is no matter to marry when they love each other. I have the acquaintance who is gay, however, it is nothing different from us. I think people should be more open for same-sex marriage."
NBE00344,"I agree with this idea. I think that Gay marriage should be permitted. But if this marriage are permitted, various problem will be caused."
NBE00263,I think that gay and lesbian couples have rights to marry. To marry is existing for lovers. There is no fatal gap between usual couple and gay couple. I hate people who discriminate gays and lesbians. There are a lot of people. So I think that each persons have their own right to be happy. Obama did great job.
NBE00354,"I disagree with this comment. First, it's not concerned whether anti-gay people exist or not. There is no bad effect on such people. It may be difficult for them to immediately accept gay people, but it's more difficult for gay people to give up to love their partner only because of law regulation. What I really couldn't agree with in this comment was that it take much time to discuss and amend the law about same sex marriage and this problem should not be discussed now because the government has many other problems to deal with. We cannot say like that because this is ONE BIG PROBLEM to solve. Any problems should be tackled as soon as possible because we cannot run away from problems."
NBE00294,I agree with legalizing gay marriage. We should not have a prejudice against homosexual person. I think that Whether or not to marry is individual freedom. Gay marriage will increase in the future.
NBE00291,I agree homosexuality because lave affair depends on will of the individual. However I disagree Mr. Obama's this decision. He use the problem of sexually to win the election. Gay suffer from the criticism of society long years and they fight to win theirs rights. I think Mr. Obama's decision makes fool of their suffering.
NBE00267,"I agree to same sex marriage. Because, I think this is freedom of individuals. So I think government should be permit same sex marriage."
NBE00259,"I don't agree with Obama. It's true that many form of love exist and I don't condemn itself, but Gay is ethically problematic. They can't leave offspring, so government shouldn't admit officially. That's the reason why I disagree with same sex couple marriage."
NBE00314,"I agree with the idea. In the past, transsexualism was not admitted socially, so it was thought to be really strange thing to marry the same sex person. But as the science, especially medicine, developed, it has been scientifically admitted that there are people who cannot love different sex people. So, I think the marriage of gay person should be admitted."
NBE00311,"I agree with legalizing same-sex marriage. Gay or lesbian people naturally have human rights. But in America, there may be many problems to solve. If most of those could be solved, the policy must be adopted at once."
NBE00305,"I support Obama's decision and I'm sure it should be admirable! To begin with, it's strange that the government can obstruct individuals' marriage. We have right to get married with our lovers even he/she is the same sex of us. We should think about this problem again with this as a start."
NBE00284,"I disagree with his/her comment. Everyone thinks if there two fathers and no mother in a family, children would confuse. I think, of course, children would confuse in Japan, and children even in America which is a melting pot of many races and a liberty country would confuse, too. However, that thought is wrong. Believing in a mother and a father in a family is not imaginable; conservative and outdated. These times, there is no impossibility in the world, I think. Therefore, of course, I agree with a same sex marriage and adopting a child between father and father. This is why I disagree with his comment."
NBE00312,"It is sure that there are some people who are afraid of gay people, but I think many similar problems are there between men and women, so this cannot be the reason of banning same-sex marriage. Besides, he admits that many gay people are proud of themselves. Can't this also be the reason of agreeing same-sex marriage? So I disagree with this opinion."
NBE00313,"The good point of this opinion is that the contributor admits that same-sex marriage problems are not so familiar to Japanese, and he mentions about the problems of human rights. This insistence is very clear and agreeable, so I choose this one."
NBE00274,"Of course, There still be lot of other problems Obama must face and address, especially the current economic condition and the unemployment rate this country has."
NBE00275,"That is because in Japan, Gay marriage may be regarded as ethically problematic, but in some countries, I think, it is no problem. I believe what people value depends on each person."
NBE00268,I think homosexuality should be permit.
NBE00293,"I think if the gay marriage is forbidden, the marriage becomes only way of making legality children. I think living with his loving person is the happiest in his life, so maybe I love woman, but probably I love men. When that, I want to live with him if it isn't legality somebody says."
NBE00288,"I disagree with the opinion that gay couples' marriage should be admitted if they want to do, but I against adopting children. Because their children have no mother and that will cause many problems such as bullying at school, mental unrest etc. This is because its thought is a kind of prejudice for gays. This is the first step to improve the surroundings of gays. If there are regulations for gays, it will leave room for prejudice. we should build equal society for all human beings."
NBE00328,"It is said that it's the unrealistic problem. I think that it is because gay people are much smaller in Japan than US. Certainly, the number of gay people in Japan is smaller than US. But proportion is probably about the same, I think. And gay people in Japan are likely to hide their identity (loving same-sex people). So it's just that we don't know about it, but they are everywhere. They are living, frightened whether their secret is out. We should turn our eyes to minority more. And I think it is the very biased view that same-sex couple's adopting children will be bullying because they have no mother or father. This is discrimination against single mother or father's children, isn't it? I think same-sex couple who loves their children heartily can overcome such things easily."
NBE00285,I think same-sex marriage should be admitted. The right of individual is most important. We must not restrain the rights in that the problem will happen .
NBE00317,I favor gay marriage. It is one of the human rights.
NBE00309,"I agree this comment in that it mentions ""this is the first time to think of gay marriage for me. "" In fact, we seldom consider getting marry with same-sex partner as myself. However, world' getting more and more global, we should see things globally not only internal."
NBE00260,"I disagree same-sex marriage. It's true that individual is free, but It makes social unstable. Gay is ethically bad cause they can't have offspring."
NBE00264,"I think same-sex couples should be able to wed. Some people regard homosexuality as strange and sinful. But, people have the right to love irrespective of sex, age and nationality. So I think no one can criticize them. But I can't agree with the idea that same-sex couples should have the right to adapt children. Certainly, if they have a child, they can enjoy true family life. However, many problem may happen to their children. For , children may be teased because some people still scorn same-sex couples. And I think mother's love is necessary for their growth. Anyway, I think same-sex couples should have the right to get married. I agree with this opinion. I think same-sex couples should be able to get married, but shouldn't be able to have children, Because if a same-sex couple has a child, there is a strong possibility that their child receive bad treatment."
NBE00302,"I certainly agree with this idea, but it takes a long time to have consensus of its citizens. It is especially true to country like USA because this country is religiously strong rooted nation. But USA is the also the country that is acceptable to new concepts and they have been improving their country by themselves, so I believe that they can gradually have the right answer for this matter and I hope the government will help the minority to some extent."
NBE00280,All his words are what I would like to say. I would like to the society be freer for people who love the same sex because they have the right they can do so. It's a fine human right. The government should help them use the right. I think the suggestion in this comment is good to realize my ideal world. This is the reason I strongly agree with this comment.
NBE00281,"I disagree with this comment because this comment opposes gay marriage. At this point, my opinion doesn't accord this comment."
NBE00331,"I disagree with him because he violates gay people's human rights. He suggests gay people marriage should be banned for the birthrate. I argue this opinion is utilitarianism thinking. According to this logic, Majority people can violate minority people's human rights because of utility of entire society. This logic made a lot of problem in history. World war 2 is vivid example. And this kind of logic will violates minority's human rights."
NBE00316,"I disagree with this opinion. Because I think that individual rights should be respected. In Japan, I felt that a fixed idea's strong that man and woman should marry. It is very important for us to respected the minority opinion."
NBE00299,"I agree with Obama's opinion. However same sex marry is not accepted in Japan, same sex marry is proper. It is because they have right to get married with a lover."
NBE00290,"He said ""the birthrate in the country may decline"" but if government ban the same-sex marriage, the problem can't solve. Moreover, this news is about America and the country which is declining birth rate is Japan. This opinion is not logically I think."
NBE00323,Her comment is correct. But there is no example about social problem. So this is bad as comment.
NBE00324,I agree gay marriage is individual free.
NBE00258,"If they can't leave offspring, it should be depended on themselves whether they marry or not. The government should not say about citizens' opinion."
NBE00277,"I've reminded of gays who play in television in Japan. At first, I feel them disgusting but, repeating seeing their video, I realize that they were criticizing gays either. At that time I was very impressed, and I really agree with the comment above."
NBE00278,"Though I understand homosexual's position, however I think homosexual love is not to be yield. Before human came out to earth, there were no homosexual love but heterosexual love. In addition, having a homosexual love-life makes themselves make easy to get a disease. Moreover it makes birth rates to decrease. Therefore, It will be the big problem in the near future."
NBE00320,"This kind of argument is clearly anachronistic, and the evidence which support his opinion is too illogical. I can't believe those who have old-fashioned opinion like this."
NBE00262,"He don't explain why he thinks gay marriage is bad ethically, and I disagree with the idea that all living things must leave offspring. Is he living to leave offspring? I don't think so. All of us have the right to pursue our happiness!!"
NBE00270,I can't agree with the opinion that leaving offspring is the most important of loving someone.
NBE00303,"I disagree with this comment. Because I think marriage is personal liberty. Though this comment points out 'If gay marriage is admitted, it will accelerate the assimilation of gays into mainstream heterosexual culture', I think it is not. Same-sex couples can adopt orphans and pay various taxes."
NBE00296,"I don't think so. We can't deny their love and I want him to explain what is the ethical problem, what is your ethic. There are so many kinds of people and thoughts so we should think calmly."
NBE00338,I am in Obama side. I think gay or lesbian should be together if they love each other. Nothing can stop the feeling that you love someone. I also don't care that gay or lesbian got marriage.
NBE00335,"I disagree with a part of her comment. She said that it will not happen that the marriage of gay couples should be admitted in the future. I disagree with this part. If the people get to understand more about the same sex couples and marriage, marrying of them is going to be natural thing. Most important thing is people need to understand them. I think it is possible."
NBE00347,I agree to same sex marriage as long as they do not take charge of children in anyway such as adopting etc. This is because I do not think same sex marriage is a natural thing and it could lead to bullying. If people want to make same sex marriages they should make their children involved in their self-satisfaction.
NBE00351,"I just can't find what is wrong about same sex people having a marriages. If they love each other why can't they marry? If it comes to a problem of whether they can have adopted child , it is difficult. But I think there are some ways that same sex couple can have a child just like we talked during class. I thought it is funny that hotels is Disney Resorts Japan announced that they will permit gay marriage at their hotel, right after the day Obama announced that he supports gay marriage. Though they say it was just a coincidence."
NBE00352,"This person has a same thoughts as mine and I liked the phrase ""It is free to love whoever. """
NBE02816,"I hadn't known a gay marriage is prohibited in America, so I was really surprised when I read this article for the first time. I agree with Obama's opinions because the number of people who love same sexual people is more and more increasing recently. This problem is not familiar to us Japanese, but we have to think seriously about this because this is a matter of human right. It is very difficult to conclude this problem, but I wish gay people could express their love freely someday."
NBE07295,"I agree with President Obama's idea that same-sex couples should be able to wed. We can't have right to deprive them of their happiness. Banning gay marriage leads to discrimination, which will violate human rights. It's sacrosanct in nature. We, our society, should admit diversity of values. As the Japanese proverb ""so many men, so many minds"" show, I believe there is no officially decided way to love others."
NBE06659,"It's very difficult problem to solve in Japan, but I think same-sex couples should be able to get married, or we should establish a alternative system like a marriage. For example, a same-sex couple held a wedding ceremony at Tokyo Disney Resort. It's symbolic event. Marriage between people of the same gender or civil union win public recognition gradually. So we should have interest in this problem and protect their legitimate rights."
NBE05620,"The idea that they're admitted to be equivalent to marriage and they can receive a certificate was approved at Shibuya last month. We can think about sexual minority's rights better to hear this news. But there're still many people thinking badly against them. So I think that we should solve this problem gradually, not radically."
NBE06922,I agree with you.
NBE05993,"Gay marriage should be accept in Japan. There is no problem about it, but maybe not easy to ching some low. Because there is few people who against same-sex couple."
NBE06132,"I think the activities of President Obama should be evaluated. Some people support same-sex marriage, some people oppose gay it. So, opposition to same-sex marriage is it that there is no way. However, if anyone does not act just because there is a dissenting opinion, the situation does not change anything. I think attitude to tackle actively the issue of same-sex marriage of President Obama is marvelous."
NBE06133,"I totally agree with your opinion. In the current Japan, understanding of same-sex couples have been gradually spread, I feel. The same-sex couples will be able to get married, but there will be a variety of disorders, such as legislation and institutional reform. However, I think that same-sex couples will be able in the future to be sure to get married."
NBE06273,"Marrying same sex people may be strange. I don't understand this feeling, but I can accept it willingly, because there are many people all over the world."
NBE07326,Reading this article in this timing is kind of interesting because same-sex marriage has been finally legalized in the United States recently. I do not understand why there are opposing people though after reading this article and comment of a former governor. I think the law will just give people more choices or options and so I do not think other people cannot take their rights away.
NBE06026,"I think this problem is very difficult. Now, not all people accept this, same-sex couple marriage. So even if the government allows this, those who are around them may speak ill of them or avoid them as so on. So, many people should know more about them."
NBE05419,"In those days, the bill that the same-sex marriage is allowed in all the continent was passed in America. I think that this is very important thing for the world view of gay or lesbian. But, I also worry that people's view for them is more severe."
NBE05325,I think same sex marriage should be legal. And I should admit this issue. Same sex to give up get marry because it was illegal. But I think this idea is so bud. Couple is couple. I should be allied with love person. I think that it is include in a right of the freedom to recognize this.
NBE05113,"I agree with you. These days, I hear the news about same sax marriage on TV or newspaper so often. I hope all the people live together even if they are same sex couple or not."
NBE02159,"I think that same-sex couples should be able to marriage. Because there is no reason can ban them. The ritual was just decided by people's prejudice. The low should be changed. Surely, in recent years, more and more countries had allowed same-sex couples wed. It is need to popularize this idea."
NBE01718,"Same-sex marriage have been regarded as taboo in many country. But some people suffer between their disposition and the custom. I think breaking the past custom and acknowledging such taboo is the best way to make the world of freedom. So, I agree with the plan and this news. I hope the world to promote such decisions which break the past custom. In the US , more than half population seem to be active for the motion. I expect to see the world's development like this."
NBE01361,"I support a thought of President Obama . The reason is that all people should be free and equal unless they are against the public welfare . Because it becomes natural to marry the opposite sex, some people feel same-sex marriage is strange but, same-sex marriage in itself does not have the problem. And, I think banning same-sex marriage means paying no attention to the minority. From the above, I think that same-sex marriage should be accepted."
NBE02817,"Same-sex marriage have been considered a symbol of taboo in many countrys. But, I support gay marriage. Because I think we must recognize each other's differences for respect of human rights. We should promote the legalization of gay marriage. I believe this attempt lead to eliminate discrimination. Love is celestial things. We mustn't be allowed every discrimination."
NBE02829,"I cannot understand people who oppose to be married in same-sex . At birth, we can not choose the sex of their. This is due to the way, but I don't think this is a reason to deny homosexual. So, I am in favor of same-sex marriage."
NBE02824,"I have never met gays, so I don't know how they are thinking about marriage. In the US, gay marriage is one of the major issues, but it doesn't seem to be discussed in Japan. Therefore I have little information about the issue. I support gay marriage now because they love each other as well as straight marriage. However actually I think I have to make a decision after I know the issue more."
NBE02825,"Although some people oppose to same-sex marriage, I am for President Obama's views. To begin with, as long as there is a society, sexual minorities exist. There is no reason to discriminate them. And it is now an international age, when we humans share the concept of human rights, an universal point of view. So, I think that discrimination against sexual minorities is completely out of date. And I hope it will cease to exist."
NBE02822,"I agree with Mr Obama. I think same-sex couples should be able to marry too. We can't choose own sex freely before we are born. In other words, there are many people who are distressed at own sex. I think we have the right to love freely and choose marriage partner freely. Now, in a lot of country including Japan, gay marriage is not accepted . I hope that this news is a start for changing the bias against gay marriage."
NBE02828,"I think that same-sex couple should be able to marry legally, so I'm in favor of thought of Mr Obama. In Japan, we don't have so many gay people, but when I went to the U. S, I've seen many gay people. If gay people feel happy with the same-sex , I think the law should be change and accept them. All the people should have the right of choice whether marry the same-sex or the opposite-sex. Therefore I believe that same-sex couple should be able to marry legally."
NBE02819,"I think that same-sex marriage shouldn't be approved. It is true that now there is prejudice of same-sex marriage. So it is difficult to prohibit the same-sex marriage, because it will infringe the freedom of the homosexual. However, what kind of feelings will I have when I suppose that my relative is a homosexual? Probably the relative will be prejudiced against by the world, and I may not overlook it. So, I don't agree with Obama's thinking."
NBE02826,"I'm for permitting homosexuals getting married. So I'm glad to hear this news. It brings huge influences to our view about homosexuality. According to it, some still oppose gay marriage. In the situation, Mr Obama said same-sex couples should be able to marry as US president. At first, I didn't know why he made such a remark because he might lose his supporters by it. And I guess it's because he could understand a kind of discrimination they suffered, because he also suffered racial discrimination. Like him, we should be fair to anyone who are homosexuals or not."
NBE02818,"I agree with same-sex marriage, because, in general, for many people marriage is one of the happiest events. However, men have to get married to women;the reverse is also true. if gays are not permitted to get married , gays have to give up the big life event due to ""same sex"". Like this article say ""poll suggested that 50% of Americans were in favor of legalizing gay marriage"", to some extent, gay marriage is far from wholly accepting in society. So I think how Obama's opinion will give impact to society is worth paying close attention to."
NBE02823,"When i read this article, I think that same-sex couples's marriage should be allowed. The reason is that all people should be free and equal unless they are against the public welfare . I have never met gays, so I don't know how they are thinking about marriage, but they love each other . love is free. so they should be allowed."
NBE02821,"I cannot understand people who oppose to be married in same-sex. At birth, we can not choose the sex of their. Of course, I don't have a biased toward homosexual. It is free whoever be loved."
NBE02827,I agree with the opinion that same-sex marriage is acceptable because right of freedom which every people have is the thing that everyone can't violates. It is natural that everyone has each liking and it is acceptable . Same-sex marriage represents the right of freedom.
NBE02820,I approve of his statement because I think human write should be protected and love is the most important thing.
NBE06955,"I have homosexual friends. They always confidently, and I respect them. I think even if homosexual people increase, only diversification of love happens, and it is not a bad thing. So people who oppose homosexuality shouldn't criticize them without throwing their prejudice away."
NBE06871,"I agree with you. Recently, some people confess being sexual minorities. In fact, my classmate in high school is sexual minority, but he doesn't hide this truth. I think the number of people who have a prejudice against sexual minorities is decreasing now, however, changing our view isn't enough. We have to change the law. As you said, discrimination against sexual minorities is out of date. We should change the system to change the world."
NBE06660,"I think same-sex couples should be able to wed. Although they are minority, they don't give trouble to society. Marriage is a basic right. Their right of marriage should be protected. They can have right and become happy."
NBE05298,"I think every person have a right to love someone and marry with her or him. If the partner is same sex, that is so. We cannot decide which sex's person, so that same-sex marriage must not to be abandoned."
NBE05297,I support your idea. We should get rid of all kind of discriminations around us. It is high time we accept the variety of differences between all humans.
NBE06318,"I think that the same sex couple can get married. Only different sex, Why they cannot get married! Based on equality system, the same sex couple can do."
NBE06319,"We should recognize each other. First time, the same sex couple can get married, we normal sexual orientation recognize them."
NBE00355,"When I heard this news first time, I thought I had heard similar news. I felt this is one of problem with death penalty. Death Penalty should be punishment toward crime, but criminal use this act to suicide. I think it's ridiculous, and felt same as Governor, but at the same time, It's not good idea to state that suspect should kill himself from where Governor stand."
NBE00361,"Having read this story, I thought the suspect was very stupid, but the Osaka governor is saying too much that the suspect should've killed himself. Instead, I wanted him to mention the after care system of the prisoner was not prepared properly at least."
NBE00364,"He wanted to die because he has no job and home, however, I heard he would got a job from his friend in Osaka. That is why he went to Osaka. He stayed one night at his friend's house, and he disappeared next morning. He committed crime to be killed himself, however, there is no reason to die because he would had a job later. Moreover, he didn't make any effort to alive positively. I hate the person like him, because there are many people who want to alive more such as patients, poor people and so on. He should try to live strongly. I expert that he shouldn't be killed because his request is DEATH. To punish him, he should stay alive at prison forever, and I believe this is the biggest punishment for him."
NBE00367,"At first, I got angry when i heard this news. It was so reckless and selfish of the suspect to kill others in the intension of being sentenced to death. But now thinking again, other than a individual problem, there seems to be other factors such as economic recession or high suicide rate. And I guess the lack of rehabilitation in prison and economic recession are much to do with this case. As he said, he wanted to die for the reason that he had no home and no job prospects. If the economy is better, the situation may be better. And he committed a serious crime only after ten weeks he was released from prison. It seems that the prison was not able to rehabilitate him fully. In conclusion, this affair result from both a individual problem and a social problem. Anyway, we must not admit such behavior and make effort to prevent it."
NBE00370,"We cannot say anybody should die even if he/she want to die, but in this case, I cannot help thinking that Isohi should have died before involving unrelated two people. Homicide is much more worse than suicide. It must not be condoned that the futures of innocent people are destroyed by others' selfishness. If the life situation of Isohi's was true, public welfare should be strengthened as well for people like him. According to an article which read later, however, he might not intend to die by using death penalty system. So the words that he chose his victims at random and that he wanted to kill anyone so he would be sentenced to death might be a big lie. Anyway, he is a murder. He should take proper punishment."
NBE00373,"It is anger to have felt, when I heard this news for the first time. I feel anger in the surrounding human being who was not able to help two human beings as this Isohi. It got to know that investigated this news by oneself and some witnesses were taking a picture of video. When this was heard , I felt it deplorable. I think it required to help each other all together more at the time of an emergency. And this suspect, s action is it being unusual and not allowed. Therefore the right severe punishment is required."
NBE00376,"After I read news, I was unable to repress my indignation. I concern with the families and friends of two victims. They lost precious one in an instant. I cannot even imagine their feeling. They should hope death penalty for the suspect, Kyozo Isohi. I guess that if the companions of my student union or someone I love are killed by strangers, I will desire to take revenge. This way to think is very natural for all human beings. However, we should not take these feelings too much. When the punishment is determined, we must take an objective view. And I am against ID12063. Suicide is a kind of homicide. In other words, Suicide is equal to homicide. Of course, I do not forgive Isohi's crime. In order to not force those who suffer extreme poverty to kill themselves or want to die, the social security system should be prepared. Recently I heard that some people abuse this system. Needless to say, they quit their evildoing. I expect that the government revise the system or law immediately."
NBE00379,"When I heard this news for the first time, I thought that a murder case happened again. I understood that it was indiscreet thought not to believe it in an unusual case. Then I considered that a man who believes that a case of murder is not unusual was unusual: strange!! Therefore I felt myself scary. However, I cannot understand what he thought, and I think that he should have killed himself, same as Ichiro Matsui. Broadcasting this news to the whole world, I don't want other countries to think that Japanese are dangerous."
NBE00382,"When I heard this news, I was shocked. And, I was so angry. The murder had to kill oneself. I against the death penalty. When I was in primary school, the same murder case broke at Osaka. The man kills children in hope of the death penalty. We have to abolish death penalty to prevent such a terrible case."
NBE00386,"I remember street indiscriminate murder a few years ago in Akihabara when I heard this news for the first time. But I think this case's particular point is that the suspect somehow wanted to die and chose not to kill himself but to stab someone to be sentenced to death. If there were no system of capital punishment in Japan, such case could not take place. So I suggest that Japan abolish this penalty and adopt stricter life sentence. I think unlimited life in prison is more painful and hard than the death penalty personally."
NBE00389,"After watching and reading this news, I thought that if he had wanted to die, he should have died by himself, not involving the other people. It is no excuse of killing the other people that he would like to die. I understand that we can not say you should die if you want to die, but I can say you can not take someone's life in any situation. It might be difficult for him to think about the lives of the persons who were killed, but I wanted him to think about that because they had a family, friends. . . They had their lives."
NBE00392,"I felt how fiendish the suspect was, when I read this article. He might have a lot of distress, but there was no reason why he could kill other people. We must not take others' lives whatever emotion we have. Maybe Osaka Gov Ichiro Matsui would represent the feelings of victims and their families."
NBE00395,"I felt the same way as the Osaka governor say. Thinking of the victim's feeling, it is beyond description. I think that the reason of this case happened is that because Japan's punishment are not heavy enough. We need to take the victim's feeling ."
NBE00397,"After reading this news, I thought that it is an only problem about his humanities. It is not nation's problem. He should not kill people and he should live himself. Suicide rate and death penalty didn't cause this tragedy. He presumed nation(Japan) . I think I said terrible and unholy opinion, but still he should live himself and shouldn't kill others."
NBE00399,"The suspect said that he was frustrated at having no home and no job. I think if he had them, he didn't commit such a crime. Needless to say, the most fact of this crime is his stupid thinking. But it is also one of fact that support for him (he has criminal record) was lacking. This is social problem, and we have to consider ""support for a person with a criminal record""."
NBE00401,"After reading this news, I thought we should rethink about our death penalty system. This case happened because Japan have death penalty to person who kill other people. and as Kyozo said he was frustrated at having no home and no job after he was released from prison, so we also should think about how to do with the criminal after he/she is release. Therefore, I think this case represents a problem in society and we need to think about carefully more to make better future life."
NBE00403,"After I read this news, I thought there were big problem in Japanese criminal system. I suspect that Japanese criminal system is used badly by criminal. In addition to this case , similar cases occurred in Japan. For instance the people who want to live without working do criminal act for food and shelter in jail. They intentionally do criminal act to get food and shelter in jail. They want to be sent to jail!! I think that Japan criminal system should be rethought deeply from this news"
NBE00405,"It was unbelievable that the suspect killed in a knife attack at random to want to die. I want him not to roll up many people only for his circumstances. In addition, it is problem to have one of the world's highest suicide rates."
NBE00407,"When I read this news, I felt the suspect was very selfish. I think Japan shouldn't abolish the death penalty. The most important purpose of prisons is to do the rehabilitation of offenders. But, there are some prisoners who don't want to return to society like this time. Prisons are managed by tax. It is ridiculous that tax are used such people. So, I think Japan continue the death penalty."
NBE00409,"I think this accident reflects Japanese social problems. Now in Japan, poverty and suicide become serious. We have to try to solve these problems. Then this accident presents us about the death penalty, too. Now that Japan is a minority in that it still has system of death penalty despite it's developed country. I think we abolish the death penalty. Because we are a human, and human can make a mistake. So we shouldn't decide other people's life."
NBE00411,"This news made me feel angry. Surely, his life was under difficult condition. However, there was no reason why he was allowed to kill others. His reason is absurd. And this affair includes problems of not only his individual but also Japan's society, that is to say the business climate and death penalty. These problem should be thought out in near future. In this view, this news gave us something important."
NBE00413,"I became really sad at time when I knew this news. This is because two totally innocent people have died. The criminal seemed to want to die, but I roll up an innocent person and am absolutely wrong. I want to have a criminal compensate for a crime reflectively well. I want to warn a slasher from now on recently because slashers increase. An innocent person must be never sacrificed anymore."
NBE00415,"I think this murder reflects the present situation in Japanese. For example, many of Japanese people lose their work and can't find their stable jobs and they lose their hope for living. If the current situation such as the economy, doesn't improve, such a sad news as this will not decrease."
NBE00417,"This incident became a huge problem in Japan because the suspect killed 2 innocent people in order to kill himself. After he released from the prison, he didn't have money, house and family. This was caused by bad Japanese economic situation. Many people lost their jobs and families and they lost their ways of life. Japanese government should think about its economy in order to save our lives. I hope that this accident gave us a good opportunity to think about our lives and economy."
NBE00419,"We have to think this news from many perspectives. First, a point of view of the victims and their families, relatives or friends. Considering from the victims side, we cannot imagine how much sad and disconsolate they felt. The two important and innocent life was lost without a notice. The suspect, Kyozo Isohi, has ruined the life of not only those who have killed but also of the people closely related them. He made light of life. He should have deeply engraved on how important one's life is and there is nothing that can exchange with life. Second, the viewpoint of the people close to the suspect. He should have took into consideration of his family as well. What kind of feeling does his family have after they were informed of this matter? There is no phrase that can substitute for expressing their feeling. Third, the perspective of the suspect himself. Why did he have to take other people's lives? Why he wanted to die? Weren't there any way to stop this sad incident from happening from the beginning? He should have the retribution for what he have done, but is that enough? We cannot think this matter as an irrelevant matter to our life. We can say that this is only one of the result of the problems we have in our society. If we consider this matter as unrelated to our life and just hate the murder and sympathize with the victim, this kind of tragic incident will surely happen again. The next may be your family or yourself. No one knows. So what I wanted to say is that there is no doubt that what Kyozo Isohi had made an irreparable mistake by depriving two people's lives and he should retribute to his deeds, but it is important to think this matter as a social problem and take some action to improve our society and decrease these kinds of tragic."
NBE00421,"I felt that the suspect, Kyozo Isohi was very selfish when I read this sentence. Since he did not have hopes to live anymore, he killed two men at random. The families of the victims will keep to envy him. If he wanted to suicide in fact, I think that he should not kill pedestrians, but kill himself. After all, I do not agree with death penalty. Because it is necessary for you to atone for your sin. I think that Isohi will need to apologize to the families of the victims for killing, atone for his sin."
NBE00424,"I was really shocked to hear the news. As Japan is thought to be one of the safest country in the world, that kind of accident should not be occurred. Also, I think the suspect is really selfish and what he had done cannot be justified. No one has a right to kill some one except for the execution, I believe."
NBE00426,"I was really shocked to hear the news. Though Japan is thought to be the safest country in the world, a terrible trouble is likely to happen. I think no one has a right to kill for the sake of oneself."
NBE00428,"I was really shocked to hear the news. Though Japan is thought to be the safest country in the world, a terrible trouble is likely to happen. I think no one has a right to kill for the sake of oneself."
NBE00430,"After I read this article, I think about the death penalty again. Should Japan continue to have the death penalty?This problem have been controversial for a long time in Japan. Even if the man kill other people, does the country have rights to decide whether the man should live or not?Some people say that the death penalty make the numbers of the crime less because people are afraid of the penalty. But I think this affect of the penalty is questionable after we know the story like this article. We should think about the meaning of the penalty again."
NBE00432,"I can't understand his thought that he killed the persons in hope of death penalty, but I think we don't have to give him death penalty . . . . because he would like to die. So, it is not punishment for him. If he died, he wouldn't sad. It would make him be happy. However, there are many complex feeling of families and friends of the victims . . . so, which would be better , this is very difficult judgment."
NBE00434,"When I read this article, I thought that Japan should reconsider a capital punishment once again. The capital punishment is a thing intended to prevent a crime, but a crime does not seem to decrease to me because there is a capital punishment. There is the risk to bring the opposite effect like this case. I think that not carrying the death penalty but the criminal assumes one's crime and lives ."
NBE00436,"I think the suspect is very selfish. He killed two innocent people so that he wanted to be sentenced to death. I was scared to hear this news, because the news made me to think it is unpredicted when I was killed by a stranger, walking along the street. However, According to the news, he was set free from prison in Niigata two weeks ago. we have to take into account the fact that after released from prison, the criminal did not have home and job prospect, so he wanted to live no more. I doubt the support system for prisoners after they are released from prison properly works."
NBE00438,"As this article said, this case is related to height of committing suicide rate in Japan and death penalty. First of all, the proportion of committing suicide in Japan is very high. According to the graph which we saw in the class, the suicide rate in Japan is 20% and Japan is lying in third place. Also most of developed countries abolished death penalty, but Japan is carrying out execution. This peculiar circumstance will give rise to the case. Of course, I think that it is cruel case and I feel sorry that two people are killed by Kyozo Isohi suspect. But more important thing is that there may be people who have the same idea as Kyozo Isohi, who want to commit suicide but cannot do that by himself so wish to face the death penalty by killing someone indiscriminately. We will have to think about declining the number of such people."
NBE00440,"There are mainly two problems about this matter. First, this case brought the point at issue of the death penalty system to light. That is, the death penalty can be seen as aiding and abetting a suicide legitimately. Personally, I think the death penalty should not be banned. But we cannot ignore this problem. So I think capital punishment needs to be reconsidered. Second, we can see the problem about a repeat offense. I think this is not personal, but social issue . I think all the criminals must be rehabilitated appropriately. Education and full support are necessary for them . Sometimes we regard criminals as dangerous and despise them. But another tragedy may happen if we alienate them from society."
NBE00442,"This article made me sad. Why the victim was killed?Nothing. These days a case of murder like this is more increasing than before. A generation ago, reason for murder is resentment or malice. This is changing."
NBE00444,"I can't understand this murder's feelings. What is that he killed innocent two peoples because he wanted to be executed? Then why did not he kill himself? Certainly, he was frustrated by having no jobs and house. This is the very problem of current society. But I can't forgive him. However he was pained, nothing allow him to kill someone, not to mention of innocent people."
NBE00446,"After I heard this news, I was getting scary . Because he killed innocent people nothing related with him. He was frustrating by having no job and no place to live. I guess there are some people in this world have same problem so he should have tried something or ask somebody to help."
NBE02354,"I'm strongly agree with this comment because I do feel that it's very selfish to murder someone only to get Death Penalty because he can't do it by himself. In the first place, Death Penalty is designed to prevent such a crime. Also, he mentioned that this is not only personal problem, but social problem as well. Suspect wanted to die because he had no job and home. Even though he would had job through his friend later, if society had offer him a home and job after he was released from prison, maybe he would have not done such a thing. """
NBE00448,"After I read this story, I thought that the suspect was a very selfish person. Just because he wanted to be killed, he killed two person that had nothing to do with him and this can not be forgiven. He wanted to die but he couldn't kill himself. He wasn't brave enough to kill himself so he asked for a help to die. I understand his feeling but it is not a thing that could be overlooked."
NBE00450,"I felt very sad when I first read that two innocent people were killed and then it made me angry as I understood the reason of the crime. It was unbelievable that the suspect murdered the victims just because he wanted to die. I usually do not understand or agree with committing a suicide, but for this case, I strongly think that he should have done so rather than killing someone he does not even know. Also, it is important that he should not be given a death penalty which he wished but life sentence instead."
NBE05093,I had a same feeling with him and was surprised with his comment.
NBE02831,I disagree because he thinks of suicide different from homicide. These are same essentially. It does not matter whether object to kill is others or oneself.
NBE00687,I was shocked when I heard this crazy news. I think that Japan is a safe country. But Japan is not a safe country any more. I can not imagine there is a person who want to be sentenced to die. This is a last thought which human have. Japan should be more good place for everyone.
NBE00689,"This news is very terrible, because the suspect killed two people to be sentenced to death. We can say that capital punishment caused this accident. I think it is necessary for the people who are released from the prison to offer the opportunities to rehabilitate. Japan has to reconsider capital punishment."
NBE00691,"It is too selfish to kill people just because he would like to face the death penalty. I can understand a governor's anger well. It will be one method to abolish the death penalty if it does not become a criminal deterrent. Since we are the students of the faculty of law, we have to consider capital punishment carefully."
NBE00693,"what an awful news! This is my first thought when I read this article. I don't understand why this suspect killed other people to ""die"". Maybe he was too weak to kill himself, but I can't forgive him so easily. I feel so sorry for the victims, and the families of them. . . . Wish these kind of affairs never happen again. To make it possible, we have to check whether death penalty is really appropriate or not."
NBE00695,"I disagree with the death penalty in three ways. Firstly, in history, there are many examples when the death penalty was abused politically. Governments can use the death penalty to announce their political will. Especially, governments execute those people who oppose the power of the government. In this case, freedom of people will decrease, and there will be an inflexible atmosphere, causing people to follow the rules of the government. Powerful governments can govern people in this way. It is more obvious if the government is a dictatorial government. They allow executions to eliminate an opposing party. For example, Iran executed a lot of people after 2009 by their ''show trials' because they wanted to repress their power after the blowing up of 2009. Secondly, death penalty is not effective at all. According to Roger Hood, The Death Penalty: A World-wide Perspective, Oxford, Clarendon Press, third edition, 2002, p. 214, Recent crime figures from abolitionist countries fail to 'show that abolition has harmful effects. In Canada, for example, the homicide rate per 100, 000 population fell from a peak of 3.09 in 1975, the year before the abolition of the death penalty for murder, to 2.41 in 1980, and since then it has declined even further. In 2003, 27 years after abolition, the homicide rate was 1.73 per 100, 000 population, 44 per cent lower than in 1975, which was the lowest rate in three decades. Although this increased to 2.0 in 2005, it remains over one-third lower than when the death penalty was abolished. Thirdly, the goal of punishment should be to correct convicts and help them return to society. It is stipulated in the international Covenants on Civil and Political Rights (1966) which states the basic guarantee of human rights in international society. Execution of death penalty is banned with this idea and the execution of the death penalty takes away the chance for convicts to regret their crime and apologize to victim. These are the reasons as to why I disagree with death penalty."
NBE00697,"I don't understand his thought that he killed other person in hope of death penalty. the form of punishment should be reconsidered. Moreover, this news makes us think about death penalty. Is killing really suitable for penalty?"
NBE00699,"After I was read this article, I felt intense anger. Furthermore, I was heard that he had killed indiscriminately, I was so beside myself with anger. He absolutely should be the death penalty. I don't want such a case happening again."
NBE00701,"In my opinion, there should be death penalty because one should get what he/she deserves. On the other hand, we may have to think that there are some people who regards the punishment only as a means of suicide to escape from the reality. In that case, it's hard to say that the penalty works essentially. However, even if there would be alternative capital penalty, some people will also commit crimes in hope of getting the penalty to escape from hopeless ordinary lives. So, there aren't necessity to abolish death penalty. Bearing responsibility for what oneself does is quite important."
NBE00703,"When I heard this news, I feel so sad and angry. Everyone must not kill people and take their lives. We have to think about the importance and value lives. Nothing can take the place of life. I have doubts about police why they released the suspect from prison. I think they should see through his mind and get a thorough going over his release. I wish crimes like this news will not happen."
NBE00705,"When I heard this news, I was very sad. Because the crime was took place in Osaka. And I think about the Death Penalty. I think the death penalty is abolished. The reason why I think so is people who exploit for themselves increase. So I think the death penalty should be abolished."
NBE00707,This is very sad news. It must not be accepted that a man who wants to be sentenced to death kills many innocent and irrelevant people. He must be sentenced to death although he has wanted to be.
NBE00709,"When I first heard this news, it reminded me of the tragedy in Akihabara and I was really terrified. I can't believe why he did such a fierce murder. And then, I thought it is not a problem caused by a death-penalty, but just a personal problem. He said he had nowhere to live, no way to work, but it's because of his behavior. It's nothing but pretext!"
NBE00711,"I think it is too selfish. If I think I want to die, I kill myself alone. The people whom he killed didn't do bad things, there no reasons they should die. If I was their relative, I want to kill the man who killed my important person for his selfish person. Japan thinks death penalty makes people not to commit crimes, but there are people who hope death penalty like this case, it is not good to continue this rule I think."
NBE00713,"The suspect killed people in hope of the death penalty, so this case shows that the death penalty do not necessarily works as prevention against crime. The death penalty have many problem, so it should be abolished. Considering cases like this, its function as deterrent is questionable, and if the case were a false charge, there would be no mending. By the way, I wonder why no one tried to save the victims. The article says that the victims were stabbed again and again, so this means that other people at the scene of crime stood still seeing the tragedy while the crime was committed."
NBE00746,"I agree with the above comment. I didn't think about a tax. Obviously, our tax is spent by a lot of prisoners. Therefore, if there are getting fewer prisoners in Japan, it could use it better for our country. This is not the only reason not to abolish a death penalty, but this is the one of the big reasons not to abolish it. In addition, I agree with ""The most important purpose of prisoners is to do the rehabilitation of offenders"". For example, if a man committed a little crime, punishing it too severely would be not a correct punishment. As the Japanese law also said that some criminals must serve a prison because of protecting the nation and rebirth of them. Therefore, prisoners are believed in rebirth in a sense. However, this case is too cruel, so I should punish him a death penalty. This is why I agree with his comment."
NBE00738,I think a murder is terrible.
NBE00750,"I have heard that your killing yourself is murder. Your life and my life are equal and both of them shouldn't disappear. In this case, of course I can't say if you think die, you should die alone. But if he die himself, only one life disappear. However he killed two people to his death penalty. It's very wrong. There are no lives here, but two lives disappeared to kill oneself. I want him to pay with his life without his death."
NBE00742,"It was unbelievable that the suspect killed in a knife attack at random to want to die. I want him not to roll up many people only for his circumstances. In addition, it is problem to have one of the world's highest suicide rates."
NBE00734,"I disagree this comment. Because I think the suspect struggled for living. It is easy to say he did not struggled for living. That he killed innocent people is not allowable. But his thought to death is not natural. needless to say, he is guilty. But he have some pitiable aspect. So I cannot agree such as violent comment."
NBE00748,"I sympathized with his view about victim feeling, feeling of suspect, thinking that this case is social problem. Especially about thinking that this case is social problem, I think that we should more deeply consider reducing such a case."
NBE01952,"This murder killed two innocent people, wanting to be death punished. Then I thought he should kill himself, as the governor said. But from social position of this governor, he should not have said such thing. So I agree with this comment."
NBE00755,"I agree with the death penalty. If the death penalty abolish, I guess second offense rate will raise. But, in actual, there is a man who kills people in hope of the death penalty like this news. I think this causes are his personality and the society. So, we have to think measures. And, I hope the realization of the society where people who are innocent don't kill."
NBE00736,"I disagree to this comment. Because even if the person wants to die, the person can't kills himself. I think the suspect should realize valuables of the person's life. So I think he should not kill himself."
NBE00737,The reason why I choose this comment is because I think we should reconsider about the death penalty.
NBE00747,"I agree with this opinion, because I think Japanese criminal system should be rethought and the death penalty should be abolished."
NBE00758,I think assailant is self-centered. I can't forgive him.
NBE00759,I think the news is very scary. I favor the death penalty.
NBE00757,"I'm against this comment because even if there weren't death penalty, so far as there are capital punishment or even the fact that there are punishment, there won't be any expectation of no crimes. It's because criminals commit crimes according to the same logic. It is more important to improve social welfare than abolish death penalty. Then, social ills will gradually removed, @@@think."
NBE00732,"I thought that topic is similar to Akihabara's murder case. But I didn't recall it at first, so this comment say what I wanted to say. And the content is good. death penalty is not extreme one. For those who wanna die, penalty's effect is very little. More strict one must be adopt to suspect."
NBE00735,I agree with his opinion. I also think that this man who killed two people are very selfish. Just selfish. What he had done can not be justified. What he did was so bad.
NBE01782,"I also think that there is no reason why the suspect kills two people. He is very self-centered, and it is no longer the problem if he is so or not. It is unbelievable. I wanted him to reconsider before the accident."
NBE01537,I disagree with him. I think that a crime does not seem to decrease to me because there is a capital punishment.
NBE00715,"I was sad for hearing this news. However, the country has also responsibility. The country have to help a criminal who are released."
NBE00749,"I agree this opinion. Of course death penalty is the big problem for us, but the man must not kill the people. My strongly agreeing point of her opinion is that she thinks about victims and their families. They aren't related him and his situation. I think we should not forget victims hearts."
NBE00756,"I agreed with at the beginning of this comment, but I disagreed with at the end. She said that in order to improve Japanese economy, Japanese government should make a new policy of social welfare and encourage young people to work harder. However, I think young people have many pressure and they anxiety about their future and work. Thus, my idea is that Japan should put off maximum age that can work. There are many merits for example, old people know how to work and they know what kind of work they are required by company. So, they can work faster and easier than young people. Japanese companies should use old people effectively and try to make a good economy."
NBE01254,"I heard this news, I don't believe it. The suspect is crazy. I think he should be kill himself."
NBE00744,"I agree this comment because she said we should think about the meaning of death penalty again. In Japan, many people agree with the penalty. But, I have some doubts about this system, too. I think death penalty is not suitable for atone one's sin. I think that Japanese have to think about death penalty more seriously."
NBE00745,"I disagree this comment because he think Japan shouldn't abolish the death penalty. I oppose death penalty. Prisons are surely managed by tax. But, is it most important thing of this problem? I don't think so. I think most important thing is maintain human lights. Even if they are murders, they are human."
NBE00741,"I disagree to this comment. It's because she doesn't consider the families of victim's feelings. Whether the suspect wanted to death or not, the punishment should be determined by fare judgment and the feelings of victim's families."
NBE00743,"The most unfair and terrible death will be the death that killed for no reason. For example, a condemned will not concerned with dying. Since they knows why they are killed. However, reasonless assault for pedestrian will have a terrible stress though they had alive."
NBE00850,"Although he shows his sympathy with the victim's family who may have desire to take revenge, he have an objective opinion about death penalty and social system in Japan. Above all, I strongly agree with his opinion about suicide."
NBE00733,"I also think the suspect is fiendish, and we don't have the right to kill anyone whatever reason we have. We can't understand grief of victims and their families completely, but I can understand that we shouldn't forget how terrible this news was."
NBE00752,"I agree this opinion. This person insist on not having to murder a person even if has anything. I think that, no matter what happens, the innocent person must not murder me either. The criminal should think about the feeling of the family of the victims."
NBE00753,I disagree this opinion. This person objects for a criminal being death penalty. I think that the criminal murdered two innocent people and the criminal should be death penalty.
NBE00739,"Nobody who is living knows how painful he or she die. When I imagine the scene of an execution, I cannot know the condemned criminal's feeling. More Japanese disagree with abolishing death penalty. That is, I think that more the bereaved also do not want to do that. I argue that the heaviest punishment should be decided by not the general but their opinion."
NBE00754,I agree with this comment. Because I think a recession and cold society caused this sad trouble. The root of the problem lies in not only personal issue but also social problem. And social security system is to blame too. The prison is seemed not to play a part.
NBE00751,"These days I hear many times about crime in Japan. I don't know certainly but I think that thing closely relate to early days education. The people who was educated well in elementary school, junior high school and especially in their home, maybe they will not be such a awful person."
NBE00717,"I can't understand why the suspect had to kill people. I strongly agree with Osaka Gov Ichiro Matsui. The suspect of murder was frustrated at having no home and no job prospects, and that he didn't want to live anymore. It really week reason to kill people. I felt anger about it because, suspect could work if he had a energy to killing people."
NBE00719,"I cannot believe the victim that he did such a thing. I cannot understand why some people want to involve other people in their own death such as stopping the train and so. If he/she wants to die, they should without involving other people. I do not think he even has the rights to be sentences to death."
NBE02830,"I disagree with Osaka governor is saying too much that suspect should've killed himself. Because, I think Osaka governor is right to saying that."
NBE02524,I could agree with We need to take the victim's feeling and Japan's punishment are not heavy enough. I think it is ok that suspect killed by prison in this case.
NBE05422,"The person who posted the comment above could not think why the incident is happened deeply. He or she should rethink about the situation of the incident. And he never should say that ""the murder had to kill oneself. "" It is horrible comment. This is why I disagree with this."
NBE05487,"This person had exactly the same opinion. Everybody thought it was the only individual problem, and blamed on what the suspect in the news did. But, the comment above pointed out that there are some other factors related the incidence in this society. What we paid attention were the same, so I agreed with this comment."
NBE00721,"I just can't understand how the victim could do such thing. How could he have a courage to kill someone when he doesn't have a courage to kill him self. Some people say that death penalty should be abolished to eliminate this kind of murder but I think it is not that simple. Because I think by having death penalty, we can avoid bereaved family do such thing as revenge."
NBE05796,I don't think that abolishing death penalty would solve all the problem just like I wrote in my comments. It is not that simple.
NBE00724,"When I heard this news, I was so sad! But I think it's wrong to connect this murder case with the argument that the death penalty should be abolished. I think there are problems about the system of the prison of Japan. It is only several weeks later that he took their lives after he is discharged from prison. I think the prison of Japan don't have the system which let the criminals reflect on their past behavior deeply."
NBE00726,"The problem is very serious. Elderly people want to find a new job now. But they cannot. So, we should give them a chance of re-employment. Concretely, our government must help them to get it. Therefore, the problem of economy will recover."
NBE00363,"I agree with you. I think so, too."
NBE00385,"I'm opposed to your opinion. I think there are more people who do not perform the murder for fear of the death penalty than people who carry out the murder in order to wish the death penalty. So, if the death penalty were abolished, more murders would happen than now."
NBE00423,"Your opinion very is interesting for me. Certainly Kyozo Isohi has to apologize to the families of the victims and be compensated for his sins. I think also that he should do so. However, I wonder families of the victims of this incident think that want Kyozo Isohi to make amends for sins and apologize to them. If my children are killed, I want to put the criminal that killed them to death. Criminal of such violent crime should be the death penalty, or, he or she should atone for sin over a lifetime, it is very difficult for me to determine which is more correct."
NBE00728,"The argument of whether the death penalty should be continued or not has been spotlighted for long time. Some people who are against death penalty claiming that it is too cruel to kill anybody. However, in my opinion, keep living in the jail until you die is much more cruel comparing to just end your life. There will be no motivation to live if you are decided to live until you die in the jail. Spending your life in the jail forever is much more cruel than just kill yourself in my opinion."
NBE00362,"Although this murderer committed a terrible crime, I think we should reconsider about the system of social security such as social welfare benefits. The suspect said he was hopeless because he had no job prospects and home. If Japan's government can provide these to the social disadvantaged, I think the case like this will decrease."
NBE00366,"First of all, I thought the death penalty is it impossible to inhibit crimes by thinking this murder case. In this case, the suspect wanted to be put to death. So I felt we should be continuing to discuss the rights and wrongs about the death penalty. Second, However, I had a question about a remark by Osaka Gov Ichiro Matsui the suspect should have killed himself if he really wanted to die. His remark was honest opinion, but even if he had felt this, he is top of Osaka so anyway, I want him to make efforts not to produce a man like this suspect again. For that, we should think welfare that gets rid of social injustice as much as possible, too."
NBE00369,"When I read this article, I was very sad. Because in this tragedy, victims were chosen at random. The suspect said that he wanted to dead. He was just out of prison. But he couldn't spend decent life. So he committed this crime. I think that not only the suspect but also society should be held responsible for this tragedy. He committed the crime. But we can think that society (prison-aftercare-system)made him commit this crime. So we should change prisoner-aftercare-system."
NBE00357,"I think that this is a very terrible case. I can not understand why he thought to kill a human. However, I can understand the feeling that he was disappointed at because there are not a house and work. In current Japan, it is difficult to get work without a house and to get a house without work. In addition, the evaluation for the person of source is very severe. I think that if we do not correct this system, this case is not solved fundamentally."
NBE06954,To kill myself is very bad attention. Because a lot of people die in spite of they want to die. to kill myself is rude for them They should live for them! There is no life that may be died!
NBE00372,"Although this case is terrifying, I think that the current society system has a problem. The problem is that people who was released from prison have difficulty getting job again. We have to solve it. We have to start lesson in prisons to get job again so that prisoners make it easy after released from prison."
NBE00375,"Reading the article, I really feel sad and angry, because innocent civilians were killed by extremely mean and cruel man. When I was in high school, I often took part in volunteer work to support homeless people in Nishinari District, where is the greatest slum in Japan. During the activity, many of them told me that they had no money, no family and no hope to live. Some even said that he would rather die than live with intolerable and ceaseless agony. In this case, the suspect had the same thought and his sense of hopelessness drove him to the terrible crime. Of course, just because he want to die, it doesn't mean that his murder is justified. He should be to blame for his mad slaughter and he should be executed. (In this point of view, I'm for the death penalty, because some criminals should be punished by death for their brutal crimes, like the suspect) However, before discussing his cold blooded mental, we should focus on what made him a condemned criminal. Perhaps the answer is the society. In order to prevent this terrible tragedy from happening again, I think that all we must do is support poor people."
NBE00378,"It is terrible case. Criminal said he wanted to die and he cause crime to received a death sentence. I can't understand his action, if he wanted to die, he should kill himself not put other man any trouble. For example, stab himself, have sleeping pills a lot, hanging, etc. . . I play for the soul of victim and I wish not to cause these case never."
NBE00381,"This is really terrible case. I'll never understand the suspect who killed two innocent people with selfish motive. Even if the suspect is executed, the bereaved will lifted because it is just his desire. It's difficult problem that the death penalty, a deterrent to crime is grasped just like the way of suicide."
NBE00384,"I got very sad and angry to read this article. Though i sympathize with him because it is hard to have no home and no job, I never accept his cruel action. There is no reason for the two victims to be killed. He should have killed himself."
NBE00358,"I'm not for your opinion. Actually. it is difficult to get work without a house and to get a house without work, but I think it has nothing to do with the case. No matter what happens, all the people must not kill others. In my opinion, one of factors which he committed a crime is that he didn't have close friends. He was sure to be lonely. It is true that correcting current evaluation system is important, but I think we should make strong a connection with each region."
NBE00388,"Why would you kill somebody that is innocent? This is so embarrassing. If he wants to die, just go kill himself as it is said in this article. No one is allowed to kill random people in the street! And why the hell did the police released such a dangerous person, I cannot understand them."
NBE00359,"Well, it is natural for people from the prison not to have work and home sometimes. In this case, he also deserves it. That's not the only reason he was disappointed because it was difficult to get work."
NBE00391,"I remembered the news well because I was very surprised at the statement of arrested man that he chose his victims at random. I could not believe my ears when I heard the news. Much crime occur all over Japan. Especially in Tokyo, I feel many killings related to human relations. Some of the case are at random. Now, I live in Tokyo alone because my hometown is Sendai. When I started living by myself, my parents were worried about my getting caught up in a crime. I often hear such a news, so I will continue to watch out a crime and guard me by myself from now on."
NBE00394,"I can not understand that such murder who killed people indiscriminately commit killing. When I read this article, I was sad. This news happened four years ago. But I remember this case. And I thought ""There was a thing like that. "" But at heart, that case happened four years ago, I did not remember in detail. What is more when I heard this news, I was not a university student and did not belong to faculty of law. Before I study human rights , for example constitution, I agree with the death penalty. But now, I am a university student and besides belong to faculty of law. I study jurisprudence that includes human rights. I disagree with the death penalty. Because trial is sometimes wrong. The judge, too, are people. If an accused who is innocent in fact is sentenced to the death penalty, it is a false accusation. And a person who is innocent is punished by nation. And often said that killers claim life, so they are paid for their own lives. Then why people who wound people shall be punishable to a fine or imprisonment ? If the death penalty adopt punitive justice, for example an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth , people who wound people not punished but wounded. For these reasons, I disagree with the death penalty."
NBE00360,"I don't agree with your opinion. I will state my opinion the following. I will insist two points. One point. People who don't have work may be hard to get a house. And vice verse, people who don't have a house may be hard to get work. Certainly such people are disappointed at every things. While it may be true that they should not do indiscriminate murder. And I think that people who killed other people do not their best. He said that he wanted to commit suicide. Because he give up hope. Just because do not kill innocent people indiscriminately. Two point. I think that nation should put up policy to save such people. And the nation should save such people, too. At first, I will tell you that nation should do. Nation should set up institutions for people who have difficulty in seeing off normal life and set draft budget to use for social policy. What is more , to get money to set up institutions and spend money for social policy, the nation should pay tax. I am studying now constitution, it says principle of equality. So people who spend normal life understand the present circumstance and then pay tax. From the words above, I don't agree with the opinion."
NBE00511,"I thought that it was a dangerous problem, when this news was read. If population decreases as it is and elderly people increase in number, economy will contract. Therefore, the environment where elderly people can do work is required. If elderly people cannot do work, economy will reduce further. it is important to support a young man's child rearing at elderly people working."
NBE00518,"This problem will occur in near future. So it is important to think about it from now. Japan has a lot of debt , so we can't rely on social security. I think making elderly people possible to work for a long period is good idea."
NBE00528,"Aging society is very serious problem in Japanese future. The biggest problem is that the number of people who work what is called working population is decreasing. These days the national economy is unhealthy. Japan is in huge debt. To resolve this problem, working population has to be increased and social security has to be reconsidered. I think it impossible to continue managing pension. Therefore Japanese government should formulate realizable policy of social welfare and should encourage young people to work harder."
NBE00485,"When I knew this news, I thought that this was a serious problem to greatly influence in the future in Japan. Elderly people of Japan increases steadily. In addition, it becomes the low birthrate and aging society because a lot of people who marry after getting old do not make children. Population of Japan decreases steadily as now, and I think that I lose the power as the country. I work hard at the making of child, and it is necessary to attach the power of a young generation."
NBE00513,"When I read this article, I thought that this was a serious problem. When the ratios of elderly person increase in Japan;the nation's economic prospects depend on making them productive. However, actually there are few places where the elderly can work by resignation and so on. I think that the government should think about the making of environment and the pension policy once again because the aged society will worsen more in the future."
NBE00476,"It's a tremendous waste of experience and knowledge. And I've noticed that people tend to age more quickly once they stop working. There's something rejuvenating and therapeutic about being needed and earning a living. I agree with it's thought. Work place is important especially for elderly people in that they can have connections with many people. Retirement causes for some people not only poor but also isolation from society. Now in Japan, the system of social welfare is bankrupted, and the number of elderly people's suicides are increasing. To offer them their jobs may become one solution to solve these problems, I think."
NBE00488,"The environment where elderly people can do work is required. (quotation from comments) I agree with this opinion. Many aged Japanese have more knowledges and experiences than young people, so they can work to support or educate their next generation. In addition, I think people who work for something are very lively, in fact, 80-year-old my grandfather is now worker and live happily. 60 years old is not so weak and old actually. Of course, there are people who don't work anymore over aged 60, I suggest that elderly chose whether they continue to work or not when they become the present retire year. In the future, Japanese security services will be more powerless, so reforming work environment is the best way for nation as one of the developed aging countries."
NBE00466,"I think the cooperation between generations is important to overcome this problem. The current social security system won't be sustainable because the system is based on plentiful young labor force and high economic growth. The number of young people is on the decrease while the number of elderly people who retired from their jobs are on the increase. It's means tax income reduces while the cost of social security increases. What is worse, the long lasting recession has already multiplied the public debt. Japanese government finances is now on the verge of collapse. So it indeed inevitable that the rate of consumption tax is raised and the age when a person can receive a pension is delayed. But I believe we can take other measures in community. Some women are afraid that they have to quit their jobs if they have children and put off starting families even though they want to. Then, some elderly people have much experience of raising children and if they can help the mother bring up their children, more young women feel at ease and decide to have children. And some elderly people want to work but they can't get jobs because they are likely to get sick. Then, if young people do the jobs in place of them, more of them can be employed. In conclusion, young generation and elderly generation need help each other in order to get through this problem."
NBE00491,"I think this problem is caused by long term depression. Young people do not afford to have their children. Even though you blame them for the origin of declining number of children and aging society, I argue that the government failed in stimulative measures is to blame too."
NBE00526,"It is inevitable for all humans to age. An aging society must come to Japan in the future. We have to take measures to deal with the situation. I also agree with ID12028's opinion. Unless the number of children increases suddenly and mysteriously, we need elderly people to work. And, maybe we should consider immigrants for the workforce. For example, some Filipina tried to become nurses in Japan and obtained certification. This is based on EPA between Japan and the Philippines. As a result, they failed and went back to home. The arguments about this issue should be activated. In order to solve the root of this problem, the government needs to enact a law to urge nations to have a baby. I think that the tax deduction for medical expenses is one of the effective measures."
NBE00465,"The environment where elderly people can do work is required. Like ID12028, I agree this opinion. Young people tend to be DINKS these days. So the trend that the number of elderly people increases and the number of people who support elderly people decreases has progressed. Therefore it is important for elderly people to be equipped to live by their own. It may be difficult for elderly people to start new jobs or acquire some techniques, so I think that it is important to prepare a suitable environment that elderly people can continue their jobs and apply what they have experienced."
NBE00521,"I think that this problem will happen. In order to maintain the economy of Japan, Japanese government and laws allow elderly people to work longer if they want to work more. The population of young people in Japan is getting smaller, so the economy would not be supported by young people only. We need to think about this problem seriously."
NBE00477,"I think it's ludicrous to ""force"" people to retire at age 60. In some cases even earlier. Japan seriously needs to rethink this for the future. Adjusting pension benefits based upon age would also be appropriate in my opinion. If someone retires at 60, give them 60% of their benefits, 65, let's say 80% and at 70 everyone gets 100% of their benefits. I disagree with the opinion. Of course, there are even people who are over 60 years old and are able to work. But the Japanese economy is in a recession. Also the rate of employment in Japan has been decreasing for the past several years. So now many young people cannot get a job even if they are graduated from university. But if government adopted this system, more and more people cannot get a job. This is because the number of employment is more decreasing due to older people staying their office. People who are over 60 years old can choose whether they work their office or retire the job and receive a pension. So they have luxury choice. But if young people failed to get a job, they cannot earn a live. most of them will get a part-time job. But their lives are unstable. Moreover, if they have already been graduated from university, they will lose the chance of get a full-fledged employee. Such society is unfair. Therefore, we should turn our attention to the problem of difficulty of getting a job for young people."
NBE00520,"I think government should consider about it more seriously. I think elderly people should have a chance to work if they can because there are a lot of elderly people in Japan and it is increasing every year. If there are more workers, economic would be active because government don't have to pay much for over sixty-year-old people who can earn money to live. Furthermore, I believe some young people should work harder because I heard the NEET population is growing. They rely on their parents. It wouldn't be good. I think that that's one of the reason why they can't get enough money to have a baby."
NBE00525,I think this is very serious problem in Japan. Increasing the percentage of elderly people cause economic stagnation. So government needs to have a solution for that. Japan tend to retire when they got 60 or 65. I think employer needs to hire them only if they still have ability to work.
NBE00533,"I think aging population is a problem we cannot avoid from in nearly future in Japan but because many elder people were keen to work, I think Japan should abolish the retiring age system and change it to open-ended system so many people can work until they are satisfied."
NBE00516,"It's a tremendous waste of experience and knowledge. And I've noticed that people tend to age more quickly once they stop working. There's something rejuvenating and therapeutic about being needed and earning a living. I agree with this opinion. Elderly people retire their job and there is few people who succeed to great technologies that are proud of Japan. Technologies are disappearing little by little, but certainly. That is so regrettable. And retired elderly people who has worked earnestly for a long time become more likely to be Alzheimer by having no reasons for living. I have heard that, and my acquaintances, for example my friends' grandfather and grandmother, was also so. Opportunities to work give elderly people reasons for living."
NBE00474,"I think this is an important problem for Japan's future. It may be easy for companies to employ elder people, because elder people have already had the skills to work. They have experiences and intuitions which can be used in working. However, if companies employ young people, a lot of money would be necessary to educate them. I understand their thought, but it is young people that will support Japan in the future. The skills, experiences, and intuitions have to be conveyed the next ages. To solve this problem, the government should help companies to employ more young people, including us!!"
NBE00468,"The environment where elderly people can do work is required. : I think in the same way. I guess there are a lot of the elderly people who want to come back to jobs but do not have the opportunity. For most part-time jobs, young men is in great demand. I suggest public institutions should voluntary create new employment for the elderly such as a clerk, and a guard in a public facility. My city has ""silver jinzai center"", the main aim of which is that people over 60 years old will register for it, and will be sent to the city's facility as labor force. Until now, I think , it has worked successfully. Therefore, I suppose if more and more public institutes should found their own centers like that, the situation will get improved."
NBE00507,"I think that Japan have to solve the problem. If Japan can solve the problem , Japan may be the leading country. China will be the same situation soon. Japan's model how to solve aging society give any aging society hope."
NBE00523,"I think it is necessary to increase labor force as much as we could. However, I think to hire aging is not a good solution to solve the problem we are facing. I heard at least 1/4 of people who graduate university couldn't get a job. I think it's because aging don't give up their seat. Many workers feel the circumstance that aging occupy their seat, usually those are high rank, is bad for their company. Workers said that they are hard-headed and inflexible. I think it's important to let younger people to get a seat in company, not keep aging who can't get along with company."
NBE00522,"I'm strongly disagree with this comment because I think it's not good idea to let aged people stay in company. I think that is our last choice and I think we have more ways to increase labor force. First of all, there are many younger people who are willing to work. It's important to let them experience how economy goes, because they are people who would support Japan longer than aged people. Let aged people work is good for now, but it cause less chance for younger to have a same experience. If we let aged people work, and when they died, people who are left is not experienced people only. If we really want to let Japan stay longer, than I think we need to let younger to work, than aged people."
NBE00529,I think we have to make more old people to work and earn money by them self and stop them relying on pension. Decreasing numbers of working people can not afford increasing number of old people and we have to change the society to get on with this problem.
NBE00532,"I think that it is a huge serious problem that we all Japanese people should think about and find a strategy. For me, as 20 years old at the moment, I am worried about the incoming future we will be facing. It will be absolutely difficult for us to have such increasing number of elderly. Even though they are putting off their retirement and trying to work longer and remain active, there is a limit. This problem is most likely to affect the economic of the whole country and we are under pressure that we have to support the old people."
NBE00530,"After reading this news, I was very shocked. For solution, I thought that the old people should be easily hired to work if they want. By doing this, there may some benefit. In case working with young people like teenagers, the old people may teach the experience they have got from their long life and stimulate the young people. I do not think this is the problem, but it is a chance to get our age developed."
NBE00519,"I strongly disagree with his opinion especially ""I I heard at least 1/4 of people who graduate university couldn't get a job. I think it's because aging don't give up their seat. Many workers feel the circumstance that aging occupy their seat, usually those are high rank, is bad for their company. "" I think people who graduate university couldn't get a job because they didn't effort enough. I think most young students are lazy during school life. I bet they could do harder if they really want to get a job."
NBE00527,I disagree with this comment. I think that we should not make elderly people possible to work for a long period. There is one reason. Making elderly people possible to work for a long time causes to make short of opportunities of working for young people. So I think that young labor population should be larger.
NBE00503,I think that this situation is very serious problem. Because keeping to increase people aged 65 or over will lead too heavy a burden for young people who are going to work in the future. Such a hard situation may discourage young people from working.
NBE00535,"Thanks to the development of technology, the average lifetime of Japanese has continued to extend. However, most of the elderly people now do not have job because of the retirement. I don't agree with this system. We should not force them to retire depending on decided age, we should allow them to keep working if they are healthy and able to work. Now there are a lot of senile people BECAUSE they do not work and use their brain and once they get senile, it seems to be difficult for them to make it again. In addition, few companies are likely to hire elderly people because elderly people are thought to be short memorized. I know it's very impolite expression but most of the people think like that somewhere in their mind. That's why I think they should continue to work so that they won't get senile. If they don't get senile, they can be very productive using their great knowledge and experience."
NBE00484,"It is not a government job telling people when to retire. It is up to each individual's decision. Japan needs to change it to an ""open end"" retirement like US. We have no mandatory retirement age at 60. Many seniors with special skills are still working and contributing to society. Japan needs to change. I agree with this opinion. Nowadays, people aged 60 or over are still active, and many of them do volunteer work or so energetically. I think that the right time to retire depends on each person. Some of them want to keep on working after they retired. Others think that they want to enjoy the rest of their life. In this way, I think it is not a government job to tell people when to retire."
NBE00458,"Aging society is very serious problem in Japanese future. The biggest problem is that the number of people who work what is called working population is decreasing. These days the national economy is unhealthy. Japan is in huge debt. To resolve this problem, working population has to be increased and social security has to be reconsidered. I think it impossible to continue managing pension. Therefore Japanese government should formulate realizable policy of social welfare and should encourage young people to work harder. I mostly agree with this opinion. al welfare but It's true that Japan is now in a huge debt and there should be some way to solve this problem. Also, I agree with the idea of increasing working population and governments should formulate realizable policy of social welfare but I don't think encouraging young people to word harder will be a good measure. Young workers already have too heavy burden on their back because of our ""pension"" system. I guess another measure that do not force young people to work harder will be needed."
NBE00496,"This is one of the biggest problems in Japan. Because of bad Japanese economy, many young people can't get new jobs, get homes, and have a family. Also they don't try to make their children. This bad economy causes bad results in the future. I think Japanese government should submit the new amendment which can help money for studying or medical treatments for children. This needs much money for government, but this cost will connect with bright future in Japan."
NBE00515,"I think it's ludicrous to ""force"" people to retire at age 60. In some cases even earlier. Japan seriously needs to rethink this for the future. If people want to retire that's one thing, however if they don't, or if they need to keep working then let them do so. I agree with this opinion. I also think it doesn't have to ""force"" people to retire at age 60. It is good thing for the new comers to work with the veteran who have more knowledge or more experiences. And probably, the people who want to continue to work though they are 60 have high motivation. I think it makes companies be better."
NBE00470,"This news is related to us, too. Nowadays, even young people are keen to work, but there are few job opportunities. I don't know what to do for a declining birthrate and aging populations. So I want to do what I must do now."
NBE00453,"This is very big problem in this country. Honestly, I don't know how to deal with this problem. But I guess the way to solve this problem is create jobs the opportunity should be given for elderly person. If they continue to work more 5 years, the situation may be better."
NBE00495,"It is said that Japan will become aging society and declining birth rate. Experts indicate some causes of that. When I read some opinions, I feel that a provision for aging society requires a policy of the government. Japan is a backward country about support for people who does child raising and work. And, Japanese pension plan begins to decline. The government has great power. So, I think the government should do some policies. But, I don't think it is enough. Japanese style of systems won't obtain soon by changes of society. So, Japanese people should seek new systems by learning various countries."
NBE00454,"Aging has been a big problem for a long time in Japan, and it is obvious that we must deal with this matter. If nation's prospects are correct, young people will bear too heavy a burden and aging people won't be able to receive enough pension to live on. But this problem is difficult to solve. I think a solution that is shown in this article is good. But that is not practical because realizing a society where elderly people can work is not easy in this situation. Now, even young people who graduated from university take trouble to get a job. So I think many corporations can't afford to accept elderly people. We may not have the clear solution. But no doubt all of us must share part of the burden in some ways to tackle this difficult problem."
NBE00517,"The article speaks about the shrinking of the labor force. However, I think this kind of problem can be solved with making working place convenient to elderly. I think the most effective way for making the workplace convenient for the elderly is work sharing. According to a business dictionary, work sharing is a Method used for reducing operating costs without laying off employees. In work sharing schemes, working hours and wages are cut across the board until the organization's finances return to normal levels. The company can then work towards employing elderly. In this case, elderly can work more effectively because they can maintain work-life balance. Using this method, the elderly's hope for working can fulfilled. Furthermore, this method is effective for solving problems with low birth rate and so on. Many females put off having babies because of their work. However, with this method, Females can continue working in this style until their babies have grown up enough, and males can help infant care. These are my opinions on elderly society."
NBE00473,"I think, it is so seriously problem for Japan. This article said, many old people want to work. It is same as young people. So many young people want to get job, but there are not plenty of job. People couldn't get job often lost home, some of them starve to death. And, there is a problem of pension. Nowadays, few young people support many old people. This system is on the verge of collapse about to fall apart. If these problems weren't resolved, Japan would collapse ."
NBE00455,I think aging society is the most serious problems in Japan. A few young people must help a lot of old people. This situation must not work any more. So Japan must establish new welfare system. Japan have great deal of debt in the world. Aging society is the reason of Japan's debt. Politicians must be hurry to establish new welfare system.
NBE00479,"Aging society is not avoidable. I think Japan should act for declining birth rate than for aging because we can't control the timing of people's death. So, I think also Japan has many debt and will be bankrupt unless Japanese government manage to declining birth rate."
NBE00497,"The environment where elderly people can do work is required. I agree to this opinion. The reasons are as given below. First, feeling being needed can be what makes life worth living. Second, when a trend towards fewer children, being more workforce is essential to retain at least current economic power. So, I think it important elderly people to have more opportunity to get jobs."
NBE00500,"This news tells us serious problems. We must face them in near feature. Aging society in not avoidable for Japan. So it is very important to think how to deal with it well . At the same time, we should build the society that young people can have baby easier."
NBE00478,"I don't think this news is the problem in the future. we are responsible for this serious problem. We should manage somehow and find a solution of the birth rate declining and the population aging, unemployment problem. Otherwise business activity goes bad and people living in Japan will have difficulty making a living."
NBE00490,"It is not a government job telling people when to retire. It is up to each individual's decision. Japan needs to change it to an open end"" retirement like US. We have no mandatory retirement age at 60. Many seniors with special skills are still working and contributing to society. . Japan needs to change. "" The comment above is from the link to the news story. I agree with the idea that the individual freedom choice of when to retire should be entrusted to oneself. It is true that more Japanese elderly people is eager to work and Japan is in need of more workers. We should also think of people who do not want to work longer. There are some people who want to retire at the age of 60. So the government should stop telling people when to retire and entrust the choice to each individual. From another point of view, it is not always good to elderly people to keep on working especially in the big companies. This is because elderly extension of working will result in less adoption of young people. It is also important to improve the current situation of unemployment. Anyway, ""Elderly to account for 40% of Japanese in 2060"" is imminent issue to Japan, so the Japanese government should try every possible means to stop the society from aging and come up with the idea to increase children."
NBE00459,"I think this fact is very serious problem. Present Japan is aging society, so to increase elderly people is dangerous problem. I think growing the opportunity that aging people get their job should be conducted immediately."
NBE00452,"Before I leave this comment, I read the other comments above. There are many opinion about the retirement age problem. They say that the system should be abolished and the elderly people should work active after 65. The aging people have more capacities for the work than young people, so they can contribute to the society. I agree with these comments. But I think there are something to do before the abolishment is done. If the elderly people continue to work more, some changes in the workplace is required. People will have difficulties about their bodies as they became older and the companies that they work have to have consideration with their problem like this. To stop the retirement age , we should think ""What is needed for the society which the elderly people work comfortably?""."
NBE00502,"Japan is now aging rapidly so it is necessary for the government to deal with the problem. Someone commented on this blog that it is not the government that decides when to retire, partly I agree with the idea, but I also think that it is the necessary thing for the government to decide it as one of the model for the companies. That way, people will realize how to deal with the problem efficiently? The point is, government needs to show us the model."
NBE00493,"I agree with this opinion, but it has a big problem. The problem is that the employment opportunities for young people may be reduced in exchange for the ones for elderly people. Please try to think who will make our future world. Before everything, we should promote the employment for young people, i think."
NBE00501,"I think it is good to raise the age of retirement to 70 or elder. Increase of elder people cannot be stopped any more, so companies should positively employ elder people. Besides, if the number of working elder people increase, income of pension also increases."
NBE00480,"I absolutely agree. It's a tremendous waste of experience and knowledge. And I've noticed that people tend to age more quickly once they stop working. There's something rejuvenating and therapeutic about being needed and earning a living. This is Alan's opinion, I agree with this opinion mainly. Japan has many old people, and it will be kind for them, it is impossible I think. Japanese old people can live and work very long. So in lives, Japanese people should work something."
NBE00486,"I agree the opinion. In Japan, It is self-evident that number of children will decrease and the aged will increase. This is a big problem we and industrialized countries in the world cannot avoid. So, Japan should become a model case."
NBE00508,"I think this problem is complicated. If elderly people can participate in the labor market, they will be great labor force. Actually, In Japan, the system like this were proposed, that often called ""re-employment system"". However, some people point the problem of this system. The problem is that the system will be dangerous to press the employment of young people. So it would not result in success if the retirement age were raised."
NBE00475,"If there are more elder people, it will be more inconvenient. Getting fewer children will be unable to pay an enough tax for elder people. Getting more elder people will be unable to receive an enough pension. Therefore, the nation should improve the welfare. For example, a maternity leave will be installed every company, the government support families which have more than 2 children, it will reduce a cost for schools and so on. I think it is the most important for young families to carry out these systems. In short, I want the government to improve welfare which can be made children without difficulties."
NBE00492,ID12011 can consider this problem objectively and study from another angle. And his view is much to the point! So I strongly agree with his comment.
NBE00460,I am afraid of an aging society.
NBE00469,"This news is related to us, too. Nowadays, even young people are keen to work, but there are few job opportunities. I don't know what to do for a declining birthrate and aging populations. So I want to do what I must do now."
NBE00456,"I agree with this comment. Because I think the corporation is the most important to overcome aging problems. A few years ago, children helped their parents. But, children can not help their parents today. So there are need to rely on the social security. The cost of social security is enormous. So Japan is the country which have a lot of debts. Now that social security system is collapsing. So we have to corporate."
NBE00506,"I disagree with this opinion. This is because this comment say that aging people should work harder. I feel this opinion heartless. There may be another settlement of the aging society. For example, we make Japanese government to receive immigrants more and more. So young foreigner would come Japan and work hard. And They may leave more offspring than Japanese and the percentage of attendance would improve."
NBE00489,"I agree with this opinion. Many aged Japanese have more knowledges and experiences than young people, so they can work to support or educate their next generation. In addition, I think people who work for something are very lively, in fact, 80-year-old my grandfather is now worker and live happily. 60 years old is not so weak and old actually. Of course, there are people who don't work anymore over aged 60, I suggest that elderly chose whether they continue to work or not when they become the present retire year. In the future, Japanese security services will be more powerless, so reforming work environment is the best way for nation as one of the developed aging countries."
NBE00494,"I think it is important to think Japanese future, too. Japan has a lot of problems that we have to solve. Many people in Japan don't expect the government policy any more. So, I think young people should think the future."
NBE00505,Japan should be aging countermeasure. Otherwise Japan collapse in the near future.
NBE00457,"It is amazing news. Too much of elderly people is a serious worry for nations in every respect. Therefore government should search away out of that. In addition, ordinary people, especially young should try to improve that. Otherwise they will be suffered from various problems."
NBE00514,"When I read this article, I thought that this was a serious problem. When the ratios of elderly person increase in Japan;the nation's economic prospects depend on making them productive. However, actually there are few places where the elderly can work by resignation and so on. I think that the government should think about the making of environment and the pension policy once again because the aged society will worsen more in the future."
NBE00504,I agree with this opinion. Because it is true that young people number is decreasing and labor force is shrinking but the number of the elderly will be demanded now and future.
NBE00509,"I agree with this opinion. If those who want to work should just work all the time. Moreover their experience is required for society. Furthermore, a pension is needed when it retires early. It presses the Japanese economy. Therefore, the pension of past 60 years old should also work"
NBE00510,"I dis agree with this comment. Because there is tradition in Japan. When many woman work, housekeeping stops realizing. I think that man and woman, s division of roles that it is the right form of Japan."
NBE00512,"I think if elderly was working at good position, young will not work at good position. So I think elderly retire as soon as possible."
NBE00467,"I agree with him because he consider the social factor in this case. In addition, he analysis the feelings of families of both victim and suspect."
NBE00471,"Actually, elderly people in Japan, much people wants to work with proper pay, they require money which can back up their lives. No matter how many elderly people increase in future life, an amount of payment toward to elderly people will not surpass an amount of production which elderly people make."
NBE00472,"If there a time to grow, there is a time when its decline. I think this process is a part of an earth's self-purification. Because I thought Japan's future is fearful since birth rate has decreasing. Japan Government have to make a method to increase birth rate and increase labor age in the far future."
NBE00463,"The environment where elderly people can do work is required. Like ID12028, I agree this opinion. Young people tend to be DINKS these days. So the trend that the number of elderly people increases and the number of people who support elderly people decreases has progressed. Therefore it is important for elderly people to be equipped to live by their own. It may be difficult for elderly people to start new jobs or acquire some techniques, so I think that it is important to prepare a suitable environment that elderly people can continue their jobs and apply what they have experienced."
NBE00464,I also think that NEET rely on their parents and this situation is bad. We should look at our social system.
NBE00461,"I am afraid about Japanese future. So, I agree with this comment. I also think that Japanese government should formulate realizable policy of social welfare and should encourage young people to work harder."
NBE00462,"In today's Japan we are faced with dual-ongoing problems, the aging society caused by longer life expectancy and lower birth-rate. On top of these problems, we are also in the serious economic recession. I think the fundamental problem is coming from decreasing number of working population. One of the way to cope with this situation, in my idea, is just to make full use of working power by women and the older age. It is important for us to prepare the suitable working condition so that they can work easily and happily. I believe this is one good solution to the problems."
NBE00498,I sympathize because she worry about aging society too. And I think her idea of growing the opportunity that aging people get their job is good idea.
NBE00499,She said it is not good that old people work after retire. However I think it is very effective for Japanese economy. So I disagree with her.
NBE00482,I have the the same opinion about elderly to work.
NBE00483,"I think elderly people have a lot of experience and wisdom, so Japanese society can use their power. At the same time, that is reasonable to Japan's economy. I think they should work if they can."
NBE00487,There is no way other than the plan.
NBE00481,"When I was heard news, I think that it is very seriously problem for Japan for government. I read some opinions, I think that the old man should work. If they are healthy, they don't need to retire their job."
NBE00524,"Having read this article, i worried about Japan's future. Elderly to account for 40% of Japanese in 2060 the article said. Young people including me, of course don't want to pay tax only for elderly. Tax payment will heavily task young people's living due to increasing elderly pension. I want to use my money for myself but I also have to pay tax. So, I should earn lot of money and study how to decrease my tax payment to be happy."
NBE00531,"I do not think we can avoid this problem with aging society and low fertility and if I can come up with a great idea to solve it, I think someone else has probably come up with it. But I do agree to the fact that many people are working for too long and this leads to poor employment rates."
NBE00534,"I think governments and company should support elderly people who wants to work more. My grandmother still works 5 days a week even though she is 74. And because she goes to work she has lots of friends and shares her hobby with them. Compered to her, my grand father quit his job long time ago. He stays at house all day and has no one to talk with. Now he has doubt that he has Alzheimer's disease. I think that if he could keep working more he wouldn't have got disease."
NBE01530,"I don't think we need to be apprehensive that lack of labor force makes Japan fall national power. Because industrial robots will make up lack of labor force. However, it's not mean that we can take a rosy view. Japanese government will not collect a lot of tax. Japan's pension scheme might unravel. I think Japanese government must consider its plans."
NBE05224,"I think this article shows a serious problem in Japan and is related to all of us. The more elderly people are increased, the more responsibilities we must have. Thus, if elderly people want a job, government should help them to seek a job and solve a problem with entire country. This situation will not be changed if there are no help of the government."
NBE05256,"I think this is very serious problem. The number of people aged 65 is increasing these days. So young people has many serious problems about tax and care for the aged. I think a solution to this problems is increase the number of children. To increase it, we should make an environment which easy to give birth. And the government should make a policy. Probably it will take many time. But I think someday the number will increase. I'm worry about Japan's future very much. we should do something to solution this problem."
NBE05163,"I had known that older people in Japan were increasing, but I didn't imagine that it would reach 0.4 in 2060. I think that Japanese government should immediately make a policy which companies must hire motivated older people. Also, it must act for young people. Reducing public debt, they don't need to be afraid of their future and can happily think about having their babies. I hope Japanese economy will recover as soon as possible."
NBE06716,I think this is one of the most important problem in Japan. Aging population and decreasing number of children will cause declining economy power. And young people will have to hold heavy tax for pensions. We should think how we create the society that the aged can keep to work and many families can get some baby. Young people have to save money for life in their old age because they will be able not to receive pensions.
NBE07271,"An aging society is big problem for Japanese society. I think two plans. We have to make our society very convenient for elderly people. And we should conduct the employment adjustment. And I think the Japanese government have to think about accepting immigration. In the future, we have to cooperate with the immigration. Though if the immigration increases, the friction will increases. But for the Japanese future we should accept the immigration and cooperate with them."
NBE05386,"I think this is a very complicated problem. In Japan, as the birthrate declines and the population ages, the population of people aged 65 or over is increasing. So Japan's social power may decline because there will be more old people who spend on social security than young people who participate social economic activities. However, long life is our dream. From these reasons, I think this problem is very complicated. Then, I think we should consider two problems that young people these days put of starting families and they have few children than before. A declining birth rate and aging population is not only our problem but also our future's problem, so I think it is important to consider deeply and live having consciousness that we are the member of our society."
NBE07110,I think this problem is very serious. I think Japan government should change system about elderly.
NBE05279,"We have something to do with this serious problem. We must support a lot of people aged 65 until retire from our own job. In addition, there is no sure proof that I can get pension for declining birth rate. I think this problem is too complicated for Japan's government to solve."
NBE06572,"The young give up having babies because of the current environment. First, it is recession. Since the young are worried about their income, they are unwilling to have babies. Second, it is about child-care leave. Since it is difficult for them to get a job again, they tend not to have babies. As the population of aging people increase, the young have responsibility to support aging people. I think that government should control the surroundings to increase the population of the young."
NBE05912,I think this problem is one of the most important issues in Japan. Japanese government should take steps. Otherwise Japan cannot grow any more.
NBE05140,"I think the fact which aging people increasing will be not changed and the fact will serious influence on Japanese economy. Even if aging people or retiree can get an opportunity to work, their productivity will be low. But I think Japan will have to depend on the work force of the elderly because of the declining birthrate."
NBE05642,"This news's opinion is that the society is a way of thinking to let elderly to account work. As a result of this news, I thought that I must give job opportunities in more elderly to account. This problem is very serious and is the problem that should be settled."
NBE06084,"The aging of Japan is remarkable, so I think that Japanese government should take measures. Especially I think think that Japanese government should hold a retirement age in particular because it contributes that debts of Japan of increase that people paying a tax decrease."
NBE06952,"I think this is a difficult problem, and Japanese government should consider it more serious. People can find meaning in life by working. People can feel pleasure and make friends by working. So if a retired person wants to work, a country should give him job opportunities. Nowadays, the population of young people is decreased. We shouldn't forget our society is supported by elderly people."
NBE05371,I feel that this problem is very serious and Japanese government must think the way to revitalize Japanese economic more. And I think its government had better give an opportunity for job to aging people who want to work because it is not absolute that labor force of aging people is inferior to that of young people.
NBE05114,"I think this problem is so serious. Not only Japanese government but also we ourselves must give this problem more careful consideration. We are involved in this matter. First of all, in order to solve this problem, we have reconsider about a tendency to marry later. It can bring about a declining birth rate. Young people tend to think that it is not easy to marry and bring up children. It is partly because of unfavorable employment conditions. We have to improve labor conditions. Secondary, we have to suggest new type of company or job that elderly people can easily work for. For example, I think that elderly women can work as baby-sitters because most of them has an experience of child care when they were young mother. As stated above, we can do a lot of things to solve this problem."
NBE05420,"I think this problem is very difficult. Some older people can work more, but other people cannot do it because of illness and so on. My grandmother lives on a pension, and she doesn't work. I have never think of her working more, and, to tell the truth, I hope she doesn't do. But, their annuity is covered by our tax! I don't want to work them, but young people are decreasing. It is really serious problem."
NBE05296,Aging problem is serious in Japan now. Elderly people is increasing. I think working problem is the most difficult. What elderly people need is the measures to those who can work and who cannot work because of their illness.
NBE05437,"When I read this article, I thought this problem was very serious and it had to do with medical development and improving the health service. This is very difficult problem s. Those developments are of course needed by everyone. Nobody wouldn't like to live. However, it will cost government to continue them. Also young people will have to pay more tax. We should consider what we do."
NBE05350,"I think aging problem is very serious because the burden on each young person will increase more and more in terms of the pension, the insurance and some kinds of tax which are used for elderly people. It means decline of Japanese economy that young people supporting the economy are pressed."
NBE05194,"I think that this aging problem in Japan is so serious. The government of Japan values the elderly people's lives , but don't help young people. I suppose that Japanese government should assist young people more than elderly people , because the young have the future."
NBE05421,"The young have the future, but elderly people have it too. So your idea is difficult to come true. And the government helps us a little."
NBE05223,"I agree with you. There are many elderly people who can work even if they are over 60 years old. If government allow them to work for a long period, dept of Japan will be decreased even a little. Japanese government should think about this problem for our future."
NBE07272,I agree with your opinion very strong. People in Japan have to be dealt equally. So the government and some administration will not help your plan.
NBE05193,I think so too. Too many elderly people can be problem. It affects young people. I suppose that the increasing of young people is related to economy growing.
NBE05326,I agree with your opinion. I think Japanese young people have to supporting the economy.
NBE02627,"The proportion of people aged 65 or over will get higher, it means the working population will decrease. It is not good to Japanese society because if the working population of Japan decrease, Japan becomes weaker. The retiring age in Japan is 60 in the status quo but now the time to change this system to increase the working population, I think."
NBE01902,"I don't think we need to be apprehensive that lack of labor force makes Japan fall national power. It is because industrial robots will make up lack of labor force. However, it's not mean that we can take a rosy view. Japanese government will not collect a lot of tax. Japan's pension scheme might unravel. I think that Japanese government must consider its plans."
NBE02603,"I think this problem has a big effect on Japan. At first, the pension system will collapse. It is said that today two young Japanese people pay for a pension of one elderly people. If the number of the elderly sharply increases in the future, we will not have the enough number of young people who can pay pensions. Moreover, some young people emigrate foreign countries because they wonder whether they can get pensions when they get old and they don't want to pay high pensions. In these ways, this problem will weaken the national strength of Japan. Therefore, we need to have measures to this problem; for example, raising the age of pensioner and making labor opportunities for the elderly by extending the retirement age."
NBE02427,"I think there are three key ways in order to get the labor fore. One of them is employing people aged 65 or over. As employers get older the salary becomes high under current salary system(but it is collapsing these days) , so I think employees don't willingly hire aged . However, I think it is wasteful for corporations or employees to dismiss elderly people because they have valuable experiences accumulated for a long time. Other one is employing women. Although the number of working women is increasing , they quit the job in their early age because of caring children, nursing and so on. We should make society which is comfortable for working women. The last one is introducing foreigners. I think We should solve problems to accept them, for example cultural differences, the gap of language and limitation of license. But we are compatriot of the earth so I hope we can help each other. I think we should make attractive and enlivened Japan where foreigners want to immigrant."
NBE02032,"I think Japan have to accept immigrants to support labor force I have two reasons. First, now birth rate is decreasing and we can't bring up manpower right now Moreover, there are a lot of young people who think it's difficult to have family. So we can temporary Second Aging people have handicap. It is definitely unavoidable. Even if they can work in social activity, they can't take part in some of the jobs because of their handicap. So we have to make up for the lack with accepting immigrants Although there are a lot of problems to accept immigrant, we can't solve this problem right now. That is why I think we have to accept immigrants."
NBE01742,"I think economic prosperity encourages the young people to have families most. The richer their lives become, the more people will decide to get married and have families. Then I think the older's taking part in economic activities and using more money are important. The rate of the older has been increasing rapidly. It should not be good to let them all retire because they are so many and they can still contribute to economy with their experiences. We have to get more flexible and accept the change of the structure of labor. And, many of the older keep much money because they tend to spare money for the future or their grandchildren. The market should change their thoughts on money and attract their attention more to encourage them to use more money."
NBE01564,"Problems of aging society will impose heavy burden on young people and Japanese economy. To keep and improve Japanese economy, we need to help elderly people work longer so that they can share their great experiences and techniques with younger generations. In addition, the government and companies should enable young people to work and take care of their children or elderly parents at the same time more easily in various ways such as supporting financially and enriching a child care leave system. Moreover, it may be a good way to accept foreign workers especially from Asian countries. Even though this is a serious matter, it might be a big opportunity to reconsider the system of our society and make it better. I hope that Japanese people think about this problem in a positive manner."
NBE02576,"I think this problem is very serious. Present Japan is hyper aging society, so to increase elderly people and decreasing young people is dangerous problem. I think growing the opportunity that aging people get their job should be conducted immediately. In future, the old people will support the society."
NBE02840,"Japan is a eminent country where many people live to an advanced age and I think we are able to be proud of it. However, I think it is not good that a birthrate is being declined every year and the government leaves the present society system. First, the government must arrange an environment of child care. Now, the number of day care centers is not enough at all and a return of people who took a maternity and child-care leave is difficult. Many Japanese young people came to find out almost only trouble in a marriage and being blessed with children. The government must support them so that they can find out happiness in a marriage and child care. Second, it is important to support that elderly people can participate in the labor market or in social activities. There are many elderly people who don't know what to do with their free time and ability. It is good that they play an active part in realm of child care. Then economic productivity will increase and I think the situation will take a turn for the better future."
NBE02837,"Declining the total fertility rate is the most tragic problem in Japan. This problem is heavily linked to the aging society. I want the Japanese government to spend more money to help parents with bring up their children. In Switzerland, the total fertility rate is amazingly high though there are many married couples who both work. One of the reasons of that is in that country, parents can be given much money from the government. I think Japan should solve the problem by imitating Switzerland in such a point."
NBE02832,"To solve this problem, I think the Japanese government should take a new look at a social security system to people can have babies with no concern, for example, about return to their job. If there are a lot of baby in Japan, they will be the labor force in the future. Also, the Japanese government should give elderly people more opportunity in their job. Certainly, elderly people have less strength than young people, but they have a lot of knowledge and experience and can teach young people. It is important that elderly people feel they participate in the society."
NBE02834,"A elderly person is increasing, and children are decreasing. That mean workers are decrease. Although the elderly person receive a pension, the young workers are very few, so their pension tax become too heavy gradually. Moreover they are worried about their future whether they will be able to receive plenty of pension or not. That is also one of the factor they put off their family and children. If the young person save money and expenditure for their future , a economic condition go on getting worse. However long we are waiting, this bat cycles have not improved at all. If a good situation they are able to have a family and baby is prepared, the people who would like to have these positively is not increase probably. That problem is serious, so Japanese government should cooperate with companies for making good systems which people have family and baby positively . Companies should make a more kind system they take a maternity leave , and they can come back their work. It should be not only for women, but also for men. The government should discuss it in the Diet, and take positive measures to deal with the complex problems. The problem's effect is incomprehensible at soon, but if we postpone dealing with the problem, this become too serious to solve later on . I know this is so difficult , but we should do anything for our better society."
NBE02836,"I feel that certainly an aging population has many problem, but we should adapt to the environment positively. As a first step, we should prepare working opportunities for elderly people who are keen to remain in the labor market or in social activities. Certainly they don't have much physical strength, but they have a lot of wisdom for life. So I think if we can prepare not physically hard working opportunity (for example teaching) for them, the situation around us will be changing."
NBE02838,"Some older people live for work, the other older people live for having a good time with their family, exercising favorite sports. To face each other this problem, we must think their old age of happy. I suggest policy for aging society. First, agency must hold a seminar for them. they support how to write a resume, how to build contacts. It makes happy for older people who want to work. Second, We must establish opportunity for older people with younger people. It's important for us to live close together in aging society. I think we must create society which older people can freshly live."
NBE02839,"Today, Japanese society has been aging increasingly. I have heard this repeatedly. I consider what I can do at every time. Of course, it cannot stop that elderly people increase in number. Therefore, it is important for elderly people to make the society which lives easily for elderly people. Especially I sympathized with ""aging people can participate in the labor market"" described with this report. Because it is impossible to perform this thing , I would like to keep on continuing to consider this."
NBE02833,"According to this article, the population aged 65 or over will reach nearly 40% of Japan's population in 2060. This is not for Japanese economy because this means that the workforce is getting reduced. I think that we have to do something we can do to improve the situation. For example, we have to change pension system to take care of elderly people. Also, I think companies should hire more and more people aged 65 or over. Nowadays, there are not enough job opportunities for elderly people, but I think this is unfair for them if they want to work. Furthermore, Japanese economy getting worse, the number of people who have babies has been declining. I think this is very severe problem. Therefore, I really want everyone to think about such problems, and the government to make plans to solve them."
NBE02835,"My country is decreasing young people. More and more working people will decrease in the future. So Japan's government takes measure to this situation. For example, companies hire more over 65 people as over 65 people can get a lot of work. There should be a lot of work that they can do. If so we may secure the work force. In this way, I think that the government should take some measures immediately."
NBE07149,"I think increasing the population of people aged 65 or over is a serious problem. So we have to think about the way of managing. One is how to increase young people, another is how to look after aging people. The more aging people increase, the bigger the burden young people deal."
NBE05504,"I was surprised when I read this article. I knew Japan is an again society, but I didn't know the proportion of people aged 65 or over will reach nearly 0.4 of Japan's population in 2060. It's serious problem. Even now, there are many problems about elderly . For example having lack of care givers and nursing facilities. Progressing Japan's technology has treated various disease and people have been able to live a long life. It's wonderful, but there are few people helping the elderly. So, I think that it is important for us to keep a lookout on each elderly and live together."
NBE06598,"If we leave something as it is, The proportion of people aged 65 or over is 0.5 or over. I think Japanese government should make a chance elderly works. It is wasteful that elderly want to work abound. If they work, the economy grow and cost they support increase fully."
NBE05674,"I think, in order to face this aging problem, Japan's government should propose policies not only for elderly people but also young people. Because, If young people worry about their future and emigrates to the foreign countries, Japan's economy will decline and government cannot afford for paying pension for elderly people. I think this vicious cycle should be broken as soon as possible."
NBE06440,"Medical care developed in the present age, and a human average life span spread. Therefore there are many cheerful people even if they become 65 years old. It is necessary to provide the employment opportunity to the elderly person to rebuild economy turning worse of Japan."
NBE06055,"I think it is really deeply problem especially economic conditions. Already, we can't stop the increasing population of elderly. I hope robots will take part of labor force instead of human in the future."
NBE05031,"When I read this article, I remember my high school teacher's words. He said to us, ""you have to know that your generation is to be hard because you have the twice elderly people when you are working. "" This situation is unavoidable so I want to continue to thinking and leaning."
NBE06439,"I think so, too. I think that changing the age of the resignation I let the working population increase and economy of Japan activate."
NBE05643,"Your comments is true. That's reason is medical care developed in recent year. My town's old people increase. I meet many old people. We must protect an old man from now, because it is them to have brought up present Japan."
NBE07179,"Since we are facing this big issue, we have to increase the number of young people. there are many possible answers to this question, like immigrants, but there are also as much problems as the answers are."
NBE06842,"It is very serious problem about aging for Japan. Working power will be decrease and Japan's power too. I think we have to developing robot and use substitute for man-power. We use robot for work, supply foods, make energy. It is one way to solve the aging problem."
NBE00598,"All Japanese should not abdicate writing in their language. Because the language is a kind of the cultures. We need to inherit this culture. For that, we have to keep the opportunities to write characters in longhand. For example, exchanging letters with friends frequently is one of the ways to maintain the faculty."
NBE00584,"Many Japanese is said to lose their Kanji skills in the article. I think so too. I sometimes cannot recollect Kanji which I want to write. However, I think that it is no need to make children write Kanji hardly. This is because there are dictionary."
NBE00575,"I agree with this article when I read it. Recently, many technical machines were invented by many companies such as computer and smartphone. When we write e-mail, we don't need to think how to write kanji. This causes this huge problems in Japan. If we write kanji by hands, there are many good points. For example, if we don't know how to write kanji, we can search it and also remember it at the same time. Then we can learn many other new kanji characters. We should solve this problem by learning how important kanji is."
NBE00560,"I think Kanji is one of the most important culture. We use computer or cellphone every day and it is necessary for us recently. So, we should increase the opportunity to write kanji."
NBE00547,"I don't think Japanese people is getting indifference to kanji. I often hear that the number of people who try kanji skill test are on the increase. As far as I know, many people still has motivations to improve their kanji skill. I agree , however, that Japanese people have fewer opportunity to write kanji than before. We use computers to produce documents or use emails instead of postcards. Serious thing is that the lack of opportunity to write kanji can lead to the decline of whole ability to use Japanese. It's because writing kanji is not only learning the letter itself but also learning Japanese vocabulary. The most serious thing is that children will not be able to acquire kanji sufficiently. Now elementary school is the only place where students are taught how to write kanji and practice it through taking notes. If the computers are introduced into all the classes, it deprive children of the opportunity to learn kanji. For children, writing kanji on notebooks may be the best way to learn kanji."
NBE00561,"I don't know Chinese grammars well, but we can explain any words by using 'kana', so I don't think that Japanese people are forgetting 'kanji' is bad. Now in Japan, if you can write difficult words by kanji, you will be praised and thought smart. But reading or writing kanji is good for only at school or private time, using computers well is more important in the company well. The needs of society is changing moment by moment, and someday, the needs of 'kanji' may come again."
NBE00549,"I don't think the problem with which this article says that we Japanese are confronted is serious . I agree that the Kanji is one of the Japanese culture and we need to find a way to make future children to understand how to use them. but I disagree with the comment. First, none of us have almost forgotten the 'kanji' which we have to write by hand at least in everyday life. Secondly not only 'kanji' but 'hiragana' or 'katakana' can we use. If we forget some 'kanji' words, we can express what we want to easily by them. Third even if we forgot some words, 'modern communications technology' could help us. Therefore I don't think that we have been in trouble with writing some 'kanji' in everyday life and that the problem is severe . It may be important to learn 'kanji' in the childhood and succeed this tradition, but we don't have to deplore that we lose ability to write 'kanji'."
NBE00568,"I agree with general ideas of Japanese that afraid of declining Kanji skills, especially future generations. In fact, smartphone is trend and it accelerates the problem, I think. However, Japanese should be able to write Kanji by hand correctly. Though Kanji is from China, I believe it is one of Japanese important cultures. It's natural to protect own culture."
NBE00599,I agree with ID12054's and ID12028's idea. We Japanese should continue writing Kanji by hand as our traditional culture. In addition I have another reason for this. These days some people that we need not write Kanji by hand because of computers and smartphones. However I think that we need write Kanji by hand to grow intelligence since we are children.
NBE00597,"Since we have many convenient technology like tablet , smart phone , laptop. Those things give us less opportunity to write Kanji. I go university so I sometimes write Kanji when I need to write down during classes. But My parents said they mostly use computers during their works. it depends occupations but i guess we Japanese have few opportunity to write Kanji. If we lose ability to write Kanji we might lose cultural identity ."
NBE00595,"When I read this article, I think it's true like other people have said. I also think we have fewer opportunity to write Kanji. Some people who have commented said we have ""Kana"" as well, and we could use that to write. However, I think ""Kana"" is designed to support use of ""Kanji"". I think using ""Kana"" mainly shouldn't happen. I think we need some plan to have more opportunity to write ""Kanji""."
NBE00607,"As we are exposed to smartphones and computers in our everyday lives, we have less opportunity to write Kanji. Naturally we start forgetting how to write Kanji. Some say that's a serious problem, but for me, it's not a big deal. Although we do not write Kanji compared to the past, we can't avoid seeing and reading Kanji in everywhere. We feel our ability to read them is not decreasing and that's why this article said that Japanese are losing ability to ""write"" Kanji , not ""read"" Kanji. Of course sentences written in only Hiragana or Katakana are extremely difficult to read, but in this modern society, we mostly use smartphones and computers when we contact people except for talking. We send e-mail, use twitter or line, create a Word document for meeting and so on. We can read Kanji, so we can choose correct one from character conversion. In conclusion, we can contact people smoothly even if we cannot write Kanji."
NBE00582,"I think that this problem is very serious. Because Japanese people have used kanji for a long time. This tradition should protect. But, by using kanji conversion function of phone, usually young people have not written in kanji. More over I think that even old people have not done. It is very important for us not to depend on phone."
NBE00608,"The article makes me to consider whether we still need to write Kanji by hand or not. Even though 66.5% of people have fear against forgetting to write Kanji, they do not try to stop using electric equipment which write it quickly and correctly instead of you. But I don't want to lose the opportunity to write Kanji by hand. Each Kanji has meaning and they show it in the most simple way. Kanji is the most smart and interesting character in the world. Because they recognize Kanji's importance and convenience, so many people have fear to forget about it. Also, it is sad to forget the character which we have learned from young. It is no need to stop using electric equipment, but required to try to write Kanji by hand as much as possible, in everyday life."
NBE00590,"Today, many people use PC or smartphones, thanks to them it is not need to write Kanji correctly. These are great helps when we write a paper or send e-mails. I also sometimes feel I'm losing ability. But Kanji is Japanese important culture and we have to keep up this tradition. So we have to get more opportunity to write Kanji with hand."
NBE00546,It is deplorable that some Japanese people lose their ability to write kanji because of the spread of PC or cell phones. I occasionally write kanji characters making strokes in the wrong order. I've heard that people tend to be more tenacious if there is a reward for the effort. So I think providing opportunity to test people's ability to write kanji such as the Kanji Aptitude Test is effective in making people interested in writing kanji.
NBE00605,I agree that the Kanji is one of the Japanese culture but I disagree with ID12038's idea because i think if we can read it and understand the meaning perfectly there is no point for writing kanji i guess. therefore i think we do not need to solve this problem as soon as possible but we need to find a way to make future children to understand how to use them.
NBE00556,"I don't dislike kanji characters unlike this survey because they look cool and smart, I think. This news overstates the problem that we may lose Japanese kanji abilities. It is because we have few possibilities that we will decline and lose kanji in our daily life because kanji characters have taken root among Japanese for huge ages."
NBE00551,"The society changes rapidly now. It's natural that many people input a letter with a computer. But, writing a kanji by hand is needed. We should write a letter by hand since we were child. I want to regard more Japanese culture as important."
NBE00594,"I really agree with ID12055's idea. I think that I have been losing my skills to write kanji because of smartphones and PC. However, kanji is Japanese culture, so we should not reduce the ability to write kanji."
NBE00574,"I think this news is natural. I always use a cellphone. And, I send emails. Then, I use many kanji. But, there are a few kanji that I cannot write. I have heard such news. Many Japanese can read difficult kanji. But, they cannot write. I am such a person, too. Recently, people reduce an opportunity of writing a character by hand because of an advance of science. It is not bad because I think although we do not write kanji, we can communicate."
NBE00578,More and more Japanese people is losing their ability to write Kanji. I also often can't write correct Kanji by hand. This is serious problem. There are many words which have same reading but different meanings in Japanese. Kanji helps us understand the meaning of the word. So we should face this problem as possible as soon.
NBE00553,"When I read this article, I wasn't so surprised. Because, I am feeling my kanji skill is failing recently. After I entered university, I often use computer to make documents. And, I sent e-mail everyday. As a result, I don't write kanji by hand much. I can read so many kanji, but I can't write difficult kanji , for example, ""utsu"". I am afraid of decreasing my kanji skill. And, I think this problem is so seriously for Japan. Kanji is precious culture. We have to make an effort keeping own kanji writing skill. I'm going to try to write kanji by my own hand everyday."
NBE00569,"I think the Japanese losing ability to write kanji due to emails is severe problem, especially to Japanese children. Nowadays, elementary school students are natural to have modern communication technology and this is the core reason why they are losing such an ability. When the adults were young, they did not given those devices so they are somewhat forced to write kanji, which means they are given opportunity to write kanji. But children today can get away from writing kanji and so they are lacking the opportunity to write kanji. In other words, adults today have the basic ability to write kanji because they have learned once and it is easier to recall again once they have built the foundation of writing kanji, but children today are lacking the foundation from the beginning and it can be too late to gain the ability after they get older. Also, some will say that you can learn kanji from modern communication technology and there are hiragana or katakana to communicate with each other, but it is unlikely to assume that the proper way of using kanji and tradition of using proper Japanese can be preserved through the device. ( Not to mention the difficulty of communicating only using hiragana and katakana when the context is complicated. ) However, it is true that we cannot stop this trend of using modern items so what we have to do is to place more emphasis on education of writing kanji in the elementary school. The problem of lacking the ability to write is not only unique problem to Japan. We can say the same thing to children in USA or Britain as well. Because many of the students use short cut messages when emailing to frieds, many of the students are forgetting the proper spelling of words. Anyway, as I have said before, we cannot stop this trend of using modern technology but we can concentrate more on writing skills at school, and maybe schools need to teach their students about risks of using modern technology as well."
NBE00557,"We have to think seriously that problem. Writing kanji is one of Japanese culture, so losing skills of writing kanji means losing a part of our culture. I think children should practice writing kanji more, and I agree with the opinion that we must consider how children should be taught to use computers, the agency said. From the view of communication skill, children don't have to use computers so much. Communicate with others by using letter namely by writing kanji by hand may help children to establish good human relations."
NBE00536,"It is a grave problem for Japanese people to forget writing enough numbers of kanji. If Japanese people can't use kanji , they will make it difficult to live by Japanese language. Thanks to kanji, we can read Japanese sentences more clearly. But I also think Japanese students should not cut down the time to learn the skill of computers because of this ""kanji"" problem. The abilities to use computers are essential for the students to live in the future in this world. How to balance between calligraphy lesson and computer learning is the problem for us to think about."
NBE00558,"I think that Japanese people are losing the ability to write kanji certainly. But i also think that it is not very important thing. At present, we use e-mail. But in early time, when people are at another place, if they would like to communicate with each other, the way of communicating is only writing a letter. So Japanese people are accustomed to writing kanji. However, when we use e-mail to communicate with other people and type kanji by cell phone, cell phone in itself can transform letter into kanji. So even if people know just vague kanji's figure, they can type the kanji because they remember it's figure. In this article, it is very important problem in the society. But I don't think so. This is because who can have the skill of writing all kanji? Who also can remember the order of writing kanji? It is said that this order is important. But maybe, most of people don't know it just like kanji learning at the elementary school. And also when people transform letter into kanji by cell phone, they have to know the kanji's meaning. If they know the meaning, it isn't matter in the society because they can understand this sentence. I think that the problem in the society is that they cannot understand the kanji in itself. The root of the cause is Japanese education system. So we have to make effort to solve the problem not blaming e-mail."
NBE00591,"I think kanji is one of the most important Japanese culture. Therefore, losing Japanese's ability to write kanji is serious problem. I like Japanese language because of its warmth, which is due to kanji. But I also feel I am losing ability of writing it. Nowadays, Japanese students study both computer skills and writing kanji. But I think kanji writing is treated lightly. Leaving as it is will bring about break down of Japanese traditional culture. We must rethink how important kanji is for our culture."
NBE00552,"In my case, I heartily felt that I forget kanji now when I am in Japan more than when I study in abroad. I used to write on note when I practice Japanese words. However, after I started living in Japan, I realized that memorize kanji is not that important to live in Japan. Of course kanji is vital when student take term examination however, when I communicate, or writing reports, iPhone and computer assist me to change hiragana to kanji automatically. For this reason, I firmly assert that teaching child with computers is not appropriate. I think children have to learn their languages with their own hands. It is inevitable to write a report with a computer when they grow up so, at least they have to be accustomed to write kanji when they are young."
NBE00541,"There are some people who say that forgetting kanji is not really a big problem but I totally disagree this idea. It's true that writing skills of kanji is not necessary in our normal everyday lives. . . . since we use iPhones and computers to have contact with each other. However, thinking about that we were all born in Japan and how important it is to protect our culture, I can't help saying that lost of our writing kanji skills is such a disappointing thing. I believe we should be able to write kanji as long as it is our old, and wonderful culture."
NBE00581,"Actually, I think the issue is not so big a problem. I guess we cannot go against the current of the times which is trying to deal all the things by using computers. In that way, we cannot help losing the ability to write the kanji. Of course I feel a bit sad 'cause we're gonna lose a part of Japanese traditional culture. But think about the past! Could we preserve all the traditional culture? Never. So maybe we need to compromise with the matter, and let us get a better life by using lots of convenient tools."
NBE00539,"I am poor at writing Kanji. Because I don't have a lot of times when I write Kanji. I use a smart phone and a personal computer. So I don't have to write Kanji. But I think that we should be good at writing Kanji. Because Kanji is a system made by ancient. Kanji is also beautiful and cool. And writing Kanji beautiful is a skill needed by Japanese society. I can't write words correctly and beautifully. So I respect people who can write words correctly and beautifully. In elementary school, teachers should teach more about Kanji. By the way, I want to get pre-1 grade of kanji skill."
NBE00585,"Since I deeply love Kanji personally, and this is one of the important culture of Japan, this was very sad news for me. However, with transliteration function of computers or cellphones, we can make sentences with correct Kanjis. So, ultimately, what we need to have is ability of reading Kanji, not of writing kanji. Therefore, I think this will be less and less important issue as the technology replaces with handwriting."
NBE00589,"I think the order of kanji strokes are something very important when writing by hand. The balance and the appearance of the kanji differs when we don't use the proper order. On the other hand when we write kanji in proper order the kanji looks beautiful. Japanese people are often particular about this appearance. Also, Kanji is ancient and very important Japanese culture. We should be proud of kanji and we also should respect and protect our culture. . I myself am not against the use of mails and new technology but I do not want to lose important Japanese culture so I will try hard not to forget easily."
NBE00600,"I think Kanji is one of the precious Japanese culture so it is a shock to hear that some people are saying that not being to write Kanji is not a big problem. Kanji makes you read easier and from the Kanji been used, people understand what the writer is trying to say. Kanji is a politeness for the reader and it is very important."
NBE00592,"I think 'losing kanji' is a natural thing. Language reflects society. Many linguists argue that languages change if society changes. There was a lot of changing in languages until now. We can find examples of language alternation easily in history. And also, a famous Korean writer mentioned that language is a creature in his book. I think this is a good sentence to explain the character of the language that changes by circumstance. And because of the internet and technology, alternation in language is more obvious in these days. For example, there is a dictionary for new words because lots of new words generated every day. I think 'losing kanji' is kind of this alteration. According to this logic, I argue 'losing kanji' is a natural thing. Kanji is uncomfortable when it comes to using a keyboard. Katakana is used instead of kanji often on the internet. Even though these kinds of alterations occur frequently, I don't think only technology made kanji dissolve. There are two alterations in Japanese kanji due to technology. One is a losing kanji and the other is the restoration of complicated kanji. For example, @@@@ was usually written as @@@@ in early days because @@ is too complicated. But even though it is difficult to remember, people can write easily with a keyboard. Because of this, I argue that technology is not harmful for learning kanji."
NBE00596,"I think forgetting Kanji is caused by increasing of using electronic things such as mobile phone, iPad and PC. One of my friend is using iPad to copy what teacher write on board. Now, young people don't communicate by hand writing. They mostly use mobile phone and internet therefore, they don't need to remember how to write Kanji. It will be big problem in future i guess."
NBE00601,"The development of our technology is most likely the reason why young people are losing their ability to write Kanji in recent years. As Gento said above, we, young people do not take note by hand writing. My friends around me bring their laptops to school and type what is on the board, and they sometimes take a picture of it with a camera of smartphones. To solve the problem, I think reading books would be efficient way."
NBE00586,"Many latest Japanese have lost the capability to write a Kanji. I may not understand a Kanji frequently, either. However, now, it is bad. It is because a Kanji is what has been transmitted from ancient times and it should hand down to future generations. People should become the society which uses a Chinese character more."
NBE00544,"It is said that Japanese losing ability to write 'kanji' due to emails. I think so too. When I write kanji, I can't remember some kanji. Then I feel the adverse effect of email."
NBE00563,"This is bad thing. Because ""kanji"" is one of the important Japanese culture. But we cannot stop this trend because of development of modern technology. In this situation I think it's important to practice ""kanji"" hard in early stage of our lives."
NBE00593,"I think writing Kanji is important. The technology has developed dramatically, so we could predict that the opportunity for writing will decrease. Although, to study the order to write it or to memorize it , writing Kanji are necessary. Furthermore, there is a culture of calligraphy in Japan. To protect this, writing is essential."
NBE00576,"I agree that we Japanese should seriously grapple with this problem. But, at the same time, children(who are not yet mastered sufficient Japanese) should not be deprived the chances of learning computers. From my experience, as an example, I had been learned how to use computers from 1st grade at elementary school. This, such as information gathering on the Internet, had often made my studying better. And also, owing to limit the time of using computers, I have been fine in using kanji. So, it's important to have a lot of chances to using kanji. The problem is many adults (or workers) depend too much on emails. They should not have enough time to writing kanji as students. It may be good for them to review their degree of dependence on emails."
NBE00564,"I think that Japanese people's Kanji skill has fallen. Due to digitization progresses, the opportunity to write by our hand is decreasing. However, I think that the capability to use the Chinese character itself does not change even if the capability to write a Chinese character falls. When we change hiragana to kanji with a personal computer, we ourselves have to decide which to use. I think that ability has not fallen, as people consider."
NBE00543,"I think that it is very big problem for future generations that Japanese losing ability to write ""kanji"". Now, due to smartphone like iPhone spread, the ability to write character correctly. I think this is very important problem and should be solved immediately. If this situation will continue, in the near future, it has a big influence for the next generations."
NBE00571,"It's regrettable problem. Because of PC and smartphone, the chance of writing kanji is going down. I think Japan needs to reform educational system and make people obligate to get ""kanken""."
NBE00588,"I think it is natural for Japanese people to loose skill of writing kanji because people daily don't have to write kanji by developing electronic device. Also I believe kanji is very important culture for Japanese. So, I think Japanese people should protect ability to write kanji."
NBE00606,"I am starting to forget how to write kanji in the right way and I think it comes from using computer as a studying tool. It is common thing to use computer to write report even in junior high school now. By using computer there would be less time for us to think about which one is the right kanji or how was the right way to right kanji. I think it is good thing to use computer to write something because it is more efficient. But I think Japanese people should be careful to have enough time to learn kanji. Sometimes I feel shame when I sow students studying abroad in Japan, writes difficult kanji which some of us don't know."
NBE00604,"I was not very surprised to know that Japanese people are losing their ability to write kanji because I have experienced not to be able to remember some characters since I got used to use computers. Even though I understand that I should write by hand as much as possible in order to maintain my kanji skill, I cannot actually do it because it is much easier and more convenient to type on computers. If all the people feel the same way and continue to avoid handwriting, what author is concerned about might come true. However, I would like to insist here that our kanji culture and Japanese pride are a lot stronger than that. Thus, I do not think that we have to take this as a serious problem for the future children and believe that they will still be able to write kanji and cherish the culture 'by blood. '"
NBE00555,"I don't know whether Japanese writing skills is losing, like that this news story says. However, these days there are too a lot of digital tools, for example smartphones and computers. So, it is right that the chance of writing documents with pens is less and less. In fact, I type on my smartphone every day. Writing kanji is important Japanese culture, so if our writing skill is losing, I think it is a big problem. However, I don't feel my writing skill is losing. I think that it is more important to make sentences to protect Japanese culture even if we use digital tools. Of cause, kanji is an old good culture. We don't have to forget them. I should use them in making documents, but it is not necessary to say for us."
NBE00538,"Japanese are losing ability to write kanji because the development of the computer has changed the whole life-style of us. Personally, I think this phenomenon reflects the times, and we cannot go against the times. So certain amount of loss is inevitable. But culturally, this damage is too serious. So we must rethink how to use computers and realize again the importance of Japanese traditional kanji."
NBE00579,"Some people say that Japanese language is ""the most beautiful language in the world"". Although Kanji has its roots in China, Japanese people has arranged them to be unique and beautiful form. So I think it's too deplorable that Kanji, a sort of Japanese ""identity"", may disappear from our culture."
NBE00540,"I doubt that emails influence writing ability. If there are not emails, we write a letter? We wouldn't write a letter, and we would use telephone. In other words, emails don't effect writing ability."
NBE00573,"Characters are one of the most important cultural aspects which make what we are. So we should worry more about the loss of writing skills of kanji because it could be a ""identity crisis"". We have a responsibility to save the culture which still remains, and pass down it to posterity."
NBE00583,"Japanese should write kanji more. I have to learn to read and write more. Japanese identity is lost. We need to reaffirm the goodness of our culture. It's not an easy thing, we do not have to work."
NBE00537,"I don't think we Japanese have to use kanji. kanji makes Japanese so difficult for foreign people, and less and less people become Japanese-phobia. It's true that it's bad young Japanese don't write kanji, but it's not necessarily bad phenomenon."
NBE00567,"I heard about that news. Less we write Kanji, less we can use Kanji. However, it's an inevitable situation. Because we have abandoned things which we didn't need to use."
NBE00548,"I disagree with ID12012. As we have less opportunity to write kanji, our ability to write kanji sharply declines. I read a book that says some high school students 50 years ago knows about 30000 words while college student today have only 15000~20000 words in average. We can guess from this book that the number of kanji in common use decreases as we are less likely to use kanji. Our ability to write kanji in common use is getting limited. Moreover, kanji has important role of conveying the concept. It cannot dispense with hiragana and katakana. We should inherit this traditional character."
NBE00550,"I think so too this article. The custom of writing a character has decreased. So, at the school, you should prepare many opportunities to write a character."
NBE00554,"I agree this comment because I feel my waiting Kanji skill is losing. I sometimes can't recall Kanji I would like to write. And I think the mainly reason is the existence of PC and smartphone, like this comment say. We don't need to write with hands. However Kanji is an important culture which expresses identity of Japanese, so we should have more chances to use Kanji with pen. This comment says almost the same may thought."
NBE00566,"The recent Japanese does not write a character. We can easily contact a partner if We send an email by carrying in the present age. In other words We did almost none of writing a character, and sending a letter. I became very sad that I knew this news. I cannot write a kanji in being ashamed that I write a character every day and want to live a life."
NBE00570,"I think his idea is very shallow. The problem we have to focus on this issue is that young generations have been more exposed to convenient tools and they are more unlikely to remember how to write kanjis. On the first level, he thinks about traditions as not so important but we have to bear in mind that tradition makes us special. What I mean here is that individuality includes traditional cultures as well and without them, you will be trifling person. On the second level, without the ability to wright kanji, it makes our life more difficult to live. It is okay when you just text messaging to your friends because you don't need to use difficult kanjis. But what happens when you enter into the society? At then, you will realize that without the ability to write kanjis, you will confront with difficulties. Once you have made basics of kanji, it is more easier to recall them again, but when using new technologies from the young age, no base will be built and it will affect to your future in a negative way. So we should take this problem more seriously."
NBE00559,This article says now many Japanese skills decrease rapidly. I have same idea. I think we Japanese should use kanji more and more. Certainly the number of kanji are increasing and English is regarded as important. So some one says Japanese is not very important. But kanji is the part of Japanese culture. We must not forget studying Japanese.
NBE00562,"I think kanji is one of several wonderful culture of Japan. We must continue to protect this precious culture. I can read ""utu"", but I can't write it. It is important to use kanji from daily."
NBE00572,"I feel his opinion is something like utilitarian way. A language, which symbolize a culture is really important to what we are. It's never the matter of utility. So I disagree with this comment."
NBE00545,"I agree with this article. I sometimes forget a kanji which I want to write in longhand. I think that it caused by the spread of telephones and PCs. I believe that Japanese must inherit kanji. We should be careful of an opportunity to write characters in longhand. For example, Nenga-jo (a New Year's card) gave us it. Japanese send it for friends, relatives or acquaintances for greeting the New Year. However, the number of Japanese who send it on the New Year's Day is decreasing. I think that we should maintain the custom forever."
NBE00565,I don't think Japanese people might lose cultural identity even if we lose ability to write kanji. You can choose which kanji should be used if you cannot write kanji by hand.
NBE00542,I think we lose. the opportunity to write kanji by ourselves. So I think we should not only increase the opportunity but also create the situation that have to write the kanji.
NBE00577,"I strongly agree with this comment, because it's idea is novel one for me in that it says that languages should change according to the ages. Although we often take things which surround us for granted, but this comment makes a good guess that happens in present changing, or the usage of kanji is changing now. I was impressed with this point."
NBE00587,"I agree with this opinion. Because, I think kanji is important culture and writing kanji is more polite to the reader, too."
NBE00602,"As technology develops, it decreases the opportunities for us to handwrite and I think that this has led Japanese people to start to forget how to write their own language. Some might say that this could lead to losing cultural identity but I still do not think that this is a serious problem. It will become a serious problem when we forget to talk and read Japanese."
NBE00603,"I did not think it was a big deal either. We still see kanji in our everyday lives and we can read it, speak it and listen to it so we have not lost something that stops us from communicating."
NBE00580,"I do not think the culture will disappear because of using the computer. Also, I suppose the opportunity of writing kanji will not increase because the IT is developing rapidly. It is inevitable. The person who commented like this do not think the thing practically I guess."
NBE00609,"The article makes me to consider whether we still need to write Kanji by hand or not. Even though 66.5% of people have fear against forgetting to write Kanji, they do not try to stop using electric equipment which write it quickly and correctly instead of you. But I don't want to lose the opportunity to write Kanji by hand. Each Kanji has meaning and they show it in the simplest way. Kanji is the most smart and interesting character in the world. Because they recognize Kanji's importance and convenience, so many people have fear to forget about it. Also, it is sad to forget the character which we have learned from young. It is no need to stop using electric equipment, but required to try to write Kanji by hand as much as possible, in everyday life."
NBE01772,"I think it sad that Japanese are losing one of their traditions. But the situation changes. In Japan each people used to learn reading, writing and calculating in their local community. Now the educational system has been changed into the Occidental way, and computers have developed. It also seems we should not stick to the handwriting culture. I think we should separate the handwriting and typewriting, and handwriting should be passed down as cultural one."
NBE02841,"I agree with this opinion. today, young Japanese usually use their sell phones or PCs to send a massage, but do not write a letter or a post card, so they cannot remember Kanjis, and they do not write Kanjis using their hands. I also use Kanjis on my sell phone using my brain not so much, so I cannot memorize new kanjis. Todays young children should write letters or post cards more, and should not use their sell phones so much."
NBE02842,"I think the Japanese losing ability to write kanji due to emails is severe problem. There are two reasons. Firstly as Japanese forget kanji, kanji - Japanese traditional culture - is gradually declining in power. Good tradition must be preserved. Secondly the ability of Japanese will be worsen."
NBE05858,"I think writing kanji characters correctly is an evidence of being a well-educated adult. So, this trend must be taken seriously. Of course, it is true that computers or mobile phone are essential for communication these days. But words are transformed predictively and automatically by these tools. All we have to do is type in their alphabet. If people rely on this function too much, they will stop writing kanji with their own hand and thinking of how to write them. The young, especially university students, should write their paper without using computers once in a while."
NBE06894,"I think that the Japanese culture of writing kanji has to be maintained and we should teach it to our children and grandchild not to pass away it. Nowadays, one of the educational policies promoted by Japanese government is that the introduction of positive English lessons makes Japanese children good English speakers. Certainly, it is so important to study and master English since children are little in the world having become globalization. But I think it is not so good that the longer time they spend studying English, the shorter time they spend writing and reading kanji. That is because using kanji is able to express various emotions. I hope to continue the culture in the future."
NBE06953,"I agree with this article's opinion that Japanese afraid of declining Kanji skills. However, I think they still have motivation to write Kanji because many people try to learn it and have its skill tests (Kanken). So if they have more opportunities to write kanji, they become more interested in kanji, and ease their anxiety. I think it is important to teach the pleasure that write kanji to children. We should continue to maintain the place where children can learn kanji from now on."
NBE06086,"Kanji is Japanese traditional culture. I started to learn Kanji when I was elementary school student and now I sometimes study it for Kanji Kentei. However when I study Kanji, I feel that I cannot write Kanji compared with the past. In Japanese, a cellular phone is commonplace. Therefore people don't write letter and use the e-mail service. When we use the cellular phone, we don't write Kanji, so we cannot write Kanji. However Kanji is important Japanese culture, so we have to protect this culture. I think the one of sentences using a kanji is easy to understand meaning of the sentences. Furthermore, Kanji is used every place in Japan, so we are inconvenience if we can't use kanji. Therefore we must study Kanji."
NBE06085,"I agree with you. I think Kanji is important Japanese culture, so we should protect it. Increasing the opportunity to write Kanji is nice idea. We have to use Kanji more positive. It isn't better to depend on a PC and smart phone. We should write Kanji with own hands. If we use Kanji, we can understand the meaning of the word easily. I think that Kanji is wonderful. I decide to study Kanji more."
NBE06717,"I agree with you. I think we don't need to think how to write kanji, too. Because we use e-mail and so on, the time when we write sentence with pen decrease. Kanji is important Japanese culture, so we should be able to write and read many kanji."
NBE05994,I think so too. Kanji is one of the most important culture. We use computer or cellphone every day and it is necessary for us recently. So we have to give Kanji's good point to other country
NBE05557,This problem applies to me. I don't usually write kanji. I often use my cell-phone. Kanji is our important tradition. We must pass our next generation Kanji.
NBE06274,"Now we use smartphone everyday, everywhere. When we explore some Japanese words, they are quickly changed to Kanji. It prevents us learn Kanji carefully."
NBE06411,"There are a few thing which I think when I see this article. I don't know Chinese grammars, but we can explain words by using 'kana'. So, I don't think that Japanese people are forgetting 'kanji' is bad. However, Reading or writing kanji is good for only at school or private time, using computers well is more important in the company well. The needs of society is changing now, and someday, the needs of 'kanji' may come again."
NBE05327,Kanji is the most important culture. Recently we use computer or cellphone every day and it is necessary for us. We should use Kanji more and more.
NBE01666,"I am poor at English, so I cannot convey my thoughts to you. At first, that is absolutely true that children who are in Japan cannot write KANJI at all. Thanks to Internets are spreading to the new generation, young people use Internet everyday. As a result, people cannot write KANJI, but I write KANJI properly. This is because I cannot use computer. KANJI is one of the most important Japanese culture of many cultures. I think that we should save this culture forever."
NBE02732,"Sad to say, not only children but many Japanese cannot write KANJI nowadays. Actually, I often forget KANJI, either. To be precise, I usually can read it, but cannot write. I guess many people are the same as me. One of the reason may be that we depend too much on technologies such as a computer or an iPhone. Of course, they are useful, so I think it is good thing to use them. However, I want to advise people not to use them too much because it might be the cause of losing your writing ability. To pass on from generation to generation as precious tokens of culture, I think we shouldn't be lazy to write KANJI."
NBE02260,"Recently, new friend's name reminds me of not face but the icon of ""twitter"" or ""LINE"". Communication on the Internet deprived not only our kanji skills but also opportunities to meet friend. A lot of people say that we should maintain our tradition. They don't welcome these changes. I agree that we should cherish our tradition, but at the same time I am all excited at the future which has many new cultures."
NBE02757,"These days, many people in Japan do not have much opportunity to write characters, because of e-mails. Consequently, people who can read characters, but not write them are increasing. This problem is very serious for us, because Kanji is one of the Japanese culture and tradition. We have to guard our culture and tradition. Therefore, I think that school in Japan should add to class of Kanji. As a result, all people in Japan can not only read Kanji but also write it."
NBE02108,"In an information-oriented society, we are demanded to use modern communications technology. As a result, we forget how to write Kanji. I think it cannot be avoided. When we write something by hand in Kanji that we forgot, we can consult a dictionary. However, concerned that future generations, I want them to learn Kanji correctly, and then, to use computers or mobile phones."
NBE02404,"Nowadays, we often use computers to write essays or an iPhone to communicate with our friends. We don't have much opportunities to write Kanji by hand. As a result, many people forget Kanji and they cannot write it sometimes. But Kanji is one of the most important Japanese culture, so we need to keep them for the future generation. So I think it is better to give more opportunities to write by hand to young people."
NBE02652,"Today, we always use computer tools in everyday life to write anything, that is, have less occasion to write letters by hand. Therefore, it is extremely natural for us to decline kanji skills. Actually I am often perplexed at the slip of memory of writing kanji. Although I can read a lot of kanji, I cannot take it out smoothly from my head. In my view, kanji is one of the most particular and traditional culture in the world. So we have to protect and survey it to the new generations while Japanese should build up their foreign language skills to adapt the globalization of current world. In order to do that, I strongly insist the exhaustive increase of writing opportunities because it is the most efficient way to memorize each character."
NBE01444,"These days, we have few opportunities to write Kanji by hand thanks to the communication on the Internet . We can use Kanji easily to press conversion key. Actually, I often forget how to use Kanji. I think this problem is serious because that means the decline of Japanese culture. I think we should get many opportunities to write Kanji at the office and school. I hope young people write Kanji easily and teach foreigners Japanese culture."
NBE01805,"It is true that Japanese are losing ability to write kanji because of e-mails. On the other hand, developed communication tools like cellphone and computer are useful. E-mails have many advantages. We can convey our messages quickly and easily. As a result, we don't have as many opportunities to write kanji by hand as before. But I don't think we can lose ability to write kanji because it has been tradition of Japan to write Japanese. It is necessary to teach to children how to use computer properly, but giving a lot of opportunities to write characters to them is also important. We can keep up both e-mails and ability to write kanji."
NBE01229,"Kanji is very difficult to memorize. Especially ""utu"" is the one of the most difficult ""Kanji"" as this report write. Now I will introduce how to write it. ""Linker drink American three cups of coffee. "" Please try this ! I think it is most important to write many times. Because people always forget if they write one time. I suggest that children should study with Tensei Jingo"" The way of this study is easy. To write it as the same of the paper. This will give them good skill !!!!!!!!!!!"
NBE01690,"In my opinion, the writing skill is no longer essential because we can do almost everything with computer, cellphone, and something like that on study and business, and which has caused the problem. It means that the writing skill isn't needed any more. Therefore, I suppose that the decreasing is not a problem to survive in present day. However, it's a problem to Japanese culture, because kanji is one of the most important Japanese cultures, and I want to preserve this Japanese identity. Therefore, I think that Japanese people's writing kanji skill should be kept in an ample level for succeeding Japanese culture."
NBE01888,"We now frequently use computers or smartphone or tablet to communicate with friends. We don't have opportunities to write Kanji by hand so much. Kanji is important Japanese culture, so we have to keep them."
NBE02854,"I agree that recently there are a lot of Japanese whose ability of using Kanji has been decreasing. It is true that the opportunities of writing Kanji are dropping due to the rapid progress of IT technology. When we write reports, letters and so on, all we have to do is to type words into our computers. In fact, declining in opportunities to write Kanji on paper make me difficult to come up with so many kinds of Kanji in daily life. However, using IT, there may be some good aspects to improve the ability of using Kanji. If we see the Kanji we cannot read, electronic dictionary tells us how the Kanji read. If we don't know the correct way of using some words of Kanji, via computer we may understand the way. In next generation, we must look for the best way to increase the ability of Kanji with using IT technology."
NBE02858,"Unfortunately it is true that Japanese are losing an ability of writing Kanji. I think that an electronic technology is source of problem. For example, PC and mobile phone is. Actually, Not only children but also adults become not able to write Kanji very well. It is crucial to expand electronic technologies. However, it makes Japanese ability of writing Kanji get weak. We begin not to write Nengajo in the first month, January. In stead of Nengajo, we send an e-mail to our friends. In other words, we lose an opportunity to write Kanji. Using PC to take a note in the class is increasing. Therefore our ability of writing Kanji will get weak from now. I think a solution of this problem is keeping Japanese traditions, Nengajo. The custom of writing a letter is a first step to solve this problem."
NBE02863,"I sympathized with this opinion. When I was a high school student, I used my phone in stead of my dictionary to check how to write Kanji which I can't write correctly like @@, @@. I realized my ability to write Kanji when I started to write Kanji positively for my entrance exam and wrote a great deal of Kanji everyday, so I can write Kanji like others now. However, I regretted having used my phone to check how to write Kanji, because the older we are the worse we remember, so it was difficult for me to remember a lot of Kanji. I think parents should teach how to write Kanji by their children's body before teaching how to use computers."
NBE02845,"According to this article, there's a serious problem that the number of Japanese losing ability to write 'kanji' is increasing. I think this trend is not very good because ability to write 'kanji' is necessary to communicate with each other. It is true that we can now easily communicate with many people by using Internet. However, 'kanji' has tradition between Japan and China , so I think we shouldn't lose the ability. To solve the problem, we have to try something we can do. For example, education system should be changed , and we can make better environment for children to learn 'kanji' . For me , studying for 'kanji kentei' was very good to learn 'kanji', so I think more children should try such test. There are various solution , but I think the most important thing is our feelings to try to maintain 'kanji'."
NBE02851,"Today, we use computers and cellphones to do many things, such as sending e-mails, writing reports. There are few opportunities to write Kanji with your hands. So, a lot of Japanese people are losing ability to write Kanji. This is a serious problem. This problem is not just a problem in Japan. I found that it also occurs in China on the Web. If this problem is getting worse, no one will be able to write Kanji in the world. What should we do to avoid that situation? It is probably important to have more education program of Kanji. However, I believe nothing is more important to have a sense of crisis about this problem and make positive efforts to write Kanji with your hands."
NBE02864,"I regard Japanese Kanji problem as questionable. Actually I think my skill of writing kanji is declining, too. Now is the age of information. In Japan, the saturation level of phone and smart phone is more than 100 percent in 2011. Not only children but also adult are being separated from writing kanji in hand. It's important to raise the level of the skill of computer, but we should not forget writing Japanese languages IN HAND. I think when we write letter the best of way to understand partner is the letter by analog ."
NBE02843,"I think that the Japanese people have to save KANJI as one of the Japanese cultures. It is true that we do not need to write KANJI when we use E-mail and cellphones in order to communicate with people. However, there are some features in the Japanese language we cannot find when we use electronic devices. First, we can guess our friends' feelings. The strength of a brushstroke in a letter tells us writer's feelings to some extent. Second, if we write KANJI regularly and know a lot of KANJI, we can guess the pronunciations of KANJI we don't know."
NBE02853,"I think that the ability of writing kanji is declining. Today, we can use cell phone and computer. We can communicate with our family or friend by them not writing letters. So we have many words which we can read and understand but cannot write. I often experience that situation. However, we still have to write kanji, and kanji won't become disused. Kanji help us understand the sentence. Without kanji, our life would be inconvenient. Thus we should be given the opportunity to write kanji correctly. Young and old of both sexes should have the chance to learn kanji and our society must give the chance regularly."
NBE02844,"It is true that more and more people are becoming unable to write kanji correctly due to the modern communication technology. However, it is wrong that we attribute this problem completely to the technology. So, those who have something to do with the education have to be eager in making much more opportunities for students to write kanji, I think."
NBE02860,"I've known the problem that the number of Japanese people who are unable to write KANJI correctly is increasing. Now, It's the time to think about the problem seriously. I think KANJI is one of the most important Japanese culture. Moreover, KANJI is the part of our lives as we can't live without it. I strongly insist that more opportunities must be reserved in school days. For example, introducing the classes of KANJI in junior high schools. Why can we say ""I'm Japanese. "" without KANJI skills?We have to be aware of being Japanese."
NBE02859,"We use a smart phone many times in our life these days. So we cannot write Kanji more than ten years ago. However it is important for Japanese to write Kanji correctly because it is culture we must acquire. Therefore we have to get more opportunity to write Kanji , such as writing a letter."
NBE02857,"Need to write a letter with the development of the information society has been lost. But, a letter is important culture. We have to protect the culture. We need effort to do so."
NBE02850,"When we get in touch with friends, we use an e-mail instead of a letter. In the old days, writing a letter by handwriting was a main means to communicate. Recently, however, because of developments of technology, using an e-mail is more useful than writing a letter, so we lose opportunities to write""kanji"" and ability to write it. ""Kanji"" is a Japanese culture, so it is a serious problem that we Japanese do not know how to write it. I think it should provide a class of ""kanji"" at school. This will lead to improve ability of ""kanji""."
NBE02861,"They say that As we grow up we became to forget how to write a Chinese character. The electronic device spread , so we lose An opportunity to write a Chinese character . but i like write ""kanji"" and i love my name which uses ""kanji"" so, we should use more ""kanji"" and study it!!!!"
NBE02855,"I'm very surprised at how many Japanese people feel difficult to write ""kanji. "" ""Kanji"", of course it is famous, is really traditional and the center if our Japanese daily living. So we don't lose our ability to write ""kanji"" in order to protect Japanese spirit."
NBE02849,"I, myself, have the experience of forgetting a particular kanji. I believe it's unavoidable to forget them in this high-tech society with cell phones and other electronic devices, but Kanji is extremely useful and I believe it's one of the Japanese cultural identities so I hope generation under us will be educated well with kanji as we did."
NBE02846,"I think it's not so big problem. Although our ability to write ""kanji"" is actually losing and it is bad tendency, we don't have to write many kanji in first hand in our daily life. Today, we can do many things such as writing a letter, making a report and so on with computers. It is true sometimes we can't remember difficult ""kanji"" for a moment, however, it doesn't mean we can't use them. As long as we use ""kanji"" correctly, we don't have to worry about this."
NBE02856,"It wasn't until i read this article that i realized what a dangerous situation this is, that is, many young people in Japan apt to forget kanji due to the development of technology . I think it is a pity that the valuable culture of Japan is disappearing. To solve this problem, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology should take drastic measure. But i believe it'll be quite a long time before the notion of protecting our precious culture pervades our daily life."
NBE02862,"It is true that nowadays the more people are using the Internet , the less people are writing Kanji. However we have to pay attention to the fact that Kanji is estimated as an art overseas. We should remember the value of Kanji and feel sense of closeness to it. That's why I think the government have to take steps to this problem."
NBE02847,"I'm very interested in ID14050's' view point. It is true that foreigners, especially Europeans and Americans, recognize Kanji as an art, so such people use it wrong. For example , some people think there is no difference between @@ and @@. So, we must realize the fact that Kanji is not only the character, but also the art."
NBE02852,"I think this problem is so serious. And we have to deal with this problem soon, because our culture is lost. The measure to deal with this problem is to take writing Kanji into education or to focus in Kanji-kenntei. We must protect and develop our culture."
NBE02848,"Computers made our lives more comfortable . However , we may lose our culture because of them . Kanji is our , Japanese , important culture . So we have to keep them and we must not lose it ."
NBE07460,"I think Japanese people should be able to write Kanji by hand any better. In recent years, modern communications technology, such as smartphone, became general. In order to that, more and more Japanese people afraid of declining Kanji skills, as this article said. However, Kanji is one of the important Japanese culture, I think. Kanji has been used for more than a thousand years. So we must protect this important culture."
NBE05886,"I am surprised at this phenomenon, but I think we do not have to be able to write difficult characters kanji. Until 10 years ago, we needed to make a formal document by hand writing. But now, we make it by typing on a computer, without hand writing. Thus, we have to know only basic kanji which we learn in an elementary school."
NBE06869,"I think we should face this problem seriously. In Japan, there are some characters, for example kanji, kana and katakana, but kanji has meaning respectively unlike the others. My favorite kanji is ""@@"" that means ""good"", so I think kanji should be treated more respectfully than the others. Furthermore, in the world, many people know kanji as Japanese culture. By writing kanji and tasting its meaning, we must protect this culture."
NBE07398,"I think ""Kanji"" is the feature and the culture of Japan. Recently many people have computers and smart phones. These devices can translate from ""hiragana"" into ""Kanji"" automatically. so, our writing skill of ""Kanji"" is declining. However, we should reform this state for our next generation. I think the most important thing is writing ""kanji"" on paper and repeating this action. Japanese people must write ""Kanji"" everywhere. This is a cool point of Japanese."
NBE07024,"I think that it is not bad thing for Japanese to lose ability to write 'kanji'. It is because modern times result in this trend and it will be more and more unnecessary for Japanese to write 'kanji'. Instead of losing this ability thanks to computer and smartphones Japanese know much more 'kanji' than those used to. Therefore, I don't think problem as serious."
NBE06437,"Now that computers developed as essential tool for our life. If we input a letter, the computer shows the kanji immediately. This function is very convenient. So you may think that it is not necessary to learn kanji. However, kanji is Japanese culture. And the decline of the language of the country means the decline of the nation itself. Therefore I catch this problem as a serious problem and think that it is necessary to be improved."
NBE06028,"I also think this problem is very serious. I studied ""kanji"" when I was elementary school student. But thereafter I studied ""kanji"" myself for the exam. I think this is main cause of Japanese students becoming weak in ""kanji"". Now I want to propose teachers should let students take the exams. For example, there is ""kanji kentei"". Many students have 3 grade of ""kanji kentei"", but few students have grade above 3. At least, students should get the associate 2 grade or regularly take the exam of 3 grade, I think."
NBE06136,"I think this problem is so serious that we can't ignore it. I think the measures not to use an E-mail is unreasonableness for Japanese people in the modern age. So we should increase opportunities to regularly write a kanji. With current children are not interested in a kanji, they will not be interested in Japanese culture."
NBE06438,Recently I often used the computer. So I neglected that I learned a technique to write the kanji that was one of the Japanese culture . I intend to set foot in the world of kanji again in reference to your suggestion!
NBE07147,"Certainly, when we want to send messages, we write a message not on a letter but on a e-mail. Texting makes us forget to write ""KANJI"". We don't have to think the characters because words we text in ""HIRAGANA"" translate into ""KANJI"" automatically. In this way, we become not to use the brain, so we must not stop thinking and writing "" KANJI""."
NBE07148,"Japanese traditional is based on letters, so this changes may certainly surprise many people used to live. Technology will be developed much more than now, and the style sending messages and opportunities to meet friends will be changed. But, I also"
NBE05831,"I agree with this idea. When I read this article, I noticed that the opportunities of writing 'kanji' by hand decreased as same as you thought. For example, I takes two lectures on law using not notebooks but tablet. In past days, I wrote notebooks by hand using 'kanji'. We have to keep 'kanji' because it is not only important culture but also great characters that we can understand the meaning when you see only one character."
NBE06275,"Now most of us use smartphone. When we explore some Japanese words, they are quickly changed to KANJI. This system prevents us from learning KANJI carefully."
NBE05730,"I think we should pay more attention to this problem. Today, the Internet and computer are progressing really fast. We really on computers. This is not the source of the decrease of our writing ability. Tools change and develop as time passes. And our work style change at the same time. The important thing is that we shouldn't stop reading books and newspapers. If we forget characters, we lose many things; culture, tradition and history. The problem of writing ability doesn't finish itself and influence our life heavily."
NBE05438,I agree with your comments. Japanese kanji is difficult. Nobody know how many kanji we have. I think the Japanese are clever because we handle the kanji. The culture should be protected.
NBE05888,"When I read this article, I think that this invention is very exciting and helpful. It helps many people who cannot drive because of physical disabilities to go far place. However, at the same time, I think that we need a preparation of laws. For example, we need to clarify who would be responsible for, if a car which is automatically driven broke something or got involved in any troubles."
NBE05887,"I am surprised at this phenomenon, but I think we do not have to be able to write difficult kanji. Until 10 years ago, we needed to make a formal document by hand writing without computer. But now, we make it by typing on a computer, without hand writing. Thus, we have to know only basic kanji which we learn in an elementary school."
NBE00672,"I heard that the sales of CD is now declining in Japan because of illegal downloading. Therefore we can see various ways to sell CDs like AKB 48. I think that it is necessary for the market of music to tighten the regulations to protect musicians. However they may lose their popularity and income. Because their fans can hesitate to buy CDs. Generally, the surplus tightening of regulations causes downturn. We need pay attention to this issue."
NBE00680,"I think two years of prison terms and 2 million yen fines are went too far. I know downloading music or films illegally is bad thing to do but 2 million yen is too much. Instead of 2 million yen, it should be the cost of the music or film itself."
NBE00667,"I first heard this news about half an year ago. When I heard the news, I thought it's a joke because it's impossible to track down every downloads on internet. However, at the same time, I think this idea is good. There are people who felt 2 year / 2 million yen is too far, but in order to prevent people from start downloading illegal contents or stop doing that, I think it's not too far. If we lower the fine like ID12061 said, I don't think this policy work as punishment to people who downloads illegal contents."
NBE00673,This new law forbids DOWNLOADING music and movies on Internet. However this doesn't forbid just WATCHing movies and listening music on Internet. So this law couldn't aim to stop falling music sales in the music market.
NBE00685,"Same as ID12054, I heard that the CD market is shrinking now because of illegal downloading. It's not to say that this law will not effect the behavior of people at all, I still cannot believe that this will be the solution. First of all, on purpose or accidentally, many people may have conducted illegal downloading and they know how easy and convenient it is. Most of them will continue to do illegal downloading unless they are arrested. And prison terms of up to two years and fines of nearly 2 million yen is too hard for them to believe. I wonder that this number will give them some kind of relief that they will not be arrested due to this level of illegal downloading. For me, it's hard to believe that 1 or 2 downloading equal such a severe punishment. The punishment should be mitigated instead the number of apprehension should be increased and apprise people that they will easily be arrested. People will fear that the next may become them and the number of illegal downloading will decrease."
NBE00669,I think most people don't realize that downloading free music will be punished. This problem won't be solved because as ID12063 said that many people may have conducted illegal downloading and they know how easy and convenient it is.
NBE00674,"People buy CDs because they are a fan of the singer or the group. Although there is a law to stop illegal downloading, I don't think those who download music will buy the CD. So this law would not stop the fall of the CD sales and to make CDs sold, music artists should work more to increase there fans. Lastly the most thing that I think is providing people not buy CDs are that CDs are too expensive. They should be sold at a more reasonable price."
NBE00666,"I strongly agree with ID12052's idea. As ID12052 said, most people do not think that downloading the music is bad thing to do. We need to be careful about these things, otherwise we have to pay fine. I do not want to pay it, so I am not going to take care about it."
NBE00622,"Generally, I'm in favor of this new law except for the unclear definition of 'pirates '. According to The Recording Industry Association of Japan, about 90% of downloaded music are illegal. If this trend continue, those who involved in music industry get less money and they lose motivations of writing and singing good music. Also, if musicians compose or sing uninteresting music, people cannot listen to up-to-date or magnificent music. The new law will stop this trend and secure the rights of musicians. On this point, the law is beneficial to both the industry and consumers. However, there is something I worried about. Too broad and unclear definition of 'pirates ' can lead to excessive restriction of online freedom. People have no idea whether they will be punished when they download music because they don't understand what 'pirate' refer to. So there is possibility they have to refrain from downloading even legal music. It seems to justify extreme regulation of online freedom in the name of copyrights. The clear definition of 'pirates ' must be needed in order to balance the rights of music industry with the rights of consumers."
NBE00626,"Some people think that this new low is quite effective for illegally downloaded music problem and falling music sales. But, I don't think so. The causes of falling music is that the sales of CD is reducing. When we want to listen music, we go to CD rental shop, or buy date of the music at iTunes. It's so easy and economical. If illegally download is prohibited, people will not buy CD. I think , Japanese music world have to devise different policy."
NBE00650,"When I read this article, I was surprised that prison has to face terms of up to two years and fine of nearly 2 million yen when he or she downloaded illegal music or files from the Internet. At first, this punishment is too heavy for this crime. This crime is easily to occur because we use the Internet often, and I think illegal music or files are cheaper than real ones. So, many people use this sites without understanding a law. In order to prevent this crime, this punishment is very effective and I think this law helps people who download illegal music or files from the Internet. We should use computers more carefully."
NBE00630,"I agree with this new law. Downloading 'pirates' is equal to betray the musician. If you like the music, you have to answer to the musician namely pay collect consideration. I wish this law works well and decrease 'pirates'."
NBE00645,"I think this law is very effective in protecting Japanese music pricy and I also expect Japanese music industry will develop by boosting sales of CDs and digital items. Besides, I suggest Japanese music should be appreciated on Internet, for example, on youtube. In fact, South Korean music company opens their musics and promotion videos and it causes great impact of advertising and sales actually. Moreover, this idea connects to decrease of illegal download of music, I think."
NBE00616,"This is difficult problem. This problem come from Internet anonymity. In short, this is related the copyright of music companies and the privacy of people. That is necessary to correspond carefully to this."
NBE00653,"I agree with the idea that the person who downloaded the music illegally should be punished. But actually, maybe it is really difficult problem. As the technology, specially related to the Internet, is developing day by day, it is not easy to prevent such a crime , I guess."
NBE00663,"I think illegal downloading should be regulated. But the punishment, facing prison terms of up to two years and fines of nearly 2 million yen, is too far. And I think it is difficult to regulate illegally downloading. Nowadays, cyber crimes are increasing rapidly, and most of them are left as it is because of difficulty of arresting, due to the amount and anonymity of Internet. I am wondering if this law fulfill its function."
NBE00614,The illegal downloads is popular among people. Because illegal downloads is cheap and easy to do and familiar. But many companys were damaged by illegal downloads. So illegal downloads must be baned by laws. A lot of people download illegally. So the law may not work good. I think it is big news.
NBE00631,"I disagree with the new Japanese law. firstly, we don't know the range that if we download music and films, we are arrested. It is much vague. Do we are arrested only to download Youtube? There are a lot of way of downloading. We don't understand whether the site is legal or illegal when we download something. If so, we have to download as we fear the behavior. Secondly, is it truth that due to illegally download, music and film industry suffer a serious damage? For example, in Switzerland, government permitted the illegally download as legal download. Its government paid attention to the surplus in domestic economy. the surplus is that the money that be left over even if ordinary people live a common life. now, the world is falling into recession. simply, people cannot use money for entertainment because people have less money than before. But according to the government's survey, we turned out to use the surplus for another place or this industry. In other words, it is irrelevant to downloading illegally. there are many ways of earn a money in this industry such as holding a concert or planning another event. this industry try to return to the way of earn a money by selling CD or DVD. But it takes a mistake. The time is changing and changing day by day. Government don't have to protect the industry that would like to protect existing interest and have the negligence of endeavor to getting money. I think that this industry should investigate the action of consumer and make efforts to correspond to the action."
NBE00646,"I agree with the new Japanese law to ban the people who illegally download music or films. As the Korean case shows, it will probably work in Japan to some extent as well. There is no denying that it is difficult to restrict all the pirates but it will become a deterrence to a lot of people in Japan. But the problem is that this problem is severe as a globe and the truth is that illegal downloading cannot be solved only in Japan. Even if Japan makes some contribution to this problem, other democratic countries such as USA and canada, for example, emphasis so heavily on the freedom and privacy that without the corporation of the global world, it is difficult to completely solve this problem. Also, you can download from China, the country which has many illegally downloading pirates, and Chinese people can download from Japan which means this problems is complicatedly interrelating. So in order to stop illegal downloading, there need some kind of international conferences being held and make agreement or, if possible, use international criminal court. ( I know what I am saying is idealistic. ) And we also have to think about freedom and privacy in this problem so it is really complicated. Anyway, this Act will surely work in Japan to a certain degree so I hope the music and film industry to receive more money, and I hope they will make high quality music and films!"
NBE00671,Many people download movies or music illegally. They know it is illegal but many people do that so they might feel like it is okay. So we need some solutions to reform their conscience fundamentally besides the law.
NBE00649,"I think this new law will not work because the Internet is infinite world. So, they cannot exterminate all illegal downloads. Now, people buy few CDs. I think this is a trend. The music industry should think a new way to earn. I think the music industry need not be particular about selling CDs. There are a lot of TV programs about music in Japan. And, almost musicians do a live concert. I think a music industry make the best of a job except a selling CDs field."
NBE00662,"The person who download the music or the movie illegally are should be punished, but it is very difficult problem. Now, many people use the Internet and watch the YouTube free of charge. It is natural for us to listen to the music or watch the movies on the Internet. At present situation, a number of people have the possibilities of being the criminals, and managing them is extremely hard work. So I think it is necessary for us to have guilty conscience."
NBE00625,"I prefer to download and listen music illegally since it needs no money. However, in a seller's case, downloading intellectual property illegally can be a crime due to their livelihood. Therefore, intellectual property have to be protected from spreading illegally. Of course setting a law for this problem is important but the most important thing is the point that people have to realize downloading contents for free is a wrongdoing, we have to obtain other people's intellectual property by giving them proper value."
NBE00637,"Increasing the illegal download is damaging the music business world and the national economy. From the one point of views, the many music are healing many people by illegal downloads or YouTube. So I think its problem is just going around in circles."
NBE00623,"I was surprised to see that around nine in 10 downloads in Japan are illegally purchased. Honestly I downloaded some songs and movies from illegally uploaded websites before. I think the new law is necessary. Online piracy kills motivation of creation, and causes the surroundings to suppress creating new works. To wipe it out, I also think, officials need to offer opportunities for us to learn and understand fully importance of literary property."
NBE00660,"I am against this new law. Many people are not aware that illegal downloading is illegal. Also, because of the boundless number of illegal downloads, punishing them does not make the matter better. I think that we should focus on strengthening the security of things that relate with copyright like music and movies before we make a law like this."
NBE00675,"I used to downloading free mp3 musics and movies. Now, I am very afraid that the downloading those kind of things officially have been illegal and, at the same time, surprised that we possibly receive the letters from government and get warned. But, I think it is still hard to restrict people all over the world to illegal download."
NBE00629,"I agree that those who possess illegally downloaded music or films in Japan will face prison terms of up to two years and fines of nearly 2 million yen. Nowadays, the sales of CD have been decreasing for several years in addition to the withdrawal of HMV, which is the biggest and most popular CD shop. However, the introduction of this new act makes the sales of CD increase in the future. Besides, every Internet user should comply the copyright act. I have downloaded music illegally though. But at that time, I was not sure that I was committing the crime. Most of infringers do not realize their piracy like me. So the government should admonish the whole nation about what is crime."
NBE00658,"There are many people who do not know this law yet. Therefore, I think that arrest is immediate. In order to avoid this, it is more nearly required improvement in net morals and to spread law by media."
NBE00619,I agree this law. Downloading pirates prevents from musicians and film directors getting complete reward. People should get music and movies at the root of the regular.
NBE00665,"I agree with this Japanese new law, it is important to regulate it strictly. People are weak with the word of ""free""nothing will change by not regulating it strictly. The organization which was damaged by the illegal download, can't certainly said that the situation will improve. I think we need to grope for the solution."
NBE00651,"I agree to this law, because, in fact, music industry troubles due to illegal downloading. However, in practicing this law, we should clearly be informed that which music is legal or not. At present, we can't necessarily tell the difference between them. Avoiding violate the low, new system should be put in place."
NBE00641,"Although illegal download is not good to be sure, the Internet is developed increasingly and I think that it is difficult to stop illegal download even if we make severe law. But severe punishment should be needed, so as not to increase the number of illegal download."
NBE00683,"I am pretty sure that even after the new low took effect, the sales of CD and DVD wont get better. I think people especially young people these days are starting to come apart from CD and DVD because now we have new tool to use spend time like computer and iPhones. And I also think that there wont be much less people who downloads illegally. It is difficult to find people who i doing it and there could also be people who downloads not knowing what they are doing is illegal. I used to use application which downloads music from youtube with just few steps. After the low has come out, I was scared to ues the application because I wasn't sure whether it is illegal or not to use the application. So I sent a mail to the company to ask whether it is ok or not to download music using that application. The answer I got was very vague. It even said they can't answer this kind of delicate question. I am not really sure it is illegal to use it, but I am sure that there are still many people who uses those kind of applications not knowing it could be illegal."
NBE00678,"I personally agree with the law which bans illegal music downloading although some people complain about this new launch. I have once downloaded music illegally long time ago and my computer got virus from the file when opened. Since then, I have thought that any people who continue downloading music illegally could face such situation and this may cause a leakage of important information which a computer might have. I cannot think of any better solutions than banning illegal music downloads. If it also helps the music market, the law is surely the best decision of all that the government could ever suggest."
NBE00628,"In Japan, recently the sales of CD have been decreasing. In the age of our parents, the way to get music was only buying CD, so the sales of it were greatly big. However we can download music from Internet now, so there are many way to get them illegally and freely. Downloading music is cheap and easy, that is why more and more people use the Internet to get. A lot of people have illegal music in their ipods, smartphones or computers. In addition to, they don't know it is punishment. I think this situation was caused by the past that Japan's government hadn't ban this conduct more quickly. If they had banned illegal downloaded music, it wouldn't be popular now, in my opinion."
NBE00636,"After reading this article, I think this punishment is not effective because the police can't arrest all people who download illegally. Many people think this change promote to prevent illegally download but it is not true. I think we should use the internet carefully and care about ourselves."
NBE00611,"Illegal download will be regulated and punishment will be tightened. But I don't think it will works well. First, however the law may be tightened, it's no use unless the sense of guilt among listeners will change even little by little. They don't understand(or dare not to understand) why illegal download bothers artist. So they have to know cash flows and why their downloading is illegal."
NBE00612,"I think the police cannot crack down on illegal downloading because they can't investigate all the computers appropriately. But it will work as deterrent of illegal downloading. The new law may menace those who possess illegally downloaded materials. So the new law will take effect to some extent. But even if so, music sales will not improve because illegal downloading doesn't have a relation to music sales. I think music sales are in slump because we now listen to music in computers or don't listen to music as before. People aren't fascinated by CDs. So the Japanese music industry should make an effort to how to sell CDs. Fighting against online piracy is of secondary importance."
NBE00613,Author's copyright must be highly considered. But the law of author's copyright is not abided. I think this law is out of date. We use Youtube and Website and google search every day. We can easily break the law of author's copyright. We must charge the law or the concept of author's copyright. I think this situation must be changed immediately. This law make people and author uneasy.
NBE00656,This law must be done because many people download music or video. A lot of company regarding CD have lost much money because of that.
NBE00652,"I think most people who downloads illegal files do it deliberately, not without knowing, so this stricter change is necessary. But I don't think this law makes any big changes about the sales of CDs or DVDs because the cause of today's its decrease consists of many factors, not only illegal downloads."
NBE00618,"I agree to the new law. Because it is related to many problems of privacies, and we do that action without knowing, I think. So, I think illegal downloads should be restricted by strict law."
NBE00615,The reason people download music illegally is consciousness is not enough to consider it as illegal. I hope this law change become good opportunity they consider it illegal.
NBE00664,"I disagree with this law for two reasons. Firstly, It is hard to see this law can help artist can earn money and protect their right of creativity. I think this law will help the big art commerce company earn money rather help small artist. For example, in 1985 all the data from the American publicly-funded program of earth observation by the Landsat satellite were conceded to EOPSat, a subsidiary of General Motors and General Electric. As a result, the cost of access to the data increased 20 fold. Universities could no longer afford to buy the information, even though it had been obtained entirely using public money. It was used mainly for the benefit of the big oil companies, who thus received a direct subsidy. Secondly, I disagree with this law because I opposite with Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). ACTA negotiated in closed door by US, Japan, Canada and the EU. It excluded developing countries among negotiation. And European Commission was not allowed to negotiate over Article 23 - the controversial part of the treaty which not only insists on criminal penalties for piracy but also for those accused of ""aiding and abetting"" copyright infringement - the member states had to be represented at the table. They negotiated these new criminal sanctions behind closed doors."
NBE00681,I used to download too and still afraid that government might going to send me a letter because I used to download.
NBE00682,"He says that 2 years / 2 million yen for punishment is not too far but I still thinks that the punishment is too far. Because the CD itself only cost 3, 000 yen and punishment is 2 years of jail is too much."
NBE00617,"I agree with the law to punish people who have downloaded films, CDs, datas illegally because I think ""copyrights"" should be protected more carefully to reduce the worldwide crimes, and also to save the profits of the makers. I know that it is quite clear to have perfect provision for stopping illegal downloadings. However there are we should all think about this problem more , and find out the solutions and how to carry it out."
NBE00657,"I disagree with this law. I'm doubtful whether illegal downloads caused shrinking of music market in Japan. Even if that is true, the law has problem that the number of people who subject to prosecution is thought to be too large, and that it is too difficult to identify the criminals. It has been three months since the law was enforced, but I've never heard the story either that anyone has arrested on charge of illegal download, nor that CD sales has recovered."
NBE00621,"The reason why the new law is established is the recording industry has suffered serious losses because of illegal downloads. The important thing is to protect rights of copyright holders. Make people be convinced that reproducing valuable contents freely hurts makers is also important. I think adding a special favor to CDs, a ticket of the singer's concert, for example, is one of effective ways."
NBE00648,"Even police wants to control illegally download with regulations, the way of illegally download is progressing more, which the regulations cannot cover it. We must change the offenders' senses with preparing the regulations."
NBE00655,"Measures against cyber crime in Japan is always late. That copyright is violated, the singer income decreases. There is a need to avoid such a situation."
NBE00647,"Although illegal download is crime, I fear that the chance to listen to music will decrease. The access to trial listening should be retained."
NBE00661,"I disagree the comment. Many people are not aware that illegal downloading is illegal. Also, because of the boundless number of illegal downloads, punishing them does not make the matter better. It's no bounds. I think that the new law is meaningless."
NBE00644,"I think downloading is very bad thing, so 2 million yen is not so too much. Composer's right is very important."
NBE00643,"After the law which restricts free music download proclaimed, many people in Japanese continued free downloading. I think it should be reinforced."
NBE00640,"This is a difficult problem I think. As Internet society developing, we have come not to buy CDs. Actually we don't have to buy it any longer because we can get and listen songs we like via Internet. Once we know that, it's difficult to stop doing that. So I don't think the new law is reasonable."
NBE00654,"I think that it is very important for us to approve and protect this law now. In Japan, the concept of 'copyright' is clearly made much of by Japanese people than foreign people. It is true that I am enjoying the benefits of pirate versions but punishing lawbreakers and regulating the present situation will improve the music and video sales."
NBE00679,I disagree with this comment because he does not say anything about how bad it is to download music illegally and he complains that CDs are expensive. The law is obviously right as it protects the artists' copyrights and surely contributes to recording companies' CD sales.
NBE00670,I think we need some solutions that it is illegal download somehow.
NBE00668,I think this strict law will stop falling music sales in the market. No one want to be sent to a jail or pay a lot of money for it.
NBE00624,"I don't know because I don't download music or films, but I here that other person often download it from Internet sites. I always rent CD or DVD at the shop. It is difficult to supervise those people, because many people practical use it."
NBE00642,"When I knew this news, I was very disappointed. This is because I had downloaded music free well. Therefore I thought that this new law was not necessary. It may not be good to download music free, but I think that it is good without buying CDs if music spreads out in the world a lot. I think that I buy a CD and borrow it and want to obtain music from now on."
NBE00632,"It is probably that we know the the sales of CD is declining and possessing illegally downloaded music or film are bad. But we are charmed with FREE. It is very difficult problems. If police is going to arrest people who illegally downloaded, the plenty of people will be imprisoned. I think police should make the stipulations of illegally downloaded clearly."
NBE00610,"It is right that Illegal downloading is one of guilts. I agree with the opinion that this act is like thief. There are people who live by the returns of the music they make. By the way, I'm interested in the sale of CD or DVD. I wonder that the sales of them will increase after this law is enforced. Thinking about diversification of media, not all people get the music by CD. For example, they get them by online. This way of purchase can be done at home or other place. If company want customers to buy CD, they should think new value of CD, which let customers buy."
NBE00638,"I think police should make the stipulations of illegally downloaded clearly. """" I agree with his this opinion. Present circumstance of illegal download is very serious. Anyone can illegally download music and movies on the Internet. I also think that police and government should strengthen the regulation more and more."
NBE00639,"I also think that this is a difficult problem. But, ""it's difficult to stop doing that"" I don't think so. If we change the consciousness of the people, strengthen the regulation, will be no illegal downloads"
NBE00633,"As he explains, this new law just forbids downloading. Certainly these days the illegally updated movies, music, animes is deleted by the companies who has rights of those. But it is the real that we can watch movie and listen to music. In this situation, the sales of CD and movies and so on is going down. This law must be more and more absolute."
NBE00634,"I think this punishment doesn't go too far. I think punishment should be threating thing for the people who illegally download musics and movies, animes and so on. If punishment is weak, these people won't stop doing it. Panishment is absolute. Therefore the order is followed."
NBE00635,want to lose the opportunity to write Kanji by hand. Each Kanji has meaning and they
NBE00620,"I heard that the CD's market is shrinking now because of illegal downloading. It shows that many people possess illegally downloaded music or films in Japan. Everyone has the risk that he or she is punished for illegal downloading. This is because many people can use the internet any time. Therefore, I think that the punishment is too heavy for this crime."
NBE00627,"I can't support this law. Some people think that this new low is quite effective for illegally downloaded music problem and falling music sales. But, I don't think so. The causes of falling music is that the sales of CD is reducing. When we want to listen music, we go to CD rental shop, or buy date of the music at iTunes. It's so easy and economical. If illegally download is prohibited, people will not buy CD. I think , Japanese music world have to devise different policy."
NBE00659,"Many people don't know this low. If people knew it is illegal download, people would continue to download many music and movie. In order to avoid this, mass communication should broadcast that there are many people who was punished by illegal download in Japan."
NBE00677,"I do not see any advantages in making a law for illegal downloads. The move is said to stop falling music sales but in my opinion, people who buy CDs and DVDs in the first place will buy it even if there is a law for illegal downloads or not. It will not make the people who do not buy CDs to go out to the CD store."
NBE00676,"I could not find a comment which I ""strongly"" disagree with, but I disagree with the last part of this comment. If the infringer were to pay for what they downloaded, they should have done that in the first place. As the infringers know that what they are doing is wrong, I think there is nothing wrong with it. But I do agree that it is quite a ridiculous figure."
NBE00686,Regulating illegal downloads is necessary. But I didn't expect pirates are spread such a high rate. It was a big surprise that only 1% is downloaded legally in China. Illegal is Bad. Great effect would be expected with this new law.
NBE00684,"I disagree to this comment because I think the act of downloading illegally can mean the music of film doesn't have a value to pay money. Even though I wish CDs and DVDs were cheaper, I still think the prise is fair because there are many people who worked to make the CDs and DVDs. I think people should pay money to those things feeling thankful of their work. So if they made the fine too cheap I think it could be rude to the people who makes CDs and DVDs including celebrities."
NBE01863,"I think most people don't realize that downloading free music will be punished. This problem won't be solved because it is very convenience and do not use any money. In fact , I did it 3 or 4 times but I never do this act any more because there are many people who are in trouble."
NBE06412,"This is a very very famous topic. Why?Because, we often look the TV news about illegally downloads. However, Why don't illegally downloads disappear?humans would like to do that they want to do. I think that it is difficult that illegally downloads disappear."
NBE06087,"I agree with you. I often use internet for watching movie on youtube and listening music. However I don't know it is an illegal act. A lot of people use internet for watching movies and listening music like me. Almost people does not download movies and music. It's difficult to understand a law for the general people, so I think it's better to increase more chances to learn a law."
NBE02210,Music industry might need a fundamental change with the expanse of Internet use. I mean it is pretty hard to get rid of the download pirates so it can be more practical to change the way to make money.
NBE02234,"I think that it was too late to have made this law. Many wonderful artists are in Japan, for example AKB48 and Arashi. However, compared with ancient times, the sales of CD are decreasing clearly. It is a very sad thing. I also know the site which can perform illegal download. If they are exterminated, CD sales of Japan will increase. I am wishing this law is successful like France or South Korea also in Japan."
NBE01926,"I think that this law is ineffective. Japanese wants to music plus alpha to CD. This is a difference with Korea. For example, one of the biggest reasons why CD sells is ""handshake ticket"" in Japan now. I think that a market becomes small if the government strengthens regulation to downloading. Different means are necessary as well as regulation to protect a market."
NBE02577,"The new Japanese law will activate music market because increasing number of music illegally downloaded has damaged CD industry. In my opinion, the law is needed. And I'm surprised at the vast number of downloaded music in China. I'm sure this will ruin Chinese music market."
NBE02866,"This law has played an important role in preventing people from downloading music illegally. The law has reconfirmed that piracy is the serious crime enough to be arrested. for example, before the law was established, I had often downloaded music from YouTube by using conversion software. thanks to the law, I have stopped downloading music free. However, Japanese law has been obscure whether it is legal or illegal when people download music. Therefore, I propose that Japanese law should order Internet providers to send notices to users as Korean law do."
NBE02865,"I think that it was good for Japanese government to enact a low about illegally downloads . However, as you know, the number of people who download musics and films illegally has not been decreasing . this is because the law Japanese government has enact is not detailed , so people in Japan are not afraid of it . Moreover, only a few people are arrested ! So Japanese government should enact a more detailed low as American government do so ."
NBE00365,"I deplore giving the damage to cultural heritage. To reduce defacement such an incident, I think not only security should be reinforced but also should execute felony."
NBE00368,"I hope that the Tate Gallery will remedy that painting as soon as possible. It must be very sad incident for Rothko and his Family. He may be crying in heaven. By the way, in order to prevent such a tragedy from now on, the gallery have to strengthen its security and at the same time, the criminals have to be strictly punished, as ID12055 said."
NBE00371,"I think it is terrible that worthy wall paintings are damaged and they need to be fixed as soon as possible. Not only me but also many people all over the world are feeling the same way, I guess."
NBE00374,"I got angry with this news. I thought the culprit wanted to be famous in the society by doing such a thing, but I can't understand why he thought so. It's just a mad way. I can't forgive him. Anyway, i hope the Gallery will do the best to recover it."
NBE00377,"I cannot believe the action which the idiot man has made. What on earth did he do? What made him do such a thing? Public assets are, as everyone including small child know, the things for all the people. I hope such a shocking incident won't happen again. And the appropriate measurement is needed. It's an urgent matter."
NBE00380,"I think that Tate Gallery should remedy that painting immediately. And I also think we should think and carry out the measures in order to prevent the incident like this. So, It connects with prevention of the incident like this."
NBE00383,I think that administration should be strengthen to the museum. Past work of art is so beautiful and high values. So we must leave past work of art in the future. I hope so.
NBE00387,"I think that painting gallery especially cultural heritages are not permissible. In order to prevent such actions, it is very important for us to improve the security toward many acts."
NBE00390,"Now all the Tate Modern can do is restoring the painting that was defaced by vandalism, I think. I believe that it was bad defenses for paintings in the gallery. Besides the gallery has to build up glasses and walls so that we protect other paintings and artistic things. It is because they are legacies for the future people and the world's fortunes. The gallery must protect other artistic things."
NBE00393,"I oppose to deface the art works from two reasons. First, the art is very important for the artist and owner. They must feel sad to hear that. So we have to distinguish good from evil in common sense of morality, I think. Second, many arts are valuable and healing for us because they make our life wealthy. I went to Bridgestone museum in Tokyo in these days, I really enjoyed appreciating the exhibit there. The experience gave me many knowledges and ideas of life. We must love the works and treat them very carefully."
NBE00396,"I can't understand what's called ""vandalism"". People have different values and often it's difficult to experience empathy with values completely different from oneself. Even so, we can at least recognize that there are various values around us; nevertheless, go so far as attack on works of art should be irrational. To be sure, works of art sometimes strongly reflect political or regional ideology. Considering there are also people just enjoy ""art"", however, whatever political or other intentions vandal may have, they should not damage works of art."
NBE00398,"I strongly believe that the vandal is not pardoned. If he would like to send a message to other people and want to leave the message, he would be able to send and leave the message by the other way. For example he run the painting in the his account on SNS. We have the right to freedom expression. But we use the right as long as we go against the public welfare. It is natural that we must not deface other people's thing. According to the other article, he would like to make the painting famous and want many many people to look at the painting. But due to his behavior, the painting cannot be exhibited for the remedy of the damage. So he should take the responsibility of the vandalism and he should think over the way of conveying his feeling."
NBE00400,"I was surprised that the famous painting defaced by a man. I knew the different news that one lady changed a famous painting in order to fix it because of old. I couldn't understand why he defaced that painting. Famous paintings should be seen by many people in the world, and people should feel what is the real beauty from paintings. Tate Gallery should put watchmen in front of paintings and they should prevent these accident again."
NBE00402,"Of course, a man who defaced painting(mural) deserves to be infamous, I think the Tate gallery also has a problem. Galleries should prepare for any incident however, The incident occurred in the Tate gallery showed the weakness of secure of the Tate gallery. In my opinion, The Tate gallery should pay damage to the artist's family also, the gallery have a responsibility to restore paintings employing professionals."
NBE00404,The strange accident is just funny for people who don't interest in art like me. However artists may be angry when they hear the news. I think painting should be liberty but painting is also his or her works and mass of theirs. Vandalism forget it i think.
NBE00406,"I am not really interested in arts but I strongly believe what vandal did was morally wrong. Whatever he thinks, we cannot justify damaging other people's works. If we allow what he did, it means that we are going to justify damaging other people's stuff, no matter we dislike or not. He must have been taught at school that he is not allowed to damage others. It is just the same thing. Whatever reason he had, it is morally wrong. Also, in this case, he had alternative way to express his thought. He could have used Twitter or Facebook or whatever. He should better take a good, hard look at himself and apologize to painter's family members about his act. I hope the mural will be repaired as it was and I will expect the museum to protect arts from next time."
NBE00408,"Everyone, of course, knows that they must not damage the belongings of others, as defacing other's paintings. The vandal is unforgiven. I want to understand what drove him to act the vandalism."
NBE00410,"I wonder why the suspect could fled outside in only a few minutes. I guess the museum didn't have enough number of guards to protect arts and it relied on people's moral. But that's what can't be helped. Generally museums have so many exhibits and it may be difficult for them to hire a lot of guards. I also wander why he defaced the painting before other visitors' eyes. It's unusual and seems that he acted on impulse or purpose. Seeing that the latest news article reports he was a big fan of the artist, his motive for the crime may be similar to the latter. He might want to show his preference to the painting by putting a message on it. Anyway, his selfish act against moral and law ruined the precious painting. He will be punished."
NBE00412,"I was sorry when I heard this news. I often go to museums. I think the things people left like works of art, buildings, literary works and so on are legacies of human beings. I do not know the destroyer's mind when he defaced the art. If such person appears much more, museums will strengthen the secure. Then, I think our visit become boring. So, I think conservation of heritages should depend on people's conscience."
NBE00414,"I agree with ID12063. The art objects should be protected strictly. Because they can not be restored again. They can tell us the ancient desire and feelings. We have to keep these things for the future. Needless to say, the gallery needs to strengthen the security right now. And, all visitors have to respect for these arts. I think that this is the most basic and necessary rule of the gallery."
NBE00416,The art museum need more strict guard for valuable pictures. I don't understand why he damaged the picture . It should not be forgiven.
NBE00418,"I agree with ID12063's comment. I want the gallery remedy the painting. The event was not good thing to Rothko and people who like the painting of Rothko. Because of the event, I think that the gallery should make staff to stand in front of the paintings to protect them. I hope those events will not happen again."
NBE00420,"I agree with ID12034 about ""Vandalism. "" It's impossible to tell and share how one feel to others. The guy who did this might feel this art is rubbish. Like other people ave commented, I wish Tate Gallery will remedy the painting as much as possible. Also, I think other gallery should think about how their security should be, and how they could change it to protect art."
NBE00422,Not only Tate Modern but other art museums would have to think of a countermeasure to these problems. I can't understand why he did such a thing but I hope there are no other accidents like this.
NBE00425,"I regret that the painting was defeated. Artworks must be protected by everything because they are fortunes their own. The museum should be strengthen securities. For example, they increase the number of guards."
NBE00427,"I think this case is rare. I don't know why the vandal defaced the painting. It is not good to deface art works, whatever the reason is. Art works is not for one but for everyone."
NBE00429,"I can not understand what for the vandal did such a thing, and what made him do so. He has a right to think anything, but doesn't have it to trouble somebody. I hope the accident like this won't happen again, and the museum should improve the security."
NBE00431,"Though I'm not familiar with arts, I think what the vandal did must not be permitted. Of course the gallery will remedy the condition, but it will not be restored to its former state. I wonder whether the gallery secured works fully. I think that security of works is one of the most important tasks of galleries."
NBE00433,"As our society is being more and more convenient, we become to live easily. However, in accord with it, we are losing important abilities. The ability to write ""Kanji"" is one of examples of them. If we have some trouble in writing words, we would forget how to write characters. This is undesirable situation for passing Japanese cultures to the next generation."
NBE00435,"I think this incident is so terrible. Someone who defaced this art do this crime just for fan. But, he must not such a vicious joke. I can't understand Mark Rothko's art. However, so many people who love Rothko's art must be sad. This museum have to restore the picture immediately."
NBE00437,"Writing graffiti is a impermissible conduct. There are sorts of them, such as graffiti in public conveniences, temples, and walls of houses. And weight of these crimes is different. I guess that those who write graffiti in temples or famous paintings want to be recognized his/her existence and self-display, or want to get a thrill from their actions. I don't know the psychology of the criminal of this case. However if we have frustrations and aggressiveness, we should restrain them. In the final count, these actions are strictly regulated by law."
NBE00439,"I was sad to hear this story. It is said that the work is the part of himself for artist, so the culprit is very terrible. Recently, the graffiti on the World Heritage or wounded corals are saw and took up as problem, I think increasing people who can't think the beauty is beautiful is very sad and big problem for the next generation."
NBE00441,"I think this is very terrible incident, this news made me sad. I can't understand why men who are vandal do destroy the cultural things. I wonder they didn't the feelings of artist or those who protects the works. We have to have a consciousness that we have responsibility of protecting cultural things or paintings and so on, these are the crystal of human talent. I wish all of people love the culture."
NBE00443,"I think vandalism is a very serious crime. Works of art are things we inherit from previous generations, and we must hand those down to the next generation. If someone hurt works like this incident, those pieces of art can no longer be left to the next generation. I think each person must recognize their roles, and we should protect them."
NBE00445,"Paintings are not capable of being duplicated. It is the only one. The same paintings never exist. I wonder why the suspect has conducted such a terrible thing, but also I do not understand why the vandalism was easily conducted. Therefore, I think the security of the museum should be more stiff."
NBE00447,"I heard this news and felt it shocking. vandalism is a very serious crime. It is because the same fine-arts work is never made. Therefore, I think that this incident is an important problem. In order to prevent the repetition of an offense, the art museum should further keep watch severely."
NBE00449,I think it is terrible that worthy wall paintings are damaged. I guess the value of this wall painting would decrease because of the graffiti. This news was sad for me.
NBE00451,First of all I thought I have to read more books because I didn't know the artist. Also I noticed it's good for me to go to museum for cultivate myself.
NBE00688,"I think this is a horrible news. Of course the person who damaged the picture is blamed mostly, But I think that the way of preserving the art was bad too. Comparing to the Japanese museum, the foreign museum does not treat them neat. I think it is important to reinforce the security."
NBE00690,"Vandalism is really sad thing. It is not good to modify arts except when restoration has been needed. But there was an example which failed in restoration of pictures in Spain. Although she was not intended, it became somewhat different from an original picture. In the end, what she did is vandalism. We should have left it as it was."
NBE00692,"I think this kind of accident happened because there weren't enough security to save the picture. In Japan, museum is strictly secured so I think this kind of accident wouldn't happen. When I went to museum abroad, the impression I got was not secured enough which was opposite to my expectation. If there are something important in the museum, the owner should do their best to protect the it."
NBE00694,i feel really sorry for rothko and hope that his painting will remedy as soon as possible. and i think museum should put more guards to protect paintings and other articles.
NBE00696,I wonder how much money did museum spend to remedy the defaced painting. I think the criminal must compensate all the money the museum spend and this kind of news shouldn't happen again.
NBE00698,"I do not understand at all why the man has done such thing. The exhibit which got defaced is not just an art but the fruit of the artist's efforts, sweat and tears. It can be said that the action of defacing the painting actually broke his heart and I feel very sorry for him. To prevent this kind of crime, it is necessary for every art gallery to reinforce the security that it has."
NBE00700,"That very valued painting was tarnished is sorry. But I cannot understand the value of this painting. But I have heard the name of this painter Rothko. I can not understand why such a painting is so expensive. The word of art is hard to understand. Some day, I want to be a person who can understand art and appreciate the beauty of art."
NBE00702,"I can't understand why the man defected the Rothko's painting. Even if he didn't like the art, his vandalism was wrong with the judge as a human being. Of cause, I think everyone have each thought, ideal and religion. . . . . . but, there are what we shouldn't do actually. His way to express was wrong, because it gave hurt to people including Rothko's children emotionally. I hope that the Tate Gallery will remedy that painting as soon as possible. However, the fact that the painting was defected will be not remedy."
NBE00704,"For such a crime, museum strengthen security. As a result, we cannot enjoy looking at the paintings at close range. Many people want to watch the details and appreciate pictures easily. So we should protect pictures in the way that don't hurt splendor of the art"
NBE00706,"It is terrible that worthy wall paintings are damaged and they need to be fixed as soon as possible. Many people all over the world as well as I are feeling the same way, I think"
NBE00708,"It's sad that a great work of art was vandalized. I want to know why the person did so. If he did that simply as a prank, it couldn't be allowed, but somehow I think there is any other reason."
NBE00710,"I think it is terrible incident. Tate Gallery should remedy this situation immediately, and do the best to prevent from occurring the incident like this again."
NBE00712,"I can't understand such a stupid action. This crime is difficult to protect. Because the motive is wonder. To protect such crime, there is only way, strengthening the guard of art museum."
NBE00714,"I think vandalism occurs because of a lack of education and communication within international society. Firstly, artistic things and cultural assets are valued by public and society. People who commit vandalism usually do not recognize (approve of) the communal value of art. In many case, they give their own negative meaning to the art. Some vandalism occurs in a political way. The people who commit vandalism in a political way give their own independent meaning to cultural assets. For example, in 2001, the Taliban destroyed the Bamyan Buddha in 2003, appealing to international society to accept their political will. In this case, they treat cultural assets as a means to achieve their will. Secondly, international society needs much negotiation and conversation to protect cultural assets. A cultural asset which is maintained by one country is not exclusively owned by that country. This means a cultural asset, even if technically/theoretically maintained by one country, is practically/in reality for everybody who lives on this earth, both now and in the future. According to this logic, The Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict was adopted at The Hague (Netherlands) in 1954. It covers immovable and movable cultural heritage, including monuments of architecture, art or history, archeological sites, works of art, manuscripts, books and other objects of artistic, historical or archeological interest, as well as scientific collections of all kinds, regardless of their origin or ownership. But in spite of this kind of determination of international society, many cases of vandalism occur during periods of war. Because of this, I believe the actions of international society to protect humanity's cultural assets are not yet sufficient. Therefore, I propose to make a penalty that regulates vandalism during periods of war. Even though The Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict has a penalty, it has not yet been enforced because it is not realistic. For example, America plundered cultural assets of Iraq which were being kept in Iraqi museums. In spite of this crime, America has never apologized nor been punished."
NBE00740,"I also think that new law didn't work well. As he said, the internet is infinite world, so it is too difficult to ban the downloading completely. I agree with his idea that the company should try other way to earn. For example, giving the privilege(photos, sign, concert ticket . . ) to person who buy the CD."
NBE00716,"Everyday I hear, read, talk about many news, however this is one of the worst news I've heard recently. As many people already have said, this is such an awful news. The man has spoiled an important cultural heritage that should be protected forever. I don't understand why this man has done such a stupid thing. . . . Guess so many people all over the world is feeling the same way. The man wasn't educated enough. . . I think. Enough to have the idea to protect heritages. Anyways, I really hope that this wall paintings somehow will be fixed someday."
NBE00718,"I felt sad when I read this article. Museums must be filled with a lot of guards for preventing such foolish acts? If so, I feel sorry for people who really love art because they would not like to enjoy works of art surrounded by many obstacles."
NBE00720,I was surprised to hear the news. An action like this doesn't be forgiven. The museum should reinforce the security. and remedy the painting as soon as possible.
NBE00722,I can't understand how the criminal feel about his action. It is not forgiven. And we have to defend that action .
NBE00723,I can't understand how the criminal feel about his own action. It is not forgiven. And all art museums have to take measures to prevent such actions never occurring.
NBE06923,"I strongly agree with ID12034 from""Rothko painting defaced in London. "" It's because it's true that people have different values. For example, I can't believe that Picasso's painting are worth billion dollars. Also, latter in his/her comment said that "" they should not damage works of art. "", I think this is true as well."
NBE00725,"I don't know the name ""Rothko"" but I hear he is one of the modern artists like Picasso. Thinking about the witness, I guess how surprised he was when he saw the vandalism! I wonder why the vandal did this act. I read that he is one of the Rothko's fans. Did he love the art too match to damage the picture like the man in "" Kinkaku-ji"" which is written by Yukio Mishima?"
NBE00727,"I was really surprised to hear the news because his kind of news doesn't occur in Japan. Tate Gallery must remedy the situation. It's true that criminal is bad, but the gallery must strengthen the security."
NBE06316,I regretted it very much when I knew this news. It is outrageous to scribble on a work. It is the act that you must not do to scribble on the work of the person. The criminal who scribbled turns itself in to the police well manfully and should compensate for a crime. I pray for a criminal being caught.
NBE06533,"I strongly agree with the comment above because as it is said the works of art are the things handed down by our ancestors and and they are the only one we have in our world. No two same things will exist. So that means once you damage them you cannot recover them completely the same as it were, in other words, it is irreversible deed. So no matter what reason or justification you have, just think twice and imagine what the outcome will be."
NBE06317,I can't understand how the criminal feel about his own action. It is not forgiven. And all art museums have to take measures to prevent such actions never occurring.
NBE00729,"I can't believe the action of the man. I can't see why did he do such a stupid thing. I am not interested in art, but I know art is of great value. The paintings displayed in art museum are more than one hundred million yen. This action could be a bit hard to pot right. I hope the incident like this never happens."
NBE06135,"I felt shock when I read this article. I think that whatever reason is, this incident should not be allowed . I can't understand why the people has done such a thing. From now on, the museum guard against a dubious character more, we should guard a painting."
NBE06134,I agree with this comment. It's a mystery why this man has done such a thing. I want to hear his own comment about his own act.
NBE07146,"I was very sad to hear the news. The wall arts loved by many people and should be protected forever. However, a stupid man has spoiled it. It was too bad. I really hope that the wall arts will be remedied someday. And I think that Tate Gallery should put watchmen in front of paintings for making them more secure and preventing them from such a stupid man."
NBE06843,"When I heard this news at the first time, I was so surprised and also I felt sad about this painting. I thought many people got angry about this incident because one famous painting was defaced by a lady. However, about a few months after that news, I saw another news which I was surprised again. News went to the small town which this incident happened. Then there are many ""defaced paintings"" in everywhere in the town. Because of that news, many tourists came to this town and it brought huge amounts of positive economic effect. At first, this accident was criticized by many people, but it also brings good result soon."
NBE05937,"I don't know the name ""Rothko"" but I hear he is one of the modern artists like Picasso. Thinking about the witness, I guess how surprised he was when he saw the vandalism! I wonder why the vandal did this act. I read that he is one of the Rothko's fans. Did he love the art too match and damage the picture like the man in "" Kinkaku-ji"" which is written by Yukio Mishima?"
NBE06870,This news is terrible. I think any art is only one in the world and art makes people have many strong emotion. Art museum security should be more strict to protect precious art.
NBE00730,I find it quite sad that some people cannot understand the value of artistic properties. Another thing shocked me was that victim planed to do such thing by having a painting brush ready to carry it out.
NBE07075,It was a really shocking news. Vandalism of old great arts is incomprehensible. It makes other people uncomfortable and you can say it is luck of respect. I wish it would not occur such a foolish action again.
NBE00356,"I can't believe the painting was defaced at the museum is famous around the world. Tate modern is large museum, so the security becomes more strictly. We should prevent arts from people who don't understand the value of them."
NBE00731,"I wondered what made this accident's culprit write such a foolish doodle. He might have been very angry and reasonless in that time, and I understand that art is not valuable for some people, but it was not allowed to deface this product. So I think that the culprit cannot be allowed, and I hope the tate museum will be more carefully."
NBE00829,"I think that EU is not appropriate for Nobel Peace Prize. It is too early. It is the truth that EU was established for keeping out any wars and this purpose has been fulfilled for 60 years. However we must not forget that EU also holds some countries which suffer for the financial crisis. In fact, we can see a lot of demonstrators in these countries. EU should strive to solve this issue before being awarded the Prize, or peace in EU will not be kept for a long time."
NBE00789,I think the award is just joke because EU caused depressions from Greece and it leads the world to bad world. I think America and Japan also keep the peace. I agree eurosceptics.
NBE00796,"I disagree with the Nobel peace prize's winner of this year. I think Nobel Peace Prize should be admitted to be peaceful by people all over the world. But this case, people even in the EU criticizes about the prize, such as eurosceptics. Moreover the word of ""peace"" ought to have the only one meaning, so I believe these wide way of thinking about recipient is wrong."
NBE00776,"I think Nobel Prize should be sent to individuals rather than organization. Sometimes many people contribute to common feat together and it's hard to decide who is the best and deserved. As a result, an organization not an individual is awarded. But this decision may not do good to both those who were involved in the feat and the idea of Nobel Prize itself. Firstly, individuals' achievements were hidden by too broad and vague achievement of an organization. For instance, EU's contribution to Europe and the world peace is made up of many individuals' achievements such as breaking the dictatorship. Even if EU awards the Nobel Prize, they cannot attract people's attention. Their feats may not be revealed to people in the world. On the contrary, If a individual awards the Nobel Prize, at least one of their achievements is in the spotlight. Secondary, some organizations utilize Nobel Prize as a propaganda to boost their confidence. Policy of a country is one of the most polarizing issues and many people may not agree to the award. In reality, some praise the EU's contribution to Europe and the world peace while other criticize it even in the member of the EU. And in such a situation, the organizations are only self-satisfied with the award. So I believe Nobel Prize should go to only individuals."
NBE00825,"Like other people said, I think EU is not appropriate for Nobel Peace Prize. They were given the prize because they had no war for 60 years, but I think there are other countries where they don't have war for longer than 60 years. Also, like some people mentioned, EU is the one who lead Economic Crisis. There were lot of demos toward government. I'm not so sure that leading Economic Crisis and Demos are ""Peace. "" Also, some people said that Prize should be given to independent, but I think organization also have right to earn the Prize."
NBE00837,"I don't think EU deserves Nobel Peace Prize. Though it's admirable that EU had no war for 60 years, we should not say that only such a thing is required for Peace. Because of the recent world wide depression, many people and countries are suffering from financial problem. European countries are some of the most struggling countries in the world. Due to this problem, it's easily assumable that people are loosing their jobs. How can we call that such countries peaceful?"
NBE00823,"I agree with ID12063's comment. I do not think that EU deserves the prize. The prize was given because European countries had no war for 60 years, but I think it is strange because we must not cause a war any more. Therefore, it does not matter whether 60 years have passed. We do not care about that how many years we live without war. We just need to think about not causing a war again."
NBE00830,I don't think that EU deserves to win the Nobel Peace Prize because 60 years of peace in Europe is not special. WWII damaged Europe seriously. Therefore EU didn't have plenty of energy left over for starting new war.
NBE00831,"As other people had said, I don't think EU suits to Nobel Peace Prize. Keeping out war is a thing that must be done everywhere around the world and it is not a special thing. There are still many problems are happening in Europe countries and they have to correspond to these problems."
NBE00801,"I think this is not worthy to recognize. I agree the Nobel Peace Prize only go to individuals. This recognition look like a performance of politics. And, I think the Nobel Peace Prize should only go to individuals because the Nobel Peace Prize go to a person who contributes to the peace of the world. If the frame of government receive the prize, this means criticizing the others. And, this will connect a thought which winner is always right."
NBE00778,"Shameful talk, I didn't know that EU have won the Nobel Peace Prize. I think the Nobel Peace Prize should not only go to individuals but also to organization and so on, because Peace can be protected by everyone. So it's difficult to won the Nobel Peace Prize, but I want to do something for world peace."
NBE00797,"Some critics say the reason why EU got the award of the 2012 Nobel Peace Prize is that it will encourage European countries to tackle with the difficulties they are facing now, such as economic crisis. There's no denying that it is a good thing to encourage individuals or organizations to strive hard, but is there any justification for the Nobel Peace Prize to do so? I don't think so. Nobel Peace Prize should be separate from the political or economical matter happening in the country or in the world. They should focus only on whether the deed of the actor is appropriate for being commended. Using this argument, I also disagree with when President Barack Obama was awarded the Peace Prize in the matter of contribution to the peace of Afghanistan. He hasn't really done anything to the peace of Afghanistan ( some say he made Afghanistan more dangerous place) and at this time the prize was awarded just as an encouragement as well. So what I would like to say is that I certainly agree with the fact that some EU countries have contributed to settle down some of the conflicts they had, it was just an outcome of the history, and there's no justification and it is unfair for EU to achieve the prize because while individual or NGO activists routinely make sacrifices and take huge risks to do make the peaceful world, EU are paid to do so."
NBE00777,"I am not an European, but Japanese, therefore I do not understand what affairs EU is now confronted with, and what it has really brought Europe. I have so poor knowledge that I am not able to express my opinion about this issue. I have to learn more about it. Anyway I do not care whether Nobel Peace Prize should go to such institutions as EU, or individuals. As Mario Monti says, the prize, I hope, will encourage EU to overcome the current economic difficulties."
NBE00785,"I like EU, so I was happy when I was heard the news EU got the Nobel Peace Prize. In fact, I can understand some critics against this incident, but you can't deny the role of EU for peace in Europe. The cooperation between many countries, as EU has done, is very important for achieving the international peace, I think. What EU did is precious the ""history"". We have to learn them, both good things and bad things."
NBE00786,"In the first place, the Nobel Prize is awarded to the best of contributor in the each field. In other words, this prize is awarded to the person. Nobel thought that this prize should be awarded regardless of countries and nations. But is this winning prize against Nobel's will? So I think that the Nobel Prize is awarded to the person not to the organization. Furthermore, I have some doubts about this winning the prize. One of the doubts is the reason why EU is awarded the Nobel Prize. The reason why the EU is awarded is that, as the article written, the EU in recognition of 60 years without war and for encouraging EU governments and people to press forward, ""overcoming the current economic difficulties. "" But it is strange. Firstly, most of democratic countries haven't made wars since WWII. EU side will talk about the relationship between France and Germany especially. But there were tense situation between countries such as Japan and China. Both countries also haven't gone to war. Secondly, winning the prize is strange for only overcoming the economic crisis. First of all, economy is not related to the Piece. And also there were a lot of countries which are facing the crisis. This award is against Nobel's will that should not support a part of countries. For these reasons I disagree with this award."
NBE00819,"I don't think that EU deserved Nobel Peace Prize. The reason of that is, no matter what people say, the present economic depressions. And I think EU's idea of integration is great, of course, but I don't think just the idea have worth of the prize. Not only that, this reception would let the value of the prize down and make me think that it is a desperate election. Sometimes, there were the years of no recipient of the prize. Causing these problems, I think not electing was better than electing forcibly."
NBE00784,"I agree that the EU was given the nobel prize. It is because there are still some wars all over the world, these days the number of the wars have been reducing, though. Many classmates disagree with this news, but I do not think so. Anything that keep a peace should be praised. I believe that the peace of the whole world is the most important thing that every people should hope. In short, the nobel organization should give the nobel peace prize to a lot of plans, organizations, and association."
NBE00805,"I disagree with the nobel peace prize of this year. Surely it is wonderful to keep being without war for 60 years. However it is a part of the EU. The EU also have bad aspects, for example economic crisis. Moreover the nobel prize should be given to only individuals, because prizing organizations is difficult and can cause many critics."
NBE00808,"I do not disagree with the fact that EU has awarded the Nobel peace prize of 2012. Some says it is not appropriate to give such a prize to the organization, but why? I think there is no doubt that the EU has contributed to keep the peace of the European continent. Think about the past! There had been wars in every generations! But, now? no more war. Is there any doubt that it has not contributed to achieve such a great thing?"
NBE00817,"I agree with the nobel peace prize for EU. I think keeping the peace for 60 years is worth receiving the prize. EU accomplish its purpose properly. I expect that this prize will make a sense of unity stronger, and function to improve the economic crises."
NBE00780,"I think this collision is being come by the absence of standard of prizing Nobel Peace Prize. Actually, it is hard to establish a standard of Peace Prize. Because Peace can be thought as both comprehensive and microscopic. However, in my personal opinion, I think the Nobel Peace Prize have to be prized by a standard based on microscopic viewpoint. Nobody would be awarded if presenting the Peace Prize based on comprehensive since there are no people who had not made a fault in their lives. Therefore, EU deserved to prize the Nobel Peace Prize."
NBE00790,"I think Nobel Peace Prize is given the man who proposed and caught out the idea which has a possibility to make everyone happy. Its aim isn't for everyone, the importance is to make many people happy, and need not any sacrifices. Now, EU can't resolve the problem of poverty, the society which can make a part of people happy is not really happy I think."
NBE00832,"I do not think the EU deserves the nobel prize as many students complaining above. They said that the EU was kept without war for 60 years. This should be appreciated, but they caused terrible problem at the same time. The depression we are struggling with now is actually caused from one of the countries of the EU. To receive the prize, they should have solved the problem and been perfect."
NBE00781,"I can't understand why EU was awarded Nobel Peace Prize. I don't think that EU contributed peace of world. On the contrary, EU confused the world economy by financial crisis. But, I agree organization are awarded Nobel Prize. Because, I think many kind of method for peace have to be evaluated."
NBE00771,"I think it is unconvinced that EU was awarded Nobel Peace Prize. I don't think EU didn't contribute peace of world entirely, but it is abstract and i don't understand how EU contribute."
NBE00792,"I think it is important to cooperate with other people to tackle some problems. But once the group became powerful, people in it apt to think their own profit. I don't think that is just. We should be careful not being so."
NBE00822,"No war for 60 years in Europe is valuable. But I don't know this is worth awarding as a Nobel Peace Prize. That because I can't understand the criterion of awarding . I think some people are worth awarding it, but others which I didn't think they had done enough services award it. So I think the value of the Nobel Peace Prize is getting less."
NBE00804,"As many eurosceptics said, this nobel peace prize for EU may exaggerate it's achievements. If the prize winner was an individual, we could see a consistent policy or so. But a big organization as EU, people can't be sure which to focus on it's accomplishments. The Nobel committee should show more concrete reason for people assent for it."
NBE00835,"many people disagrees about eu winning the nobel peace prize, but i think they should deserve one. as ID12048 said, no war for 60 years in eu is valuable thing so other countries should follow eu's example."
NBE00826,"No war for 60 years is good. But, I felt strange that EU got a Nobel peace prize because, EU is not only a country that without war for 60 years. It not fair."
NBE00836,"I think EU should not win the nobel peace prize because they are not ready enough. I think that the nobel peace prize should be given to the person who has completed it work which had made a good effect for world peace. These days, I think standard of the nobel prize is blurring. As I said, it should be given to the person who has completed the work. Not ti the person who has only started, like president Obama and Grameen Bank. I feel it is sad that the nobel prize is becoming something that doesn't mean anything."
NBE00828,I think EU don't deserve Nobel Peace Prize . It is not appropriate reason that EU recognition of 60 years with out war.
NBE00834,"Like most students have written in their comments, I do not think it is appropriate for the EU to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. Unfortunately, there is a fact that the economic crisis which the world is still suffering from was caused by one of the EU country. Also, I am not persuaded by the idea that they received the prize in recognition of 60 years without war. It is not quite fair for other countries which have kept their peace for more than 60 years and have caused any problems like the world depression."
NBE00783,"I think the award of EU is not strange. I would like to show two the reason. First, there have been no war theses 60 years in EU, it is worth to being praised. I studied the world history in high school, so I can understand the difficulty to keep piece there. The history of Europe is the history of wars. So, when I think the fact, This situation without wars for 60 years is wonderful. Secondly, this prize implies to expect EU to fight this danger situation of EU. Now, EU has big financial problem with Greece. I think this Nobel Prize means that cheering EU to get over it."
NBE00813,"I do not think it amusing that EU wins a Nobel Peace Prize . Because, EU is no-war for 60 years. Moreover, by having won the nobel peace prize, it is thought that the consciousness of the peace of EU will become strong from now on. Therefore, this award is good."
NBE00762,"I think the award of EU is natural. the fact that there have been no war in 60 years is so admirable. Were it not for EU, big war among countries would've fired, I guess. so it's worth to be praised."
NBE00775,"Once European countries had made war. But EU aimed stabilization of economy and developed a sense of camaraderie, and as a result, no war is going on in Europe. This is great thing, I think. Thinking of Asian countries' confrontation - such as China, North Korea, and Japan-EU's grappling is meaningful. However, not existence of war was brought not only by positive actions for peace but also by the natural course."
NBE00764,"Congratulations EU! I think it is good thing that EU got nobel prize. Though EU have tremendous problems, EU have great meaning for future. Europe is mature place. So Europe must take point. Europe is in depression because of financial difficulties of Greece and Portugal. I think EU can great job."
NBE00763,"I am for the eurosceptics. I think that EU took an important role in postwar confusion. But it should not be praised now. EU now has many problems such as economic difficulties, and it doesn't seem to have brought a peace to the world. So the award isn't deserved. Possibly the prize will encourage european people to press forward and solve the current problems. But it has nothing to do with the world peace too much. Important thing is what EU did, not what EU will do. Many people misunderstand the meaning of Nobel Peace prize."
NBE00807,"In recent years, Nobel Peace Prize tends to be awarded as a hope to the winner's success of its future (for example, Obama was awarded shortly after he was inaugurated as President). Maybe it's the same thing this time. So I think it is not something to get angry."
NBE00816,"I agree with ID12054 comment. I think EU doesn't deserve Nobel Peace Prize. Because 60 years without war is a good point but, some countries in the EU have continued economic recession. There are a lot of unemployed. EU does not deserve the prize in economic . Too early to get a prize."
NBE00770,"I disagree to the EU won the Nobel Peace Prize. Certainly, the EU's recognition of 60 years without war is really good, I think. But they forget the Cold War. After WW2, they struggled for their profits and many countries are suffered from WW2 and the Cold War. So, I think the EU should not won the Nobel Peaze Prize."
NBE00766,"I think it is inappropriately that EU win Nobel Prize. Certainly no war has happened since 60 years ago, there is many problem now, so there is possibility the safety of EU become worse. Nobel Prize shouldn't be given EU, should be given individual who tried for EU peace."
NBE00821,"I think the EU does not deserve the Nobel peace prize. It is true that countries in the EU strive to unify Europe to create a peaceful civil society and work together as a political experiment to become an example for settling peace in their countries; however, this cannot be a reason for Nobel peace prize. There are two reasons for this idea. Firstly, Alfred Nobel's will specified that the prize should be given to ""the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses. "" But it is hard to say EU has promoted peace in other countries. Fundamentally, EU is an organization for the welfare of the people who are members of EU countries. It is true that European countries are at peace because of EU. But even though unification decreased war in Europe and made peace in the European area, EU eventually turned into a hegemony. For example, EU disregarded the demands of help from Burmese pro-democracy activists many times. They requested help from the EU because dictatorship in Burma was worsening and international society did not see the gravity of the situation even though a lot of Burmese citizens were killed or sent to prison. But EU also disregarded that problem. Also, EU is responsible for destroying the Bamyan Buddha. In 2003, the Taliban destroyed the Bamyan Buddha, with the intention of appealing to international society to accept their political will and wish to negotiate with EU and UN to approve Taliban as pre-government of Afghanistan. Of course, Taliban cannot become the government of Afghanistan, and because EU and UN did not talk with them, they finally destroyed Bamyan Buddha which is precious human cultural asset. The EU and UN had to negotiate with them even though the Taliban was not recognized as the official government because they already ruled most of Afghanistan and the EU and UN needed to create a solution to protect the people of Afghanistan and the Bamyan Buddha. Secondly, the idea that EU contributed to the decline of war is wrong. According to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, in 1990 to 2004, only 4 wars occurred between countries. Aside from country-to-country war, almost every other war was civil war. The decline of war is due to the flow of international politics, not because of the EU."
NBE00768,"When I first heard that the EU have earned a nobel peace prize, I was really surprised. The reason is that the EU has played an important role during the war and also did good job to end it. However, now, the EU is having a lot of problems in economies, relationships, and so on. It is true that countries in the EU tried to unify and made some effort to do good politics. However when we think about whether EU has promoted ""Peace"" to the other countries, I can't help saying no to this question. The nobel peace prize should be given to the one who strived to promote peace all other the world. In this meaning, I don't think that the EU is appropriate for the prize to be given."
NBE00812,"Since I had thought that Nobel Prize is to be given to individuals, so this news surprised me, but I think EU deserves that Prize. This is because It is true that there have been no war in Europe for over a half-century, and Nobel Peace Prize have been given to non-individuals several times."
NBE00810,"I think the EU should not be awarded the Nobel Prize. EU scale is too large. EU does not bring economic development. Gap in Europe is larger. When the EU was able to redress the economic disparity, I admit their Nobel Prize."
NBE00798,"Certainly the European Union is trying to change Europe and the world in a peaceful way, the way to understand this isn't only one, the news showed. EU hasn't achieved the real peace yet because each country doesn't turn them face toward the same direction."
NBE00811,"I agree with the award because EU prevent a big war between countries in Europe. However, if one country has economic crisis, a lot of country will be influenced. This is a defect about Eu. As many people know, Greece has had economic crisis and country around Greece were damaged too."
NBE00800,We can imagine but we don't or will never know how the world without EU would go on and what would happen there. So I cannot know what eurosceptics say. They should recognize the value of the presence and contribution toward peace of EU.
NBE00802,"I think Nobel peace prize in the wonderful award in the world. Also EU has a right to get this award because they control European countries peacefully. This is not easy thing to do. Still now, many wars are happening around the world and many people died because of wars which make no sense. From this news, I hope people should notice about how wonderful peace is and try to make world better than now."
NBE00795,"It is pleasing that EU received Nobel peace prize. However, EU has a lot of problems which have to be solved immediately. For example, it is financial crisis. Once it occur in any country in EU, it spread all over EU countries. We have to think of the both advantages and disadvantages."
NBE00818,"First of all, the Nobel Peace Prize must not be given as a joke. I believe that before giving the prize, many people think carefully and judge that it is suitable for EU. Certainly America and Japan keep the peace, but the case of EU, there are many countries. It is not just the matter between two countries. I think this prize is suitable for EU."
NBE00824,"I strongly disagree with ID12017 from ""EU Nobel Peace Prize earns praise and ridicule"" I think it's wrong that EU had received Nobel prize because it's something natural try not to have a war between countries. I think Nobel Peace Prize should be given to individuals who did great effort to not only to prevent the war, but something more."
NBE00809,"I disagree with EU Nobel peace this time. It is true that Peace and stability may have visited the economically rich Europeans but religion of immigrants, ethnic minorities and people of the less income are sending languish in various parts of Europe. For example, Europe considers itself the cradle of human rights and democracy, has called for protection of human rights to other countries but if you wear a covering Burka called European Muslims will be fined penalties. Construction of a mosque with a minaret not allowed in countries such as Switzerland. Economic relations are controlled by the European Union is to disadvantage poor countries and developing countries of the world. In other words, economic affluence and stability of 50 years of European is obtained to snatch away the wealth of the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America. It shows the awarded EU's also the reality of the current human society is ignored."
NBE00827,i think the reason of EU got the Nobel Peace prize is not appropriate.
NBE00765,"He think it is okay that Nobel Peace Prize is given non-individuals several times. I think so too, but EU is not appropriate ""several times"". EU has many problems, so I can't overlook them."
NBE00782,"This comment says this Nobel Peace Prize is Joke. Certainly, he could thought at first it is strange to award EU which has a seriously financial problem now. However, I believe this Nobel Prize has an important mean that they want EU to deal with the terrible situation, expecting the future. I wrote detailed it the box ""Lesson review"". This comment don't understand it. So, I strongly disagree with."
NBE00779,"The word 'Peace' have to be thought as pluralistic. In other words, peace can be a real peace to some people, but not to other people. For example, one country could think that they had kept the peace by fighting against to other country. However, citizens, or countries which gave and received damage can think that it's not a peace but just a unhappiness."
NBE00794,"I agree in EU awarding a prize of the Nobel Prize. This is because EU continued keeping European peace and prosperity for 60 years. I think that the new war does not happen in Europe, and the peace is keeping. Therefore this news is a very happy thing."
NBE00772,"I also think keeping the peace for 60 years is worth receiving the prize, but individual should be respect, i think. so i strongly disagreed with this comment."
NBE00820,"I agree with this opinion because Nobel Prize is for the people who distribute the peace of the world, not peace specific area indeed. As I commented before, it is difficult to treat EU distributed peaceful of Europe area. Europe area could stay peaceful in past decades because tendency of world politics going toward decrease of wars, not because effort of EU countries resulted. Also, same as written in this comment, there is a people who criticize EU Nobel Prize as EU point out as a reason why the economic crisis occurred recently accelerated."
NBE00787,"As I wrote the comment in this article, I strongly believe that individuals have to be won the Nobel Prize not company or organization."
NBE00788,"I can't agree with Europe receiving Nobel Peace Prize. Certainly, 60 years without wars is very important thing. But there are many countries without wars more than 60 years. And regarding economic, Europe has crimes as much as wars. Europe leads world to bad situation. Europe must have responsible about that."
NBE00761,"In addition to praise the recipient's activity, the aim of Nobel Prize is to promote the act of recipient . I think this Nobel Peace Prize is thought a little differently from other Nobel Prize. This Prize for EU means that many people wants EU to unite more strongly. EU was founded after reflection of two World War and Cold War. Although more tighter connection was expected, it is hard to say this dream has come true. EU has lots of problems to solute, for example, European economic crisis. Each country has different opinions and some participating nation doubt about EU itself. In this situation, this award is thought to be a message from the world that cheer EU up."
NBE00791,"The prize praised, at the same time critics attacked it as a misplaced. I think that this critics reaction was right action. I can't agree with EU Nobel Peace Prize. After all, I didn't understand the meaning and the contents of this prize."
NBE00799,"Originally, my opinion to this article is different from his, however, his opinion is so logical and after reading his comment, I became in favor of it."
NBE00767,"I strongly disagree with this idea because EU hasn't promoted ""Peace"". This is the most important reason to be given a Nobel Peace Prize and EU hasn't done it. Don't have any reason to be deserved to given a prize"
NBE00773,"I agree with the award of 2012 Nobel Peace Prize to the EU in recognition of 60 years without war. Surely, because of the recent world depression, many people and countries in Europe were suffered from financial problem. Especially, Spain and Greece are the most struggling countries in the world and still suffered from the problem. But, I think that the award gave the EU a new responsibility to create more united, more just and stronger peace. For that, the cooperation of the EU is more and more essential. I hope that the European Union keep unifying for peace forever."
NBE00774,"I think that the EU deserves to win the Nobel Prize. It is very difficult to cooperate with other countries about economic, security, diplomacy and the judiciary and try to do that. Surely their aim has not achieved yet. But, I think that the attempt which you never have seen deserve the award."
NBE00793,"I think what is related to politics such as EU and the prime minister should not be awarded. In Japan, Prime Minister Eisaku Sato was awarded, but a secret understanding problem became appeared later. I don't think that any politician contribute the world peace without political intention. That's why I give a thought to what is concerned with politics should not be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize."
NBE00769,"Because she think about this news same as my opinion. And she suggested ""wide way of thinking"", I think this opinion is very wonderful, and I think that I want to be a person able to have the way of thinking like her."
NBE00803,"I disagree with this comment because it focuses on a point alone. To be sure, Greece and EU influenced the world's economic for negative, however, this alone can't explain it's unsuitability for the prise. Those awarded the Nobel Prizes have had faults many or few. The same thing can be said to this case. Of course EU has effects that can't be praised , on the contrary, they surely contribute to peace for its members. We should see things inclusively."
NBE00806,"I don't agree eurosceptics' opinions. The EU hasn't done anything yet, but I think the prize can put pressure on the EU's future efforts. To overcome today's aspect, the prize was necessary."
NBE00760,I think it is good for EU to receive the Nobel Prize. The Prize makes EU think that they should cooperate with each other stronger. This effect is good for the World Peace.
NBE00814,"I disagree with this opinion. I think EU isn't entitled to Nobel Peace Prize and there are no wars in Japan, too. I think there are many people who are more entitled this prize in the world."
NBE00815,"This news is very nice. But, I can't understand EU contributes to world peace. Certainly, it is very important there has been no wars in EU for 60 years. Nowadays, there are very few wars of between countries in the world."
NBE00833,Everyone probably thought the same thing but I also think that the EU are worthy of the nobel prize as theres nothing special to it. They should not be any war in the first place.
NBE00838,"In my opinion, EU Nobel Peace Prize is valuable to prosper countries and enhance connection between EU nations. Reward is happy to everyone. I hope cloth countries cooperate with each other and raise more able for award."
NBE06315,"I agree with the opinion that Nobel Prize should be given to individuals rather than organizations. Today, some people say Nobel Prize should be given to the constitution of Japan. I'm against to this. This background has many purposes which are concerned to political problems. I think Nobel Prize should be given to individuals who actually contribute to society"
NBE00853,"I strongly object to the sentence of six Italian seismologists. It's true they failed to predict the large earthquake and some of people acted on the false information that they gave. However, a-six year prison and $17.7 million fine are too excessive. It's impossible for today's scientific technology to forecast natural disaster completely, especially earthquake or eruption. Usually, scientific techniques are testified so many times in order to ensure the safety and improve the accuracy. But large earthquake and eruption rarely occur and that means there a fewer chance to testify the techniques. So it's too severe punishing the scientists just because they failed to predict the earthquake. Furthermore, heavy penalties for false prediction can give bad effect on development of science. If some judges take a similar line, scientists are allowed to speak only collect things. Then scientists become likely to refrain from predicting unknowns for fear of being punished. Also young people avoid entering such area of science and consequently the number of researchers will decrease. So, severe penalties for false prediction can be blow to the growth of branches of science exploring unknowns. I hope the seismologists will turn out to be innocent and the scientific freedom will be ensured."
NBE00874,"I think that the sentencing of six Italian seismologists should not be permitted. There are two reasons. First, scientific freedom is the most important of this problem. The evidence of it is ""freedom of expression"". All the people must have ""human rights"" that we have gained and possessed historically. Second, science has a possibility of developing our life. If some scientists who make a mistake by chance are punished, it must weaken their strong desires to study. That means our life quality will go down. So I think people who receive the the result of scientific research should be more carefully."
NBE00855,"It is improper that six Italian seismologists have been punished. Earthquakes are natural phenomenon, so it is difficult to predict it. The other seismologists fare that predicting earthquakes. We should protect ourselves without the other people's help. Anyway, when a earthquake occurs, we must act quickly."
NBE00879,"According to this article, six seismologists were sentenced six years in jail and ordered to pay more than nine million euros ($11.7 million). This is too strict for them I think. Science are changing and developing every each day. All scientists have rights to study and research new technology and this is scientific freedom. Not only the case of science but also other subjects, this right of freedom is existed. Italia should rethinks about this problem and also possibility of scientific field."
NBE00854,"This news shocked me very much. The prediction of an earthquake, when to happen and how strong it will be, is not absolute. Therefore the scientists should not be blame for it. As Michael Halpern emphasizes, scientists need to, or have to announce what they know without feeling fear of being charged if their knowledge is not right. I think, in general when a disaster happens, people are apt to make it clear who is responsible for it, and accuse them of it. As a case in point, in Japan, when 3.11 earthquakes occurred, the public and media criticized Tokyo-Electric Power Company and governments, as if they had caused all the disaster including the earthquake."
NBE00885,"I think that it is not good to pronounce scientists to prison sentences. Because it is natural for them to explore unknowns. If they are targeted by the verdict, they will search for many things which we do not know. I regard this situations as depriving the right to speak freely and independently. Provided this conditions are going to continue, I think that big epoch-making results will appear for a long time, so this time's ridiculous judgment should reconsider at once."
NBE00878,"I think six scientists are innocent because nobody knows the power of nature. If officials make an error about measures of natural accident and some people killed in the accident, the officials may be guilty. Because it considers a man-made disaster. In Japan, we had a hot discussion about this problem 3.11. I think a nuclear plant accident on 3.11 is a man-made disaster because the government could not show off a correct information."
NBE00895,"I think these scientists should be discharged. No matter how better the technology improve, human beings can't manipulate nature. Therefore, though scientists expect disasters, it is nonsense that the government put the blame on them. Not only that, this will cause depressions of science. I hope that the judgment will be overturned and they will keep on their studies."
NBE00881,I was very surprised at this news. It is impossible for humans to predict a earthquake correctly. So six scientists have no responsible. Such a thing won't cause good correspond. Italian should face this thing seriously. .
NBE00856,"It is ridiculous to sentence scientists due to a misprediction of natural phenomena. They have a responsibility to evacuate people from a danger area even when they predict little chances of danger. Scientists will blamed by people even if they do not evacuate people since people will be disappointed with scientist's decision. This collision makes scientists to be in a dilemma. However, citizen's security is the most important thing to be protected. Therefore, scientists could not be blamed."
NBE00875,"I strongly believe that to sentence the seismologists in jail and to fine them are too heavy punishment. It is true that the seismologists are to be blamed for their statements because they are the one of the only ones who can scientifically analyze or make a caution about the earthquake ( People are less likely to have knowledge about future earthquake). However, sentencing them in jail and fining them cannot be justified in terms of the right of freedom of expression. Everyone has the right to speak freely in public ( I don't include hate speech in this case) and without the right to speak freely and independently, the both sides, scientists and moderate people or people in public, would turn into chaos. In scientists case, for example, any new innovation such as more precise prediction of earthquake or weather forecasting or research into new drugs etc will be pushed off, which means that we cannot make any invention. In public case, for example, without having opportunity to gain new information about natural disaster, even it is difficult to predict or not, people will lack in information, and in extreme case, democracy which is assuring the freedom of expression will be infringed and will collapse. So considering from these arguments, I strongly oppose to the court."
NBE00862,"Probably, Italy is going to secure the academic freedom. Most of countries, especially developed countries, secure academic freedom. Academic freedom is that any scholars, specialists can express and publish their research freely. Of course, there is asymmetry of information for science between scientist and ordinary people. But just because they have a lot of scientific knowledge it doesn't follow that they are prosecuted even if they publish the wrong opinion. They have great influence on their society. But their opinions are ""one opinion"". They also have a mistake. This is because they are not omniscient and omnipotent. As long as Italy protects academic freedom, scholars and specialists don't have to be sentenced. Secondly, the seismologists were sentenced by published that the earthquake does not happen. However, the announcement was published as the government's view. Why do the only seismologists have to take liability of the announcement? If they were prosecuted by the announcement, the government also should take responsibility of publishing the wrong opinion. The government just replaced the miss with the seismologists. So the government should apologize to the citizen for this case."
NBE00859,"In my perspective, I disagree that scientists who misjudge the risk of an earthquake will be sentenced. It is because if scientists do not have the right to speak what they research freely and independently, they cannot share what they examine in addition to becoming meaningless of the research. Then that will prevent and decrease the progress of science. Besides, no one can predict when an earthquake would happen in the future, as the article said. In short, the scientists may be not guilty. In addition, Italy should concern how to recover the damage and treat the victims rather than the punishment of the scientists. It is because the most important thing for a democracy country is the nation. Besides, the scientists are probably innocent. However, Italy said that the scientists should be sentenced. I wonder what is ""little risk of damage"" that is in this news though. Obviously, this quake is very big; not little risk of damage. But if 50 people died of a quake, is that a big risk or little risk? And who decides whether a quake is little risk or not? The borderline between little or not is pretty vague; different people. So, scientists should not be sentenced."
NBE00904,It is impossible for me to understand the Italian scientists and a government official were sentenced to six years in jail for underestimating the risk of a 2009 earthquake. It is natural that scientist's expectation often prove wrong. I think that is Science.
NBE00900,"Like other people said, I also disagree with 6 year sentence and $11.7 million fine to Italian scientist and government official. Our technology is not developed enough to completely predict what would happen in future, especially if that is environmental disaster. The government should always be ready for such disaster, and it's not right to sentence these six people. I wonder if these scientists predict there will be big disaster in near future, could government be prepared for that. For example, in Japan, scientist warned that there will be big earthquake. However, Japanese government didn't prepare for such disaster and caused lot of problem after 3.11."
NBE00911,"It will not be possible that science can predict perfectly every natural disaster. It's just some opinions what scientists say, and it's depend on each person what they believe. I had thought like that. However, through the conversation in the last class, I came to think that we have no choice but to believe what the professionals say if we have no idea about specialist things. And professionals must know that we need their knowledge. Although the punishment of this time may be too hard for them, they have to have responsibility about their statements."
NBE00899,"I think that it is impossible to predict when the earthquake occurs, even the seismologists because earthquake is a natural disaster. If people can predict when the natural disaster happens, a great number of people would survive when the huge earthquake happened on 11th of March 2011. It is impossible for them to estimate, so I think it is ridiculous that the seismologists were sentenced to six years in jail. I want them to be released from jail."
NBE00861,I do not agree with the verdict that Italian court did. It was a fact that the prediction scientists showed caused great damage. However scientists are very week against the power. The freedom of description is must been protected strictly. So I disagree against the punishment for scientists.
NBE00865,"It is the world-shaking event I think. We can't understand technical matters, so we should believe the statement of specialist stuff. But after the matter like this, we don't know to do for our safety and will do wrong treatment. I think specialist stuff should have responsibility about their statement and their technical fields. And investigations should keep the peace and safety of the people."
NBE00889,"I was very surprised to hear this news story. Of course, the scientists were scapegoats to take the responsibility. If they were sent to jail for some years, Japanese scientists should be imprisoned for over ten years or forever. No one can predict when the earthquake happens. I am consent at this opinion. Nobody understands a natural disaster. I think that an earthquake cannot be predicted similarly. It should be thrown into prison although there is some responsibility."
NBE00906,"I was very surprised to hear this news story. Of course, the scientists were scapegoats to take the responsibility. If they were sent to jail for some years, Japanese scientists should be imprisoned for over ten years or forever. No one can predict when the earthquake happens."
NBE00857,I can't support this verdict. I think that this six Italian scientists must be found innocent and acquitted. They only announced their own research and earthquake reduction. They haven't done anything wrong.
NBE00849,I think it is not adequate that six Italian seismologists have been punished. Because it is difficult to predict earthquake damage. But I want seismologists to make an effort to analyze earthquake damage.
NBE00897,"To predict the change of nature , such as earthquake is extremely difficult. So it is not apt to blame scientists. Earthquake is difficult to predict, so we should beware and prepare for it. Furthermore , we could say that it is important to do an accurate judgment which was not done at the 3.11."
NBE00871,"I think the punishments are too harsh. It is impossible to expect a natural phenomenon perfectly, and it is the seismologist itself that is primarily disappointed rather than ours. Probably those who believe the scholar's idea in the back also decrease in number, I consider that it means they receive punishment enough."
NBE00880,"Firstly, it's obvious that scientists are never prophets. If scientists were punished when they couldn't predict perfectly what happens in the future, who on earth want to be a scientist. Then, I'd like to see whether there were irrational purpose of Italian government, or, in fact, they hadn't prepared much for a big disaster so they turned their responsibility to those scientists. It's just possible that lots of people may hit upon this idea. If so, Italian government may lose their trust. I strongly think that governments should always be neutral and have some degree of cleanness for their nation."
NBE00903,"I agree with ID12055 and ID12063's opinion. Nobody foresee the future perfectly. Needless to say, all researchers are human. Also human cannot avoid making mistakes. This judgment will restrain Italian researchers from research fully and the research of Italy will fall behind. This judgment should be reconsidered as soon as possible. However, researchers need to realize their responsibility. The general public tends to rely on them at the time of emergency. For safety of nation, they must not act irresponsibly."
NBE00909,"i was very surprised when i read this news. And i still cannot believe why did they have to go to jail and need to pay nine million euro. As it said on this news, i think it is scientist's job to tell what they know to other people who do not know."
NBE00894,"I don't think the Italian six scientists have to be punished. Scientists always explore and foresee many things what may happen. It is natural works for scientists, I think. Also in Japan, after the 3.11, I have heard many forecasts about earthquakes. I think the scientists' forecasts make people prepare for the worst, and the preparations make people be safe."
NBE00905,There is no need of a scientist if people know whats going to happen in the future. Scientists job is to guess what could happen and they are not a prophet. This punishment is too strict and it is a shame for the scientists.
NBE00908,"It is totally ridiculous that the six scientists were punished for underestimating the risk of an earthquake. No one can ever predict what happens especially when it is a natural disaster. If those six could estimate exactly how strong an earthquake is or what time, no one would have died in an earthquake. I do understand that the people who lost their families in the incident can't help blaming the scientists, but the judgment of Italy is too strict."
NBE00910,"I think this punishment was too strictly. If they kept doing this kind of thing, there wouldn't be any scientist or scholar who would try to alarm the earthquakes to us. As long as we live in the country where earthquake happens we should be prepared and the help of scientists would help us a lot."
NBE00864,"I think this punishment is not illegal because the scientists tried to estimated and alarmed. They have no crimes. when earthquake occurred, we must prepare, be careful and protect ourselves."
NBE00890,"I think that this judgment is amusing. Because, it is since a natural disaster is not what people can predict. Not a scientist but a public policy thinks that it is bad."
NBE00892,I think this punishment is wrong. We can not predict when perfectly natural phenomena such as earthquakes and typhoons will happen even if the technology developed . The scientist's punishment is illegal and it is not their responsibility. The punishment is too strict and should be reconsidered.
NBE00912,"I strongly agree with the part that ""I do understand that the people who lost their families in the incident can't help blaming the scientists, but the judgment of Italy is too strict. "" Judgment should consider victims' feelings, but scientists were not the criminals in this incident, I think. It can't be acceptable if trial thought they are the criminals so that they should be punished. Some may say that whether intentionally or not, they are criminals if they commit crimes. But I believe that people should also have had to consider that the scientist might make mistake. In that sense, I understand the victims' feeling, but it's foolish that only scientist should be blamed."
NBE00858,"I disagree to the sentencing of six Italian seismologists because I think that the judge may bother publication of scientist. If their announces was wrong, they would be sentenced. It give scientists a lot of risk. So, they may not refrain from their new discovery or research. I think it will have a bad influence on the freedom of science study, advance in our life and human happiness."
NBE00842,"It is unbelievable news. Where a natural disaster is concerned, we cannot estimate completely what will occur. Surely no one should speak about matters of great importance hastily and thoughtlessly. But scientists need to be able to keep researching and share what they know. If they lose the right, the scientific development will stop. So I think they should not have been punished for their right to research and our future."
NBE00882,"I feel it's very regrettable of the decision. It may give ""chilling effects"" to other scientists. People should realize that there is a limit even to science, and should judge all the research results by their own risk."
NBE00896,"After this judgment, many people point out freedom of expression has been damaged. Surely, this situation could be a problem of freedom of expression, which is the right that everyone should be able to say what they want, without fear of persecution. But I think pointing out focusing on only freedom of expression in this situation is out of focus. I think this situation is more of a problem of objectivity in science rather than freedom of expression. Because modern science is getting more complicated and unpredictable, the question if science is value-neutral or not has become a central point of controversy. I think science is value-neutral . Also, the point of this situation is that the Italian scientists got convicted because of communication, not science. If the scientists explained the results more minutely, people would have been able to understand the situation and prepare for the danger to the best of their ability. But the only thing the scientists said when they explained their results was that everything was 'safe'. This is the reason why people are angry. They did not explain the risks and possibilities in detail even though they knew there is no such thing as being 100 percent sure of results as a scientist. Resultingly, they did not perform their duties as scientists. Taking this incident as an example, society should change the method in which scientific decisions are communicated. As I mentioned above, science is value-neutral . Therefore, there should be lot of verification and discussion when applying scientific results which can make a huge practical influence on society. Also, civil society should verify if scientists announced the results truthfully and correctly without any political pressure. Professor Sheila Jasanoff from Harvard University who researched about scientists in law and politics said it is reasonable to investigate scientists' original results after they have been interpreted by people. For example, in 1989 scientists announced that BSE will never infect humans; therefore, many people believed their results and ate the infected beef. However, because many people died of BSE in 1990, people in England investigated the results that were announced in the same year. As a result, civil society and government of England revealed the scientists were wrong and republished the report in 2000."
NBE00846,"Generally people knows predictions on earthquake is impossible. Therefore, thr\ere must be few people trusted the prediction, be little damage for society. In addition, I think these scientists didn't have ill will. There is no reason to consider them as guilty."
NBE00848,"I agree to Michael Halpern's term, ""Scientists need to be able to share what they know - and admit what they do not know - without the fear of being held criminally responsible should their predictions not come true. "" Because, we can know various problems and solutions by the action of scientists."
NBE00847,"Michael Halpern said, ""Scientists need to be able to share what they know - and admit what they do not know - without the fear of being criminally responsible should their predictions not come true. "" I think this is true, and this is the ideal type of the scientists. They should be brave enough to tell their predictions to save people. However this is only an ideal and it's clear that not everybody can be like this. . . . . or maybe no one can be. Who would like to take a risk to say wrong things in public? To solve this problem, I recommend to make a environment that one can easily say their thoughts aloud."
NBE00888,"I strongly oppose to the sentence. It is natural that companies which neglect to confirm security of their products are punished for the accidents which caused by their product, but earthquake is natural disaster, so there's no one who responsible for it. Seismologists should be appreciated when they predicted earthquakes, but they should not be punished or blamed when they couldn't predict earthquakes."
NBE00886,I think these researchers very poor. It is difficult to predict natural phenomena. I think this decision is wrong.
NBE00876,I was shocked to hear the news. Science doesn't have absolute perfection. No one doesn't fail. Scientists shouldn't be criticized and we shouldn't depend on only science.
NBE00887,"Six scientists are innocent because nobody knows the power of nature. If officials make an error about measures of natural accident and some people killed in the accident, the officials may be guilty. In Japan, we had a hot discussion about this problem 3.11. I think a nuclear plant accident on 3.11 is a man-made disaster because the government could not show off a correct information."
NBE00841,"I think this punishment is surprising and I don't agree on it. It's impossible to predict when the earthquake occurs precisely. If that decision were correct, reporters of the weather forecast must quit there jobs."
NBE00884,"When I read the news, I was really surprised and shocked. It was sad to hear that lots of people were died 'cause of the earthquake, believing the words of the scientists that the place was free from the fear of the earthquake. But, think again. Can u believe the words of them 100 percent? Let us recall the casualty which happened in Japan on 11th Mar. 2011. Most of us believed that the nuclear plant was safe even if the earthquake happened. But actually. . . it was not. So, even the scientists or experts cannot completely expect what's gonna happen. I do not wanna say that we should not believe in them 'cause of such thing. I just feel we cannot say their words are not 100 percent correct. However, it is obvious that we are relying on science nowadays. If we restrict the freedom of the speech of the scientists, we cannot make use of them. So such thing should not be happened although they cannot predict all the thing."
NBE00877,"I could not believe this news when I first watched it on TV. This decision is as incoherence as ""fen shu keng ru""(this means ""burning books on the Chinese classics and burying Confucian scholars alive""), which the first emperor of China did. I didn't think such a crazy sentence was passed in the present, scientific time."
NBE00893,"I agree with the comment. Michael Halpern of the US -based Union of Concerned Scientists said that ""Scientists need to be able to share what they know - and admit what they do not know-without the fear of being held criminally responsible should their predictions not hold up"" in this article. I think too. Scientific freedom is the most important of this problem. I think scientists have a right to research freely."
NBE00873,"It is impossible to predict when and where earthquake occur perfectly. We know that after the big earthquake hit Tohoku and Kanto area in Japan in 3.11. Therefore, it is strange to press all responsibility against scientists who could not predict the earthquake completely."
NBE00852,"We have no means of predicting natural phenomena completely. If people were able to make an accurate of natural phenomena, we would not be sustained any damage caused by catastrophes. The Italian scientists should have admitted their underestimating and offered a comment on it modestly. After all, no matter how detailed they know about nature, there are no methods to predict disasters. If scientists are afraid of being censured about wrong predictions, the number of seismologists may be on the decline."
NBE00866,"I don't think the scientists don't have responsibility at all. It was the matter about our lives so I don't want them to say such thing without responsibility. They should say with ""may"" and explain their study hasn't finish, because we are ignorant enough to believe the saying of officials."
NBE00868,Almost the same to mine. And I do think we should protect ourselves on our own.
NBE00869,"I think the verdict is unreasonable because it is next to impossible to predict when an earthquake would take place. So we cannot blame scientists, but we can hope them to predict more correctly."
NBE00870,"I think we should think and act by ourselves. In this society, we cannot completely rely on someone or something."
NBE00902,"I guess predicting earthquake is very difficult because it is natural disaster. Even if the technology developed conveniently, i think we never know about natural disaster. it is ridiculous sentencing seismologists for underestimating the risk of the earthquake."
NBE00901,"I think no one can predict when the earthquake happens therefore, the scientist don't need to take the responsibility."
NBE00845,"I think that the scientists are completely innocence, too. A court in Italy should withdraw this decision."
NBE00844,"Freedom of science must be assured by governments. But this is thing that we must criticize. And the science of earthquake and other disaster may save a lot of lives. When I read this news, I remind the day of 311. I think tremendous numbers of people could save their lives. Government must restrict the freedom of science, This news is out of problem. And I hope such thing must not happen in the future."
NBE00872,"When I knew this news, I thought that I was very sorry for scientists. It is impossible to completely predict the natural phenomenon. Therefore I think that it is mean to file a suit against it even if a prediction came off. It is responsible to the people who completely believed the prediction. Such a thing never wants you to get up."
NBE00860,I agree with this comment because I think freedom for the scientists to say their research should be protected from another power. You could not deny that that sentence become the precedent for disturbing the freedom.
NBE00898,"I strongly agree with ID12063's comment. It is difficult to predict when the natural disaster will occur, even the scientists. I think I would believe what the scientists say because I do not have the perfect knowledge about the earthquake. I understand that sometimes the natural disaster do not occur even though they said it will occur. However I do not think that they should be put in jail."
NBE00863,"I can't believe the decision oh the court. scientists didn't commit a crime. Now, the technique of science is developing. But scientists are not god. So it is impossible that at any time, to predict when and where the earthquake happens, how much damages the earthquake causes. Because earthquakes are natural disaster and acts of God. So I think scientists were not responsible."
NBE00840,"This article is about predict of earthquake so our Japanese inevitably remember the 3.11 earthquake. Recently, some scientists presented the predict of the quake in Nankai Trough. If the real earthquake is more severe than the prediction of scientists , can we condemn them? The scientists have duties to investigate the tragedy and alarm the people. This responsible is hard and should be carefully taken by them. But they are obliged to make the predict excessive if they are criticized by the failure of underestimating. If so, they can't publish what they think. Academic progress can be done by many failures. In seismology, this theory is applied, too."
NBE00843,"I completely agree with her. I also think we should not stop their researching and development of scientific technique. And so their human rights should be protected. Certainly, sometimes even they make mistakes. But I think there is a lot of truth in what they say. They are superior to other people in a field of science. So we cannot but trust them when an emergency arise."
NBE00867,"This article made sad. And, I can't understand why the six Italian scientists and a government official were sentenced to six years in and ordered to pay more than nine million euros in damages. They arrive at an prediction by using daily observation and research. They have been trying hard. I think it is cruel that we let them all responsibility."
NBE00851,"I disagree with the judgment and feel pity for the seismologists. So that a natural disaster is called an ""act of God"", it is very hard for human to predict an earthquake correctly. We can make an effort not to suffer as slight damage from a disaster as possible. However, once it happened, there is nothing you can do for it. You cannot stop it. Therefore, I think that the seismologists do not have to be responsible for the earthquake."
NBE00839,"Many people say that these punishment is too hard and I think so, too. The failures scientists made is not good thing but it is unreasonable to put them into jails. The act which scientists have to do is trying to make more correct predict for the next earthquake."
NBE00891,This is very surprising news for me. It is impossible for any excellent scientists to predict an earthquake perfectly. Scientists don't have to be jailed because they have the right to speak freely and independently.
NBE00907,"Being able to predict an earthquake should only be a reference so I find it harsh that the semiologist were blamed for not predicting an earthquake correctly. As it says in the article, this will lead to restricting scientists from expressing freely."
NBE00883,"As I commented on the blog, Scientists should be given the freedom for developing the field."
NBE00913,"It was shocking that scientists became guilty because of filing prediction of earthquake. Human cannot control nature, and it is not their responsible. I think it is right to against to the verdict."
NBE00945,"I think Obama's re-election is meaningful for both US and Japan. First, for America, I believe that he is responsible for restoring finances because US has to face tax increase by expiration of big reduction of taxes and cutback of revenue early in the new year if any new policy don't carried out. It means American economy falls into serious depression and it influences for many countries all over the world. Next, he have showed friendship to Japan. Japanese government should take advantage of it to solve the territorial dispute with China and South Korea."
NBE00924,"I guessed Obama would be elected again, and actually it came to realized. It was allegedly said that Obama's triumph was monumental achievement because none had won re-election under high employment rate of above 8% since 1940. But given that there is increasingly population of Latinos who endorse Democrat, it isn't so surprising things. According to this article, 71% of Latinos voted Obama and 50000 Latinos turn 18 and are entitled to vote every month. The figure of 71% indicates that the large number of Latinos advocated him. His social welfare program 'Obama Care' probably attracted them, many of who are in low or middle income group. Also, his tolerant attitude toward illegal immigrants would be benefit for them, many of who are too immigrants or descendants of them. So, it might be natural that Obama won the re-election under such circumstances. Besides, the figures also indicate that Latinos is getting no longer minority in US and Obama is popular among them. The population of Latino voters is on the great increase and it follows that Obama may get more support of Latinos if he can keep his words. His victory might be good for US, but it would be bad for Japan. Usually, Democrats harshly require Japan to share the more costs of the US military base in Japan. Also, US-Japan relationship became weak during his first term. I hope he will put emphasis on the relationship and make every effort to strengthen it. ."
NBE00953,"The presidential election in America is one of the most important events. 4 years later, Mr. Obama won this election very easily, but this time, the election became harder than last time. During the campaign of election, the huge hurricane came to NY and the candidates stopped continuing campaign. I think Mr. Obama's correspondence of hurricane led winning of election. However, during 4 years which Mr. Obama was inaugurated as President, he didn't do good policies. I hope Mr. Obama will govern the huge country and the world rather than before."
NBE00955,"After hard competition, Mr. Obama eventually won the presidential election again. America gives various effects to Japan. Japan needs America's cooperation in some problems of Asia. So this election is important for Japan, too. What he will do in second term can influence on all over the world. I hope he won't break the goals of his second term which he set out, or he might be not able to won the next election."
NBE00937,"I was glad to hear this news. Mr. Obama is supporting TPP, of course, it has the risk to press Japanese agriculture and so on. But it is the most important to fight on the favorite field for Japan, and firstly, we should revive Japanese economy earlier than protect agriculture. I believe his victory will become Japanese victory. . ."
NBE00925,"I welcome Obama's reelection. I was surprised at the fact that Obama is only fourth Democrat to reelect. The American political climate is, I think, considerably different from Japanese. In short, they have much higher interest in politics than Japanese have. That offers the number of $932,013,388, which is the money supporters spent on Obama's campaign, or of $1, 028, 213, 064, which is on Romney's. Public notice of the Election of the House of Representatives in Japan will be provided soon. I will see how exciting it will be, and who will win it."
NBE00921,l think Obama's re-election is good news for USA. Mr. Obama has power of improving economy of USA and many problems. I expect him.
NBE00951,"I think it is hard four years for Barack Obama. Obama won and made the boom of ""Yes, we can. "" in the previous election. But, he does not have such power now. I think this is good news for Japan. I think Obama does not disregard Japan. But, there is a problem in Japan because Japanese prime minister often change. So, if Obama make a point of relation between Japan and US , Japanese government will not arrange a reception. I think this is good news for US too. I heard that Obama's measures against hurricane Sandy was good. I think it is important because measures against hurricane is a matter of life and death. So, I think this is good news for Japan and US ."
NBE00933,"For the time being I will praise Obama's re-election. Romney. had made many gaffes. Even if he had great results, he should be more careful for his remark. Prime minister has great influence on the people even when he says one word. Prime minister also has great responsibility for the people. In that point, Obama is better than Romney.. And also I think that we should evaluate his challenge of gay marriage and the policy of immigrant in the election term. Conceding gay marriage was different in the US this is because Christian doesn't admit gay marriage in terms of religion. But Obama decide to give gays the right to marry. It is meaningful for gays that are discriminated. This will be one step that does away with the discrimination. Furthermore, I think that the new policy of immigrate has the meaning. Fundamentally, the US has many races. It is said ""melting pot of races"". Nowadays, the number of Hispanic people is increasing rapidly. Most of them are illegal immigrants. Even though they are illegal immigrants in current system, Obama decide to accept immigrants under some conditions. He could show the tolerance of immigrant to the world. However, there are some doubts for Obama. For example, Obama didn't produce good result in four years. At present, US economy was bad. We cannot see the sign of getting over the recession. Can he really change the situation? Secondly, Obama won the election for the number of electoral colleges. But he lost the number of votes. In other words, he was not supported by ordinary people. It is problematic. Direct election of Prime Minister didn't work out. Under the circumstance, the opinion of the people may be reflected to the policy or bill. For these reasons, Obama must make effort to be trusted by the people."
NBE00980,i think mr. Obama's re-election is meaningful to Japanese economy and the problems with North Korea and China. president Obama wants Japan to join TPP and i know this will let down Japanese agriculture but i believes that it will makes Japanese industries better. also mr. Obama thinks that world needs to be safe and peace so he might do something when north and China became crazy.
NBE00971,"I was surprised four years ago, when Obama become first Black president in United States. Now, I was surprised once again. Through his four year career as president, there were many incident happen in United States. That include confront between Iraq. I think especially withdraw US military from Iraq and execute Osama Bin Laden works great for Obama's re-election. Also, he mention that he support gay marriage. It must be such a great news for people who are gay/lesbian who were discriminated. I think that earns his votes too. I hope Obama will do more great work in his second term of his presidency."
NBE00979,"I am quite happy for Barack Obama and the citizens of the United States as his odyssey continues to its full measure. I was first surprised when he acquired the position of the US president because I did not imagine American people would accept a 'black' as their leader(I do not mean to discriminate). However, all his work he has done throughout 4 years, I personally like him as I can see the real honesty in him and his statements. I also respect him as a great speaker compared to other presidents from all over the world."
NBE00977,"I like Barack Obama and know how much effort he made for the citizens because I have lived in the United States and learned many measures he tried. Unfortunately, the rate of unemployment has not changed a little, but I think he deserves to be the most respectable president in the world. Also, it is important for Japan. We are in dangerous situation about the islands among China, and Korea. Maybe he cares about Japan and saves us."
NBE00982,"One of the policies of Barack Obama about tax resulted in his re-election, I think. In US, the gap between the rich and the poor is quite big, and it would have become much harder for so-called low income earners to live if a policy that advocate raising tax had been adopted. Obama promised not to do that instead he would raise tax only for wealthy people. The policy gathered voter support. I hope the policy promotes wealth redistribution and work well."
NBE00963,"I think that this reelection is good for the United States. Obama will lead the United States with strong leadership. However, for Japan, it is not necessarily good. Pains will be taken over a foreign policy from now on."
NBE00969,"I'm really worried about Obama becoming a president again. Especially the relation between Japan. Generally, the Democratic Party is not pro-Japanese. I think it will be difficult for Japan to desire the growth of economy, diplomacy and so on."
NBE00927,"I'm very impressed that Obama won re-election; no one had done it since 1940. Furthermore, he got more than 50% votes. However, I realize Obama is not gaining a backing from Whites while Blacks support him as 93% elect rate. Now, in America, people who want medical care have to spend expensive cost or have to be insured. (besides, insuring programs isn't cheap at all to the middle, the lower classes. )However, Obama is planning to promote the public good by magnifying medical insurance more friendly to welfare. I expect his active part until he ends his duty."
NBE00954,"According to this article, Obama's re-election is evaluated in that he is only the fourth Democrat since 1900 to win two full terms in the White House. In this regard, I think, now we should observe it from another point. That is present leaders need much more time than ever to accomplish his policy enough. For now, in the far more fluid and complex world, only by short-term strategies, leaders can't make a difference. They have to do well with so many countries and deal with highly developed economy in order to be supported by people in his country. To do so, they inevitably need a long period of time. So I think that even if Obama couldn't do well in the last 4 years, another 4 years will help him bring something good for both US and the world."
NBE00975,"From point of view of Pro Japanese, I think it didn't matter which candidate was elected. Both candidates put stress on diplomacy toward China. The Japanese key is whether Japan can make a good use of this or not."
NBE00915,"l welcome Obama's re-election. It must be a good for America's future. His policy hit the heart of not only the poor but relatively rich people. For Japan, we don't lack him. His power of improving economy is respectful, I think."
NBE00926,"I don't understand Obama's policy. Honestly, I don't know that it affect to me, but I seem to affect to Japan. Japan get along with America in the future. Firstly, Japan should do it to settle the problem between Japan and China."
NBE00917,"I think Obama is one of the greatest president in the postwar period. He can manage this global situation. In Japan, new prime minister Abe was selected. I feel ease because Abe is the person who should be leader of Japan. He have defined vision of national defense. Japan has serious territory with China and South Korea. Japan must go in with US But the democratic party is unwilling to manage this problem. I expect his ability."
NBE00974,"Actually, I can not say which is better. However, Mr. Obama rendered some services to military affairs. I think that he has an ability to manage his country. And, at the presidential election, he promised that the government makes employment opportunities at the manufacturing industry. To be concrete, a million people will get the jobs. I expect that he fulfill a campaign promise immediately."
NBE00916,"I think that Obama is suitable for US President. He stressed importance of resolving the challenges that the world have, such as violent extremism, insurgency and spread of nuclear weapons. Whereas, Romney emphasized ""Peace through Strength"". I think Romney was too idealistic. US can't lead the world without solving the current problems. Though it is uncertain whether Obama succeeds or not, I believe he is a good president."
NBE00968,"Barack Obama, the 44th and current President of the United States was re-elected in November 2012. Due to the conservative political environment of America which has harassed a lot of ordinary and ill-informed people who make up most of the population, President Obama won the election in 2008. Keeping the social atmosphere which helped him to win the election by a landslide in mind, he had to continue progress towards leading America towards a more prosperous and harmonious future. This more moderate view which aimed towards the betterment of the American society greatly contributed towards his victory. As a politician in a democratic country where the politicians work for the good of the people, he had to embody this message that allowed him to win the election. Also, in regards to the international aspect of the United States of America, he had to consider what policies and practices of America could impact other countries. Furthermore, upon making these policies he had to carefully put them into practice so as to not disturb the international community. In the 4 years of his first term, he made a better welfare state while simultaneously enacting better policies for the international society. For example, on the domestic front, Federal welfare spending has grown by 32 percent over the past four years, accelerated by President Obama's stimulus spending and has also swelled by a growing number of Americans whose recession-depleted income has now qualified them for public assistance. Also, he ended US military involvement in the Iraq War. These kinds of actions can be praised by the public. But if we think about the message that he promoted during his campaign, we will notice that he has diverged a little from it. For example, He has worsened the war between Palestine and Israel with some careless policies, which have been characteristically repeated throughout the history of American diplomacy. He said ""There's no country on Earth that would tolerate missiles raining down on its citizens from outside its borders, "" and when he made this perfectly sensible statement he was not thinking of the Palestinians in Gaza, helpless victims of Israeli bombs and missiles or in some cases bombs and missiles that were dropped or fired from F-16 fighters or Apache helicopters manufactured in the US. He never changed his political attitude or policies towards the Palestinian civilization, despite being criticized by the international community. This does not seem like the practice of the American President who won the election under the banner of peace and betterment of society. For the next 5 years, civil society, which is concerned about the prospects of the future, should urge him to choose better policies in order to create and maintain a peaceful and just world society."
NBE00920,I think Mr. Obama's re-election is good and important for not only USA but also Japan and many countries. I expect him for economical and political problems.
NBE00929,"I think Obama's re-election have good influence especially Japan. Actually, When Obama erected as American president last time, I was surprised. And this time, too. I would like Obama be erected, but Romney had strong power especially on white, so I was glad to hear this news Obama's re-election. The reason is that Obama feel more and more friendship with Japan, so I think it is meaningful for us. Japan would be able to make a solid background on the relationship in Asia. Japan which don't have army needs American power, I think."
NBE00923,"I thought there was an unexpectedly large margin in the results of the vote. Obama probably won back his popularity by dealing with the approaching storm appropriately. The treatment reminds me of the great earthquake in East Japan, which Mr. Kan, the Prime Minister at the time couldn't cope with. And also Obama's attitude toward diplomacy might be supported by many people. I guess his mind was occupied with leaving achievements for the re-election. I want him to concentrate his energy on leaving achievements that remain in history."
NBE00965,"I think that the presidential election was a tough situation, Obama's approval rating is lowered. However, he was able to win the election because responded to severe hurricane damage immediately. I think it is an indication that expects to enhance the social welfare of the people to America's first black president in the unequal society progresses."
NBE00949,Congratulations! I'm glad to hear the news. America is the country that connects closely with Japan. It will be easier to conduct foreign relations if the same person becomes the president. I wish Japan could be the same.
NBE00928,"I'm happy to Obama was reelected US president. I support Obama. I believe this thing give Japan good effect. Sometimes, He is criticized for the mass media. They said Obama's policy aren't practical. But, I want to hold out him. I feel Obama is concerned about American people's happiness seriously."
NBE00959,I was shocked for reading this article. I can realize the greatness of Obama. I think his policy is so novelty. His policy brings much happiness for many people. I believe it.
NBE00956,"This re-election may reflects the hope of American people to him. They dissatisfied with his economic measures now, so I expect him to change that in the future."
NBE00966,Obama's re-election is the good news. I think being elected again shows peoples' confidence or expectations. And I hope this re-election bring some good changes to Japan.
NBE00961,I don't know that it is good news for Japan. America must decrease amount of money to military. The nation's finances are bankrupt because of the war.
NBE00960,Obama probably won back his popularity by dealing with the approaching storm appropriately. This opinion is good. And Obama's attitude toward diplomacy is appropriate.
NBE00935,This news is good for the world because he mention about economy especially reducing unemployment. It will be good for our economy. He couldn't do that this 4 Years but I believe he can du it. I want Japanese government to cooperate the U. S. and make a good relationship for Japan.
NBE00944,"When Obama was elected as American president 4 years ago, American people was so delighted and hoped that he would change the country. And, certainly, Obama solved some problem in and out of America. However, the situation is different from first election. The situation will be more difficult than then. It is worth seeing how Obama will change the world again."
NBE00950,I'm interested in politics but I don't know much about it. I just hope Japan and U. S will cooperate each other more and contribute to peace of the world.
NBE00936,"I'm glad and expect Mr. Obama's re-election. Against Japan, many Japanese are glad of his re-election I think. But in America, we know other candidate get popularity, I don't know what his election brings to America, but it's meaning America don't think Japan is important? I'm sad to know that."
NBE00939,I was glad to hear the news. I don't have so much knowledge about American politic or economy but he is the first black president of America so I think the late Mr. King would be glad too. I hope Obama's going well and leading the world to peace and welfare.
NBE00958,"Frankly speaking, I do not have Mr Obama's good impression. Because Japan is having the TPP problem which Obama brought about. I disagree with TPP participation. It is true that TPP participation will make Japan cause the competitions among Japanese companies and get cheap goods but it may make Japanese people of agricultural and medical fields ruin. Obama is clinging obstinately to Japanese TPP participation negotiation. When he was fighting in USA president election, I was deeply impressed by his having insisted TPP problems in order to collect more votes."
NBE00973,"this election is big news for all over the world. i hope Mr, Obama do good job and also Japan and America have a better international relations."
NBE00976,"I like Obama's way of speaking and was happy to hear this news. He speaks very powerfully and I have many things to learn from him. I don't know well about America's politics but since America is the strongest country in the world, he makes a good affect around the world."
NBE00972,"I am happy to hear this news because, I think Obama is better than Romney."
NBE00930,"I thought that Obama would re-elect again and he became 44th president in America. Japan and America have same category problem; it's an economy crisis. He will do his best to solve this huge problem. This is one of the main reasons that our politics have been confused and unsuccessful. I believe politics depend on economy, economy also depends on politics, so they are inseparable. We, for example, were on the rapid economic growth in the post-WW II period and we did not have huge politic problem with LDP at that time. There are new leaders in Japan and America. I wish Obama and Abe would improve both countries economy."
NBE00918,"It is good news for Japan. Mr. Obama treat Japan in friendly. Japan has problem about military base in Futenma. During Obama's government continues, Japan should solve it."
NBE00946,"I think that both Obama and Romney had done their best, but as the article says, Obama had succeeded in gaining votes from black, latinos, young ages and so on. But still, it is also true that the president have many difficulties that he has to confront with. As the article says, action on the deficit will require a ""grand bargain"" with Congress and that means the Republican party, which retained control of the House of Representatives, though Democrats remain in charge in the Senate. The risk for Obama is that, for all his renewed talk of bipartisan co-operation, he might be thwarted by all too familiar gridlock. Anyway, we Japanese also have to keep an eye on how the US will sail their ship because its decision of the route will affect our country and the stream of the world."
NBE00941,"I was really glad that President Obama was reelected in election. The Japanese Prime Ministers are changed in sequence, but may not determine it. Therefore I wants President Obama to govern it during a long period without being changed in sequence. I pray to the election four years later for President Obama being reelected."
NBE00942,"Japan does not have good China and Korea and relations now. However, this is because I think that he protects Japan from China and Korea by all means because Obama took office as the President in the United States. In other words the influence that is good for Japan is brought because Obama takes office as the President."
NBE00943,"This person worries about Obama taking office as the President very much. In addition she worries about relations with Japan, but I think that it does not need worry at all. Therefore I am against the opinion of this person."
NBE00970,"I think that the re-election is meaningful for Japan and America. As everyone knows, he has a great power, so I think would make the economies of America as well as Japan better."
NBE00932,"I wanted Mr. Obama to win the election, so I felt relieved to hear Obama's win. It may be so difficult to achieve goal he has displayed, but to displaying goal itself is meaningful. Above all for changing something, it needs many times. He might not be able to meet views of citizens perfectly, but I think, American citizens have to leave him more time. It can say to Japanese politics. In Japan there are so many elections and so many changing our tops. This is one of the reasons that though there are so many problems left, politician couldn't the solutions. We have to study from another countries elections and politics."
NBE00931,"I don't agree with this comment because I think whether this result become good for Japan or bad is depend on us. In fact Mr. Obama shows us the attitude that makes good relationships between Japan. Most important thing is how Japanese government do, and most important problem is they couldn't have clear strategy."
NBE00967,"I thought that Obama should have been elected, and now I think it is better to come it true. Mainly, their support base. That of Obama is, poor people and minorities including non-white people, gays and so on. On the other hand, that of Romney. is wealthy people and, so to speak, majorities. I think if Romney. would be elected, discrimination of races and minorities and distinctions between the wealthy and the poor would increase, not only in US but also globally, needless to say in Japan. We should pay attention to the result of a narrow margin, but a primary factor that made Obama win is authorizing equal marriage for gay couples, I think."
NBE00934,"I think Obama's re-election is very meaningful not only for America but also for world. In my opinion, Obama seems to be the man having a strong sense of responsibility. And it is also meaningful that a black person was re-elected the president of America which leads world as a leader. In the world, there are still remain racial discriminations. So this election was very important."
NBE00938,"I think this reaction is good for the United States. I am always touched by his strongest speech. Honestly, I don't know about American politics very much. , but only I'm interested in problem of American military base at Okinawa. Before, Japanese woman is raped by American soldier. I want this kind of happening never to occur. I hope trust relation of American and Japan is more good than before."
NBE00919,"Mr. Obama's reelection is good for USA and also for Japan. Especially in economical fields. The yen will keep itself strong and and because of that Japan can buy foreign stuffs cheaper. For instance, it makes possible for us to buy expensive things, such as gasolines cheaper."
NBE00922,"I do not know that Obama's election is good for the USA and Japan But, I have a reason why the Obama's election is very good for the USA. It is that First Lady Michelle Obama is tackling issue of childhood obesity. I heard that the nearly one in three children in the USA is considered overweight now. It is very serious issue. American government will have to spend more and more budget in the health care system. The government has to solve it as early as possible. Then, Mrs. Obama is tackling it. Concretely, she trying to bring health food to underprivileged communities and change menus in school. I think that food make us very happy. So, I feel it very sad that food caused many people death. Therefore, I support her campaign and think that Obama's election is good for the USA."
NBE00952,"I strongly agreed with her comment because I also expected that Obama came back as the President of US at election. Also he brings a good influence to both America and Japan. He was the president when world economy became worse and worse. He knew what happened in the world now, and he is impatient for reviving US economy like before. He has good relationship among other countries. This will help Japan to solve territorial problems between Korean and China."
NBE00940,"It makes no difference who the American president is. USA focuses on China, and no longer treats Japan as an important country. But I think Obama is better than Romney, so I felt relief at the news that Obama's reelection."
NBE00914,"At first, I wondered whether Obama could win the election. this is because he was criticized by some American. They said ""He couldn't accomplish the policy that he made in the last election"". In this time of recession, it is hard for people to wait the long-term policy to come true. But now he won the election, it is turned out to be true that American expect his long-term projects. I'm interested in problem of the gun control. Can he reinforce the law?There are lots of opponents, for example, National Rifle Association."
NBE00964,This news is very nice for Japan and USA. I respect Obama's skill of making speech and he is excellent president. He will lead USA bright future.
NBE00978,Having Obama as president is positive for both Japan and America. I thought this as everyone trusts him and is willing him to continue with his work towards world peace.
NBE00957,"Yeah, I guess it is a good thing for there are lots of poor people in America and he is saying that he's gonna help them. But the important thing is that he need to deal with the fiscal cliff first of all."
NBE00983,"Obama did a great effort and got the win on this election. What I noticed at this election was, changing of supporters. Obama collected votes from 93% of African American, 71% of Latinos, and 55% of women. Today, the US is not only for white men. Other races, young ages and also women organize this society. So, the leader of this country is also needed to change for people. I hope Obama would rustle more in his second term."
NBE00947,I want Obama to make the society more liberal too.
NBE00948,the reason why Japan is on bad terms with US depends on Japan. Japan's fuzzy reaction makes US irritated.
NBE00962,"He was re-elected , but the situation is different from that of first time he was elected. When he elected to president for the first time, people in USA have a lot of expectation to him, but this time, he was elected because his opponent laid too emphasis on rich people."
NBE00981,"I think having Obama as a president of America is good for America and Japan. And I think the way he talks has a lot of power to make people understand and convincing. Every time there is a election in US I always think it is interesting how American citizens become very active because it is very different from Japan. I was surprised when I when to america right before election, there were lots of things that has Romney. and Obamas print on them on sale every where. I think this difference of interests comes from the election system in America."
NBE01504,"After I read this article, I'm happy that he was elected. Of course I can't agree with all of his ideas, but I want him to hang on!"
NBE06924,"When I heard his re-election, I'm very good feelings. It is true that his deeds are not always good. However I think he is one of the best presidents."
NBE01014,"I think it's natural for Sony and their bond company to be downgraded in its market because their main products don't distinguish for their techniques. Instead of them, other company like Samsung and apple succeeded in many frontier fields such as smart phones or tablet PC. Japanese company should make an effort to develop new products that are attractive to the people all over the world and approach to their customers."
NBE00995,"Japanese technical industries are now on the verge of extinction. Once they had big power and their products were popular all over the world. But Those sectors has changed and developed themselves so rapidly that just small strategic mistakes may lead them to death. In addition, "" the third power"" such as China, Taiwan and South Korea, appeared large and now is playing an important part of it. In order for Japanese companies to stay longer in the fields, or for their resurrection, they need to find what only Japan can make it."
NBE00994,"I guess the reason of Sony's ruin lies in sticking to its old policy. In a period of high economic growth, when there were many young workers and people didn't have much electrical appliance, Sony's TVs and cameras were selling well in Japan. On the other hand, now people are already surrounded by high efficient and durable electrical appliance, and the population of young people, who needs new appliance to start new life, is decreasing. It was natural that Sony couldn't keep its previous profits without creating new main goods. Information technology is developing day by day, and now smartphones are one of the most selling devices. While foreign competitive companies such as Apple and Samsung entered the market immediately, Sony got behind. It is true that a company have to take risks when entering new market. But Sony should have considered the risk of sticking to the same policy."
NBE01048,"To recover Japanese firms for example Sony, Panasonic and so on, I think that there are two improvement points. First, I need to internal reforms. These companies should encourage young employees. Second, these companies are defeated in technology to Samsung and Apple. So they need to new product development."
NBE01041,"I want Sony and Panasonic to overcome the situation because these are Japanese companies and they are required to maintain the Japanese economy. Furthermore, the situation causes the employment issue. Young people who want to get a job are not be able to work because of the issue. For that reason, I would like these companies to overcome the situation."
NBE01058,"Due to recent economic depression, not only Sony and Panasonic but also almost all companies are suffering from decline of revenue. There are actually some companies which can survive and even grow in this situation, but I guess all of such companies keep coming up with new idea and creating new products which can sell well. Sony and Panasonic have to make new products which can attract consumers enough to compete with Apple or Samsung."
NBE01039,"I hope Sony and Panasonic to recover . Although thinking from the real, it is difficult from now. This two companies should not only keep up with the fashion but also look forward . I desire that these company will contribute to Japanese economy."
NBE01004,"It is difficult for me how to success the business. But what I could know through reading this news is that to look beyond the trend is very important. Japanese company was not good at looking beyond the trend, so Sony failed. I want them to study from another country's company and get over the present condition."
NBE01019,"SONY was one of the biggest companies which represented Japan to the world. However, because of Apple, or Microsoft, SONY went into the red recently. Right now, Japanese require SONY to reborn as the big company to the world. I think that was strange. In this century, the Internet systems became common and Apple, or Microsoft which is good at SNS became bigger and bigger. In order to make a big company which can compete with other companies in the world, Japan has to make a new company which has strong face to the Internet. We don't have to rely on only SONY. I hope some Japanese companies will compete with Apple or Microsoft in the future with new Internet system."
NBE01022,"I hope SONY and Panasonic overcome this situation. These days, more and more people use abroad products, for example Apple, Microsoft. However It causes various problems. Economic problem is one of them. We should use Japanese products for Japan. Also SONY and Panasonic have very good products. We should be proud of them."
NBE00985,"It's a really difficult topic, but I do hope SONY recover its prestige. It's true that foreign products are relatively low, and more and more consumers like it these years. For example, Samsung and Apple is so popular in these 10 years. But we Japanese must buy our country's product more. Japan's technology has its own tradition and history, and has been sophisticated continuously. Of course I admit foreign country's products, too. so we must reconsider the importance of domestic industry and products and the balance."
NBE01008,"I think this problem is too difficult to solve. But I think Sony is wrong to chose the course of action. To understand the needs of users and reflect the voices of users to products is important. Recent computers are improving the faculty had by computers originally, but it's the boundary to do. So the computer should advance to the other way, not only to evolve to small size, reduce weight and hurry."
NBE00991,"the problem is difficult for me. i don't know how we should do. in any case, I hope Sony and Panasonic to recover."
NBE00988,"I was shocked when I read this news. Because Sony was one of biggest company in Japan, and I believed Sony was making a profit. Certainly, Apple and Samsung is popular. But, I think Sony have a trump card, that is games. I like Sony's games, and want to expansion the territory."
NBE01046,"I agree with ID12048's opinion. For an economic recovery, SONY and Panasonic should restore themselves. The government need to negotiate with foreign countries and international communities, like USA and EU for the conclusion of Economic Partnership Agreement(EPA) or Free Trade Agreement(FTA). In this respect, Korea is one step ahead of Japan. I think that is why Samsung is good condition now. I heard that 2, 950 employees of SHARP lost their jobs on 15 December. The Government, especially Mr. Abe must take some steps immediately."
NBE01042,"I think it's natural for SONY and other companies such as Panasonic to lose their power in the market. Once companies got too big, it's very hard for these companies to change their direction of management. Even if they knew not change one would lead their companies to lose their power. They have to maintain their customer as much as possible, so they can't enter to new market like other smaller companies do. I hope these companies to overcome the situation since these are companies that represent Japan's strength in the market."
NBE01051,"I think the Sony is going crazy. Actually, my father used to work for them, but he quit recently and, their work is getting worse and worse. In spite of that, they started to carry out mandatory retirement for managers at a certain age. I do not understand what they are trying, and believe what they need in fact is experience."
NBE01055,"as ID12055 and ID12063 said, it is true that Sony and Panasonic needs to come up with a new product to catch up to Apple and Samsung. but i think it is easy to affiliated with Apple or Samsung. because Japanese industries are still wandering after the depression that happened in 2008."
NBE01035,"I think it is very difficult problem. Today, many people uses smartphones or tablets, and Apple or Samsung are influential in this field. Actually, I use iPhone, and around me, many people use iPhone. But I want sony and panasonic overcome this situation. I think Japanese companies can show their reliance and make original goods."
NBE01043,"I think that sony still have a power to recover the situation. They have a technology to make a good product however they don't have a platform. So, they need a original platform which is different from other. It will lead to make more fans of sony."
NBE01044,This is difficult story for me. I think Sony and Panasonic are biggest company in Japan so I hope they would do better in business and recover their situation.
NBE01049,Sony is a top class company that supports Japans economy and they must overcome this situation for Japan to come revive. Sony have the quality and I wish them to be the top of the world.
NBE01057,"I think it is too late for Japanese company to catch up with companies abroad. Japan should have been aware of companies abroad especially Asian country, more early. It is obvious that Asian country's companies were thinking Japan as a rival which they should win for the first thing. They were all thinking of the way to win Japanese companies while we were only thinking of the new product with out any aim. Though it is too late, I think Japanese companies should ether cooperate with foreign country or find the way to take the market, which we used to own, away from Asian companies."
NBE01007,Not only Sony but also other Japanese companies don't have power to compete against oversee's company such as Apple. The reason losing competition is Japanese company has no products which attract many people. Japanese company should be strong to compete against other big companies.
NBE01032,"I think that this problem is very difficult. Now, many companies, such as an apple and Samsung, are going into Japan. It is difficult to overcome these companies. However, if it is Sony which has towed Japan until now also, I expect that it is OK."
NBE01018,"I think this change like Sony is a natural incident because in machine industry it is very quick to change new products. So, companies should make an effort. But, I think the government should support development of technology because if the government do not support, Japanese companies lose international competition. According to the news story, digital platforms is run by five big companies. Microsoft keeps winning in a side of OS. But, Facebook is a new tool. So, I think there is a chance to win digital platforms market. I think it is said the same in device market."
NBE01050,"We do not need to care about Sony, but hope for other good companies god high technology and knowledge about the internet."
NBE01020,"I also think that SONY missed the shift that has led the company to miss its shot at platform power. The reason for this might be that it has been contented with conventional regular customers consuming it's product now and future. So they has concentrated on closing them around, losing sight of the view to go next stage or digital platform. This is applicable to many other Japanese countries, such as Panasonic, SHARP, and so on. They should surely recognize that emerging nations are strong in the manufacturing industry and should take on the responsibility of acting as platform."
NBE00999,"I think downturn of Sony is caused by a lack of recognition about information technology trend. People use messengers such as LINE at the moment however, In Japan, people used to use mails but not LINE. Moreover, it was rare to see smartphone. In my perspective, this kind of life pattern made Japan company to think smartphone industry is not important to their business. It will be very hard to overcome this crisis since Apple, Samsung or even Nokia dominated smartphone industry. Therefore, I suggest to Japan electronic companies to concentrate their efforts to make applications and peripheral device."
NBE00993,"Owing to the price destruction, commodities made by Sony have been selling poorly, though Sony has made a lot of goods. Originally, it is important for companies to make creative commodities that are not compared with others, in order not to be seized the right to decide a price by mass marketers. I guess Sony doesn't be aware of it very much. Anyway, I can't bring myself to see the state that Sony follows a path of decline, because Sony is also one of the companies which Japan is proud of."
NBE00987,I love sony and use a lot of sony products. So I hope that sony get back their former position. Sony must change in order to catch up with this world situation. Japanese company is in the difficult situation because of appreciating yen and commotion of politics. So this problem is not only sony's problem but also problem which bother many Japanese global companys. Japan have tremendously problems now. And we Japanese must clear up.
NBE01047,"I agree with ID12063's idea. I think that Japanese company are cling to past achievements. As ID12063 says, Japanese companies such as Sony and Panasonic should innovate own products and company's system. I hope that Japanese company will be upgrade again."
NBE01059,"Maybe I agreed with her opinion until recently. But I came to think that Japanese companies shouldn't try to compete with other foreign companies. Since early times, Japan was good at making tiny and small things because Japanese are very dexterous. The technique is used from toy parts to semiconductors. On the other hand, Japanese are bad at making huge things. If you try to make a big company like Microsoft or Apple, it will need a lot of people, money and continue to make ""new"" things. At this point, I think Japanese are unfitted because we are good at improving goods but not good at making new goods. In other word, we have great techniques but we don't have great ideas. We have a lot of things that can overwhelm foreign people, so we shouldn't dare to win in the other fields."
NBE00997,"I thought Sony was the most biggest company in the world. But, recently, Sony has deteriorated management. Conversely, Samsung in South-Korea has been developing. Sony can't recover its original position. I want it to try hard more."
NBE01003,"This article lets me know why Japanese companies have been declining in these days. It is because they have been focusing the device market, but now it does not required, the most required stuff is a platform like a hotspot. I did not know that and it is pretty fresh to me. Although I knew that Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Apple have great power, I did not know why these companies have great power and I have never tried considering that reason before. However, the device market has changed into the platform market before I know. Japanese company should widely expand the business without fear of failure. They should not be afraid of failing, just keep on trying. We always have to be more creative. Japanese economy has reminded stagnant and has declined. We cannot forget the past achievements and prestige. We were the 2nd powerful country in the past and we are proud of it, but now we are not in the position followed by other countries; we are in the position of coming from back; we are the challenger. We have to create many things that anyone cannot think. Consolidating Sony, Panasonic, NEC, Fujitsu, and Toyota into one company is one of ways to improve Japanese economy and it is a way not to lose the American five titans. We should just keep on trying."
NBE01045,I think that Japanese companies can develop products which compete against other big companies. I expect that these companies keep hard works.
NBE01001,"I think Sony is one of the biggest makers in Japan and popular all over the world, so I was surprised with knowing this news story. In other words, I was disappointed. I believe that it is Sony that the company leads economy of Japan, so I would like to Sony have power to compete with other country. I think that Sony should change along the world trend for himself and Japan. If not, Japan would not catch up with the world. To survive, we have to have an effort on the best."
NBE01023,"It is said that 99.98% of all of the Corporation goes bankrupt in 30 years. Thinking about this thing, the exist of Sony is almost a miracle. I want to see the ""miracle"" in the future, so I hope them to survive."
NBE00986,"Sony failed to catch the taste of the times. And in addition to Sony, many Japanese companies are overwhelmed by the overseas companies. But I think they will be able to survive because quality of the Japanese product is superior to any other countries. Once Apple's iPod swept over the world, and Sony's WALKMAN didn't sell well. But Sony broke a deadlock by their technology. Now many companies work hard to please a user. But Japanese companies should return to origin. It is to regain ""Japanese quality"" in the one and only that they must do now."
NBE01038,"On April 10th 2012, Sony predicted that it would lose 520 billion yen ($6.5 billion) in the fiscal year that ends on March 31st 2013, the biggest loss in its 65-year history. Since IT is a fundamental part of the Japanese Industry, if Sony or Panasonic, the two largest IT companies in Japan, were to have an economic crisis then this situation would significantly impact the Japanese economy as a whole. Kazuo Hirai, the President and CEO of Sony Corporation, announced that the following three products: digital imaging, including cameras; gaming; and mobile phones are core to Sony. These three areas of investment are causing some major problems within the Sony budget. But I believe that these kinds of measures that aim to mitigate crises in a short period of time cannot prevent long term problems because IT industries are an area that need a lot of time to invent and market a technology. I suggest investing in basic sciences as a solution. IT industries are based on applied science and can only be progressed through the advancement of the pure or fundamental sciences. In many countries, both the Educational Policy as well as the National Policy places a lot of emphasis on the development of pure science. Consequently these countries often are the countries that have the potential to wield a lot of power within the International Community. Furthermore, this kind of condition is relatively advantageous to Japan because Japan has been increasing their power in pure science; this has been demonstrated in many papers and contests. Because of this, Japan can apply the fruits of its labor towards applied science and technology. Also, this kind of policy could be more effective because of the diligence of Japanese, which has been a great Social Capital for Japan. However, there are a lot of problems that need to be fixed in order for the Japanese industry to progress. The biggest problem that I want to point out is the ineffectiveness of the Japanese IT industry company working conditions. These companies make employees work as long as they can. That includes working extremely late into the night. Because of this, many talented engineers are hesitant towards working in Japan. This can also be applied to both Japanese companies and society. Furthermore, these kinds of working conditions are not beneficial for the creativity of the employees or the creative atmosphere of the company. The loss of creativity is especially hazardous for IT industry. Because of these reasons, the Japanese should increase their focus towards developing their scientific prowess as well as to strive to make a more accepting and creative working atmosphere. I believe that this will powerfully aid the growth of the Japanese"
NBE01034,"Japan has led the world with superior technology. However, now we can not win the world competition as long as there are no new technological innovations. Japanese companies should reconsider the strategy to detect early trends in the world as well as Sony. I want to approach the world more greedy."
NBE01056,"As ID12055 and ID12063 said, it is true that Sony and Panasonic needs to come up with a new product to catch up to Apple and Samsung. But I think it is easy to affiliated with Apple or Samsung, because Japanese industries are still wandering after the depression that happened in 2008."
NBE00989,"When I read this article, I was shocked because I knew that Japanese companies are downgraded and it's now in a fear of extinction but I never knew that it's because Japanese companies have been focusing the device market, but now it does not required, the most required stuff is a platform like a hotspot. This information was totally new to me. I felt like I understood about the economy more. I don't have the sense of economies so I can't say smart things about this, however the one thing that I want to say about this, is that Japanese companies need to be more active and positive. If they do nothing in fear of failure, nothing will never change. I expect them to succeed and play an active part in the world."
NBE01031,"Using smartphone and iDevices, I felt that customer's experience matter these days too, but this doesn't simply mean that Sony can't recover, I think. Sony's technological strength should be genuine, so what they have to do is catching the trend and creative idea. By the way, I think CM of Xperia aiming too high to understand."
NBE01015,"In the article it is said as below, ""The truth has turned out to be more powerful than that. Devices are merely servants, connected to the broadband networks that more than three-quarters of US homes have, or wirelessly connected to the home networks or coffee shop hotspots that have doubled in use since tablets came around. A platform world teaches us this truth: it's not the device that matters, it's not even the connected device that matters. It's the connected experience that matters"". What is said here maybe true to some extent but it doesn't hold true to this context, the falling of Sony. Yes, I can understand that the connected experiences is very important to achieve demand from the customers, and SNS and digital platforms such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft have succeeded in meeting with people's demands. However, the declining of Sony and other Japanese electronic device making companies are due to other factors. Firstly, it is due to globalization which has made the cost competition severe. As you know, as the globalization prevail our world, how cheap you produce the product and how well you sell them are very crucial for the survival. This will lead to fundamental problem that some Japanese companies are facing. That is, high yen rate made it difficult for Japanese companies' exporting their products. Because the rate of yen is so high and the cost of the Japanese products systematically get higher, people in other countries doesn't purchase them. In other words, the Japanese products are not meeting the demands of buyers. On the other hand, Samsung is cheaper than Japanese ones and well made than Chinese ones, which is meeting the demands of customers so that's why it is growing. So as you can see, these kind of economic factors take an important role on whether the company will prosper or fail."
NBE00990,"I hope two companies, Sony and Panasonic, overcome this situation. These companies have very big influence in Japan for economy, and so on. So these companies should be recovered immediately, and thereby Japanese economy will come out of big slump, I think"
NBE01026,"Sony was a presence that leads the world, Sony was a presence that leads the world. Since the Japanese economy would fall into a crisis situation by Sony bankruptcy, Sony should make a great solution to overcome this situation as soon as possible."
NBE01016,"I hope SONY and Panasonic overcome this situation. The share at Japan increases foreign company, Apple and Microsoft. The situation also occurs in smartphone market. iPhone gets popularity. So domestic maker's share has decreased. In order to overcome this situation, they have to create new technology and i believe they can do."
NBE01000,"Sony slipped back, this matter is so disappointing. But, I think it is natural. At once time, Japanese technology was highly regarded. But, recently, South Korea's development is truly remarkable. And, American corporation, for example Apple. inc's products are fascinating the world. Japan have to win South Korea and America for development. It is so difficult. I think, Japanese corporations doesn't have the ability to make new idea."
NBE01036,"I want Sony, Panasonic and Sharp to over come this hard situation. They are ones of the biggest company in Japan, and they influence economies not only in Japan but also all over the world. Therefore, I think that they have key of escaping from this severe business slowdown in Japan. These three overcoming will make good times in Japan and the world."
NBE01005,"I strongly believe that Sony should consider the customer and market. now, SAMSUNG is rising rapidly. SAMSUNG's products is certainly more cheaper than Sony. So Sony depended on its bland. But what is important is that company make the product which customer want to buy. Not only function but also design is necessary. Furthermore, Sony is forestalled when company make new product or technology. So this company slipped back. Of course, when we hear this is sony product, we feel that this product is safe and functionable. However, now is the time when there is a condition that products is safe, as I said, when customer compare products, they see the design. so Sony too depend on its bland."
NBE01025,"I think that Japanese company is not thriving now. Instead of famous Japanese company such as sony and panasonic are not flourishing , in the world foreign big company such as apple and samsung are rapidly developing. I am using iPhone 5 made in apple, i am not using Japanese cell phone. In the world, Japanese phones are disappearing. I think that it is very important for Japanese company to deplore the new fields."
NBE01028,I don't think that the ways can't revive the Japanese companies. Because the companies in Japan has already done like that.
NBE01010,"First I became sad at this news because I like this maker Sony and I'm using some devices it made. But at the same time, I felt the passage of time . There is nothing doesn't change. So we should make everyday life new in order to shine for a long time."
NBE01053,"Some students have said that they hope that Sony and Panasonic overcome the current situation and catch up to the company, called 'digital platforms' in the article. However, I think that it is unfortunately too late to achieve this any more. I insist this because I do not think that many Japanese people have necessarily need of the electronic products made by these companies. For example, an iPhone from Apple is now the best seller of smartphones in Japan even though we have a large number of Japanese-made mobile phones. Also, I remember that we used to utilize Japanese search engines such as 'Yahoo Japan!, ' but currently it is common for everyone to use Google for any information research. Considering these, it is not impossible, but must be very difficult for Sony and Panasonic to survive the 'technology company competition. '"
NBE01054,"I agree with her because she insists that it is too late for Sony and Panasonic to overcome the situation and catch up to other companies. She also has got a good point in her comment where she says that Japanese companies should cooperate with foreign countries. I think that it is an only strategy Sony and Panasonic can take in order to survive the technology competition. Like she said, it is difficult for them to win any more, but I believe that they still have a chance not to 'lose. '"
NBE01017,"Related to this news, I've also heard the news that competitive positions of Japanese electronics manufacturers such as Sony, Toshiba and Panasonic in the world are weakening year by year by contrast with Korean manufacturers such as Samsung and LG. What made the difference of them? One reason is the difference of the governments' protection. Korean government protected some growing companies like Samsung by reducing a corporation tax. I think Japanese government should do so as soon as possible. I know it's the only solution of this problem, of course. However, it is certain that this way is the useful one. Anyway, I want Japanese manufacturers to revive again."
NBE01002,"I agree with this idea strongly. I also think that Japan has faced serious economy crisis, because not only Sony but also other big device makers would not improve like few decades ago. Besides, I believe strongly that economy of one country relates to its politics, in other words Japanese politics have been confused as there are 7th Prime Ministers in 6 years, because Japanese company have not made a big success even in Japan. They should challenge a lot of new project; not only making device but also creating hotspot like developing companies. Then, Japan economy will get better and that will make our politics more creative and more wonderful."
NBE00996,This news is very important for our future. You should not avert your eyes to such a thing. I have to consider this problem seriously.
NBE00998,"After I comment to that news, I also thought that Japanese companies have to merge to cope with global-scaled companies. Currently, in Japan, there are so many electronics companies such as Panasonic, Sharp, Sony, Toshiba and so on. In my thought, this cause distribution of profits. In Korea, people would usually say that Samsung and LG when they asked which companies are renowned as focusing in electronics. Thus, Japan have to try to find a solution to a problem by merging some companies and making new global-scaled company which can cope with other foreign gigantic enterprises."
NBE01012,"Though Sony is Japanese company, it is behind the world company. In contrast, I am regretted very much. My family uses a thing of Sony including TV and the game console. I think that regain power if Sony invents some thing. I support Sony!!!"
NBE01021,I disagree with 12058's comment. Surely people who have many experience is important. However I think Sony need change and get along with time. So they should take new young power.
NBE01013,"Japanese strong yen, which is restoring by degree, affected Japanese export and Japanese manufactured goods are not sold. And Japan has lost its economical power which is said to be the most significant around the world. In accord with it, Japanese big companies, for example, SONY, TOSHIBA, PANASONIC, have become weaker and weaker. However, I don't think that strong yen is only blame on the situation where their goods have lost popular around the world. There are many tasks they have to solve. First, Korean companies, for example, Samsung, can make goods which have the same quality as ones made in Japan for cheaper place. Second, they can't make innovative products. Apple has made many innovative products and they were successful. If they can't make their products innovative as they were in these days, they can't regain their power."
NBE00984,"Today, many products made in other countries are in our Japanese lifestyle. You can see many people who use cellphone or laptops which are made by Apple or Samsung in this university . And I also use Apple's cellphone, too. There was a ""belief"" which goods made in Japan are safer than product made in Korea, China and so on. Unfortunately for Japanese companies, this thought may have gone away. This ""made in Japan"" belief has supported Japanese Company so much. Of course, Sony was helped by this, too. Now, Samsung or other companies now have technique which can make products by low costs . And these products are as good as Sony's goods. What should Sony do to thrive?In Japan, it is not easy to cut down much of personnel cost. I think Sony should try to continue to make products more fascinating for the customers."
NBE01040,"I disagree with this comment. I think there are some other reason why Sony slipped back, so I would like Sony to research why this thing happened and recover from the situation as soon as possible to maintain the economy of Japan."
NBE01037,"First, I don't think using foreign product is bad. Japan is capitalistic country and basic rule of capitalism is people have rights to choose good product. By that kind of rule, companies compete and people became have more freedom of choosing. If people only choose the product which produced by their country, It will be bad for consumer and also companies in a long term. Second, he commented 'Also SONY and Panasonic have very good products. We should be proud of them. ' but even though I live in Japan, I am not Japanese and I also do not think Sony and Panasonic have very good products. The products which made by SONY and Panasonic are hard to use outside of Japan and have a low quality compare with apple and Samsung. Accordingly, I do not find any logic with this sentence. This is the reason why I strongly disagree with this comment."
NBE01006,"I think it is the very difficult problem that Sony and Panasonic can overcome this situation and recover because of the entry of foreign enterprises into the domestic market like Samsung and Apple. Regarding to cellphone and personal computer, it is clearly that Samsung and Apple recently distinguish themselves. But I have heard that Japanese technology is very great more than any other countries. So I believe Sony and Panasonic to recover and lead the world."
NBE01009,"It is important problem for both Sony and Panasonic. Recently, Apple has grown rapidly. And, SNS, such a Facebook and twitter and so on, is new tool for people. I hope that both company recover management again."
NBE00992,"When I went to England last summer, I made many friends from foreign countries there. And, I saw, most of them have iPhone or SAMSUNG's smart phone, but a person who has SONY's one is only Japanese. Moreover, there are many advertisements of SAMSUNG on the street and I watched its CMs. But, I hardly have seen SONY and Panasonic ones. I think that the companies should try to expand in the overseas market."
NBE01011,"I think it is natural for SONY to be downgraded. I heard Koichiro Tsujino's lecture 2 month ago. He once worked at SONY, but he thought he should leave there. That's because SONY has been insisted on the past glory. It is hard to accept a new wave, but SONY should do and make a new wave. I want SONY to recover, and SONY should recover."
NBE01033,"This news is very bad for Japan. In my opinion, Japan's company has many advancing technology. Therefore, I believe Sony and Panasonic will restore by new and astonishing technology."
NBE01052,I am disappointed to hear that sony has been downgraded by the rating agencies. I have been a huge fan of sony's product since I was young so I hope they get their place back.
NBE01024,"I guess what the author says is absolutely correct, but personally, I want Japanese company, such as sony to be the leading company of the industry. They have highly prized technique, so what they must think is how to convey it to the customer I guess."
NBE01060,"Sony It is shocking news for Japan that Sony, one of the biggest company represent Japan, is falling back. The thing you can learn from sony is not to satisfy with the past glory. Technology is evolving every day. Improving is needed even Sony which was famous in everywhere just 10 years ago."
NBE01030,"ID12014's comment on the article of Sony. A lot of people in Japan use smartphone or LINE as other leading country do, so that is not the cause of Sony's plunge."
NBE01029,"I am sad to read this news. Sony had been leader of this sector. These day, Samsung overcome Sony as the article says. Sony cannot join in the companies which make platforms. . . Sony has lost his way."
NBE01027,I think sad too.
NBE02472,I think so for your thought. SONY should fight the world in technology. I believe in Japanese technology is best in the world and Japanese company would make an effort to will be best company. Go for it SONY and Japanese company!
NBE02452,"In my opinion, biggest difference between Sony and the five companies in the article is the ""contents"" It is absolutely true that Sony's products are high quality and durable. And, needless to say, quality and durability of products is very important. However, contents of devices is also pretty important to customers. For example, Apple makes IT products: iPods, iPhone, iPad. And also Apple makes applications(app) for that and sells apps other companies develop. This is what customers are attracted to. For this reason, Sony should make more efforts to develop contents to catch up leading companies in the IT field."
NBE06925,"Today, Japanese electrical companies are faced with many dangerous problems. First, South-Korea and China is increasing their share of electrical productions. And today, Japan can't go ahead. Second, Japan don't have a large amount of labor power. This is because Japan is decreasing birth rate and aging population, so to resolve many problems, Japan has to solve decreasing birth rate and aging population."
NBE05995,"When I saw this news on TV, I was glad. I have pride as Japanese. I have known existence of UNESCO heritage status and I had convinced that Japanese traditional cuisine (Washoku) had be going to get UNESCO heritage status. Because I have experience I have been to some other country and have eaten some food each country. All of them are delicious for me. Sense in other country it is first experience to eat food. But I thought maybe get try of eating that if I stay there and eat food every day. Then I was sure rustic flavor of Japan is great. I do not tried of eating even if eat every day. Then I had convinced that Japanese traditional cuisine had be going to get UNESCO heritage status."
NBE01279,"Actually Japanese tech companies cannot compete on American companies(Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft), but these must have learned from what mistakes Japanese companies has made. Japanese companies should learn how the American companies do and introduce their way if necessary. There's no time to make a kind of new way or system. I hope they overcome themselves and come back to the true battlefield."
NBE01829,"Sony had reigned as the top. However, I think that growth of Sony has stagnated like this report in me. Because, while Samsung, LG, etc. are lengthening the share of television, neither Sony nor Panasonic is lengthening the share. Sony has to throw away an old idea and has to take in a new idea. Then, Sony will reign as the top once again."
NBE02788,"SONY is a Japan's proud company. The achievements SONY has made are very great. In order that SONY restores, new way which is different from any other company in the world is necessary. I think SONY's technology isn't be inferior to foreign companies' even now. I love walkman better than iPod because the quality of the product is higher. I expect SONY will be the top company in the world again."
NBE02867,"Of course Sony used to thrive because it was the device that matters, it was the connected device that matters at that time. But since it has not kept up with the time, Sony has declined. I think Sony will be one of top tech companies again if it makes an effort to catch up with the time. For example, thinking about WHAT people need, WHAT society need, HOW the time goes around, and so on. . . . By thinking these idea, Sony can create what we need most and Sony itself will be a top tech company."
NBE02868,"I think Japanese company's device like Sony, Panasonic and so on have the highest technology. But other country's company device also have enough technology to use comfortably. So now, consumers need is not on technology but design. There is trend people need devices with good design. Other country's company like Apple is typical example of good design device. Consumers need is changing. Japanese companies are late for this trend. They have to change direction of producing devices."
NBE06690,"I can't agree all of the opinion written in this article. SONY has many business segments, and each of them has huge brand power and assets even now. For example, ANIPLEX which is affiliated company of sony is one of the biggest anime production in Japan. One more, Zepp Entertainment which is also affiliated company of sony is one and only one company that own and management many big concert halls in Japan. Sony has more amazing companies. But they are isolated, it's not aggressive to communication between these segments. So I want to say the reason why sony slipped back is not ""they couldn't be plat-former"", the true reason is ""they didn't want to fuse all their segments""."
NBE06027,"I think why sony missed is devices of sony don't have Enough compatibility. Plain example, ""Memory stick"" is it. We can't use this like ""SD card"". ""SD card"" is popular, and most of companies creating devices Positively take it's system. but sony didn't. Certainly one company create all of item is economical and making much profit. But the devices are used by many people is most important, I think."
NBE07178,We gotta make new system immediately due to the fact that some Japanese have failed. What important is to learn from the fault.
NBE06868,"I agree with you. SONY is one of Japanese proud companies. SONY's technology is not be inferior to foreign companies. I think goods made in Japan is very high-efficiency and not only the Japanese but also foreigners use them regularly, so I expect the Japanese company become ace at technology."
NBE05486,"Sony seems to think of new strategy against Amazon, Google and other companies who have interactions customers nearby. They will survey customers demands in some way, ( I don't actually know how they research it)"
NBE01137,"I was very shocked about this news story. Duchess of Cambridge must have been shocked as well. First of all, I couldn't believe the insensitivities of these DJs. The nurses in the hospital must have been busy with the pregnancy of Kate, and it's too rude to dupe people in such a situation. In addition, it was written that one of the DJs boasted what they had done and it's so ridiculous. They might truly apologize as they apprehended the gravity of the situation, but they have to know it's too late. I hope they never repeat the mistake again."
NBE01122,This news was shocking. The action that the DJs done is nonsense and foolish. I hope that they will no do these things again. Of course the DJs are to blame but I think that the nurse didn't need to kill herself.
NBE01104,"I think its surely deploring thing. However, it's difficult to specify who is responsible for the nurse's death. To be sure, those 2 radio Dj committed a joke that had gone too far. But what on earth did they expect that they would kill a person. People may not be able to condemn them too much. The most sorrowful thing is that the news of unborn prince/princess turned into something sad."
NBE01067,"I heard this radio program was not live broadcasting. I think DJs are stupid, moreover director of this program is most stupid. The director should have decide not to broadcast this bad taste program. Appropriate hoax attract people, but excessive one caused sad effect."
NBE01077,"I was sad to hear this news story. The two DJs rushed to make the hoax call, or did so without predicting that their trick call would cause her suicide. Any one can hardly foresee that this kind of hoax call would lead somebody to commit suicide. So I think, they are less responsible for her death than many people think."
NBE01112,"I think its surely deploring thing. It's difficult to specify who is responsible for the nurse's death. However, DJs and director of this program is bad and must be punished. I hope the accident like this never happen"
NBE01071,i think this news is pretty deplorable i don't know who is responsible.
NBE01097,"I think this news is very sad. Because two DJ's careless action caused suicide of one valued women. I'm sure that she is very responsible for her job. I heard the news about apologetic conference of DJs. Though they regretted and even Ms. Greig cried, I can't allow the hoax. Each people have their sense of value. So we have to consider whether an action we'll do is really right or not every time. This accident happened because It's too late to notice and I think it's serious because no one can revive this women."
NBE01103,"I knew this news before I read the article now. I was surprised because of the nurse's death. Just only telling Kate's health situation to the two DJs, she got responsible for this incident and died. I could understand the action which two DJs did, but this time, they had responsible of her death. I hope this accident shouldn't happen again."
NBE01106,"When I knew the news of two DJs' careless action at first , I didn't expect her death. So I was very surprised and shocked by her death, and felt very sad. The DJs might not intent to cause such a scene, but their action is not allowed and is punished. I hope such a scene not happen again."
NBE01076,"I was astonished at this news. I don't mean the death of the nurse. I just cannot believe such malicious mischief was really done. What they did was not just a mischief but the invasion of the patient's privacy. Generally, some media often try to get and broadcast secret information about celebrities in order to attract more customers. It's true the media have the right to search and broadcast news. But , at the same time, they also have to think highly of people's rights of privacy. This case is more serious. Naturally, hospitals are where patients are free from outside pressure and concentrate on recovering their health. But the radio hosts invaded such patient's privacy by deceiving her nurse. Few people imagine the media chase the patient even to the hospital. So, I don't think the nurse is responsible for the invasion of the patient's privacy. Instead, the radio hosts should take full responsibility."
NBE01062,"I was so shocked at this news because I've never heard such a kind of news. When I heard this news story, one question came to my head. Is DJs really to be blame for nurse's death? There may be pros and cons, but I don't think DJs are not responsible for that. They just want to heat up the radio program , of course not plan to kill her. So they were in good faith, if saying in law term. It's true that nurse's death was so sad and It was tragedy. But I do think it doesn't make sense to blame DJs or TV programmer."
NBE01127,"I was also shocked at this news. Needless to say, Mel Greig and Michael Christian intended Jacintha Saldanha no harm. I think that they just would like to direct their radio programs. However they should repent of duping""an excellent nurse"". And I knew that when we talk publicly, we have to be careful. Like this news, we may harm someone by our statements."
NBE01124,"I was shocked when I read this article. Because of DJ's foolish act, one's life lead to end. I think this nurse have very strong sense of responsibility to her job and that made her life to end. Later I found the article that these DJs receive advance notice that they would be murdered by anonymous. I think they deserve it. Reading this article remind me that one foolish act could lead to something horrible. Even if one think that's just a joke, maybe others think it seriously."
NBE01131,"It is very sad story. Of, course, the DJs conducted very stupid prank should be punished and apologize deeply for family of the nurse forever. But, I can not understand why the nurse actually committed a suicide. If I were her, I would have just quit the hospital and gone with depressed feeling. Perhaps, other nursed in the hospital condemned her for revealing the information of the condition of the queen harshly. So, the nurses in the hospital should be investigated, too."
NBE01134,"As everyone said, I also felt shocked after reading this news. As ID12048 said, I think she did not needed to kill herself. Also, I cannot understand why DJs did such a hoax thing on radio."
NBE01123,"I was shocked and disappointed after reading this news because what he did is nonsense as ID12048 said. Because of his action, she killed herself but I think that she did not need to kill herself."
NBE01129,I was shocked and surprised by her death as everyone said. She has a strong sense of responsibility but I think that it was not necessary to kill herself. DJ's action was forgivable.
NBE01126,When I heard this story I was shocked. I think two DJs did stupid thing. I think it is responsible for the two DJs.
NBE01125,"It is sad news that the nurse suicide but, in my opinion, the nurse didn't kill herself. I think she was killed by MI6 or secret service. Anyway, the DJs is stupid and they have to apologize more."
NBE01135,"I was kind of surprised to the news in the point that queen and prince has a big effect for the majority. In Japan, though we admire emperor but not really for real. I have a image that in England they admire queen so much. And i think that is the reason which caused this suicide. If the same thing happened in Japan, I think the nurse wouldn't have killed herself."
NBE01130,"I was shocked to hear this news. First I thought that the DJs were the one who should take the responsible but after the lesson, I thought that the colleagues and the chief executive have the responsible too. They should have done the after care well but they could have put all the responsible on Jacintha and that may have led her to commit suicide."
NBE01088,"After reading this news, I was surprised because this accident is unreasonable. The nurse did just her job but she felt blame and she was killed by herself. This is an irrational accident. I think this woman has no crime and the DJ must punish."
NBE01116,"I think that this incident is very sad. Probably, it was not able to expect that who brought such a result. Therefore, I cannot regard the party concerned as not much bad, either. Who is the most responsible?"
NBE01102,"I am surprised by this news story because I think her behavior is excessive. I think that hoax is also excessive. A hoax is very funny to people who watch. But, this case kill a person. I am a person who hardly doubt things. So, I angry about this news because this hoax took advantage of a victim's faith. A hoax is very funny. But, a hoax it takes advantage of his faith and kindness is the worst act."
NBE01066,"I was socked when I heard this news. These Djs did fool thing. And, I feel sorry that the nurse's life was lost. Mischief is good as long as it make people fun. I love mischiefs and I did a lot of mischief. But this mischief is mad because they cheat on people who have nothing to do with them. The Djs must express their regret and search their heart."
NBE01128,"I disagree with ID12034's idea. I think that DJs are responsible for the nurse's death. Even if DJs doesn't expect that they would kill a nurse, this behavior didn't be forgiven. They should be awoke that a little joke may cause someone's death."
NBE01078,"It's unbelievable to be suicide by a hoax call. The victim was very honest and be trusted by her colleague. Everyone was very sad that such a person passed away. If I were they, I felt the same things. I want everyone to stop a hoax call not to such a thing."
NBE01079,"First of all, I feel sorry to this news. I think DJs have to take responsible for this incident. Of course, it could be said that nurse exaggerated her thoughts. However, If DJs did not hoax to her, the accident would not be occurred. Moreover, DJs impersonated the Queen. Nurse would be vulnerable at that moment since position is important in England. Furthermore, I cannot repress astonishment that DJ seems not to be repentant."
NBE01083,"This is the unbelievable news. It was natural that the two DJs would be condemned by people and the nurse exposed a secret which is about Duchess of Cambridge's pregnancy should be also judged like two DJs. Although I do not know how confidential and important the secret was, in any case the victim's colleague; Saldanha's colleague should have kept the secret. However, we can guess the confidentiality of this secret was pretty high because Saldanha killed herself due to revealing the secret. I want to know why the two DJs pretended to be the Queen and Prince Charles. Before I read the 2nd paragraph from the bottom, I believed that they meant no harm and they just joked. However, when I read the whole article, I thought the two DJs should be punished in some form or other."
NBE01108,"We can't know what happened to the nurse's mental state after she knew that was a prank call, but the pressure may be immeasurable. The DJs should be punished for some sin, even they did it as a joke, I think."
NBE01119,"I can't believe this news, because the victim was killed by a hoax call. I think they had to think well, and I hope that they won't do such a thing again. After the accident have happened, the excuse doesn't be accepted. It is the best way that we don't such a foolish thing."
NBE01081,"When I heard this news story, I feel angry because the reason she commit suicide was so ridiculous. I think Australian radio hosts, Mel Greig and Michael Christian duped Mrs. Saldanha with light tempt to get top news. They must not expect their conduct would cause such a tragic accident. In the result, she felt heavy responsibility and committed suicide, with sadness of many people. Radio hosts were very thoughtless. They had to consider not only their benefits, but also feeling of people who was exploited. I hope that there will not be person like Mrs. Saldanha."
NBE01121,"After I came to Japan in order to study, I found that most of my friends were educated in the West. Even though I hung out with these European and American friends for a long time, some of their attitudes and opinions still made me surprised and confused. The most frequent thing that perplexes me is the Western sense of humor, namely hoaxes and sarcasm. For the first few days of hanging out with the Westerners, I usually felt offended or even cried because of their hoaxes and sarcasm. Since I was a timid person, I did not know how to react to words that made me feel uncomfortable. Because of this reason, I could not ask them about the meaning of their seemingly pointed sense of humor, thus I just felt offended, and even blamed myself a lot. Because I had felt these kinds of negative feelings towards jokes, I felt I could totally understand and sympathize with the nurse when I first saw this article. Also, Australian radio hosts, Mel Greig and Michael Christian who posed as the Queen and Prince Charles in order to inquire about the Duchess of Cambridge's health while she was being treated at the King Edward VII hospital are obviously partly responsible for nurse's suicide. But, I don't think that these kinds of accidents can be a reason to blame hoaxes or sarcasm. Even though I was often offended by this kind of humor, these days, for me, hoaxes and sarcasm among my friends is a form of communication that makes me feel that my friends and I are connected in trust and love. When I think about it, a relationship in which this kind of humor does not offend your partner is a similar process as when two people fall in love each other. For example, my mother and father have their own hoaxes and sarcasm as an expression of love. I began to think like this at the end of last November. Since I was tired of my friend's hoaxes and sarcasm, I asked them one day when I visited their place how to distinguish sarcasm and real expression. I guess since that is hard to explain, they showed me a gesture which meant 'sarcasm' and they start to use it for me when I made an uncomfortable face. Their consideration made me feel a deep sense of camaraderie. Also, I realized that sarcasm and hoaxes among friends can be an expression of friendship. For this reason, I believe that a world without hoaxes and sarcasm is the same as a world without love. Love and humor, I believe these two things are fundamentally the same."
NBE01064,"Certainly the radio DJs did silly act and their action caused the nurse's death. But I guess they never dreamed that a person would die because of their act. So I do not think only they should be criticized. Nobody understands the boundary line of the joke. However, they insulted the Queen and ""killed"" a person. So it is natural that British people get angry. I hope that this incident won't cause the fight between Australia and the U. K."
NBE01118,I was sad to hear this news. Two DJs' careless action caused such a tragic incident. They should be responsible for that took the life of one person and given severe punishment even as a joke. I think the nurse committed suicide because she felt a responsibility. Duchess of Cambridge must have been shocked as well.
NBE01068,"When I first read this story, I couldn't understand what was happening. Who can think that a woman die because of just one call of the journalists? Also, she didn't say anything bad. . . . . . like a national secret!!!! I thought DJ was silly, but at the same time I feel really sorry for him. He did a stupid thing, but it was not so bad that he should be responsible for a woman's death. I wonder why this lady committed a suicide. . . . . . . even a trusted servant of the king would not do the same thing,"
NBE01075,"This news made me sad. Though they didn't intend to do a serious mischief, I thought it couldn't be settled simply. It is because a hoax call developed into a big incident that generated a suicide. A strict measure should be adopted in order not to prevalent jokes that has gone far. However there are some people who should be pursued the issue of responsibility, producers who allowed the hoax call, for example."
NBE01114,"What a tragedy. I wonder how strong sense of responsibility she had. The DJs' act should not be forgiven. Judging from the significance of the matter, whether they intended to or not is not important, and their acts are no humor. ."
NBE01098,"It is very deplorable for the death of the nurse, Mrs Saldanha. I fell so sorry for her and I hope she will be rewarded in the heaven. So what's the problem in this issue? The death of a young lady? The hoax made by two journalists? Yes, I believe that these are very important issue that must be discussed but the problem that I would like to write here is more fundamental. The problem here is that there are many people who are waiting to hear the private issue of the individuals which they do not need to hear or waiting for the kind of news such as gossip of the celebrities. In other words, the fundamental problem lying under this issue is that there is a demand for the matters which they don't need to know. If there is a huge demand for those topics, the information will be sold at high prices and journalists or paparazzis will try to get some information about those people by any means. So this issue is about the moral of the people in the today's world. In case of Princess Diana, she died in the accident because of the paparazzis. Now, the innocent female died because of the journalists. There are many other cased that has caused death only because there are demands. So what we can do? Maybe, we need to reconsider about our daily life and be responsible for our every day acts."
NBE01084,"This news made me sad. We want to be only happy for the well beings, but because of that incident we could not to do that. I think DJs did not mean it harm, they meant it was just mischief. But they are public and has some influence, they has to have responsibility to their behavior."
NBE01069,"I didn't believe and felt sad when I heard this news. Two DJs actions were very foolish and unbelievable as human beings. I hope that the incident like this will never occur in all over the world, and want they to apologize to nurse and her families and all of her colleagues."
NBE01111,"Dj is the bad in this case. The nurse is not bad, it is not to be criticized for the act. She is just an effort to quickly convey accurate information to the royal family. This person should be a atone for the rest of one's life."
NBE01110,It is difficult for me to decide who are guilty. I think that this affairs are responsible for not only the two DJs but also the radio company and others around them. A nurse at center of duchess of Cambridge are killed by hoax call is very sad. But i think that she could not put up with to bring about detail.
NBE01099,"I was shocked to hear the news. The nurse shouldn't be criticized and commit suicide. Two DJs don't bear all responsibility. Direction has to be admitted to some extent. But in this case, it is over. They had to disclose the secret of a trick."
NBE01109,"I was really shocked to hear the news. The nurse was doing her best. The one who tricked her should be punished strictly. Although the nurse should not have leaked the information, she could not distinguish the radio dj from the one she thought. As some of the commentator mentioned, ordinary people cannot pay attention to distinguish it. I hope this kind of thing wont happen again."
NBE01120,"I was sad to hear this news. The nurse should not have killed herself. I read this news in other articles, and they says that she had a strong sense of responsibility, was trusted by the people around her, according to them. In my personal feelings, I pray for the repose of her. And I think the two DJs should be pursued their responsibilities. DJ is a position which they must take responsible for their own speaking and behaving, and DJ have strong influences to the mass. All the people who can influence many people must not forget it."
NBE01089,"It's the sad news but I think the nurse isn't wrong at all. The hospital should protect the information about patients, especially famous people. Of course, I don't think DJs are not bad, but her action had no responsibility. I don't think she had to die, but there are a big responsibility, such a punishment."
NBE01091,"Anyway strange and mysterious. Why did the nurse die? I don't know how her death relate to the hoax call, so I cannot attack the radio hosts one-sidedly. But if the hoax call triggered her death, it is so painful to each side."
NBE01133,"Like some people said above, I think that Jacintha Saldanha did not have to commit a suicide even though she was criticized a lot. She probably blamed herself too much for what she has done, but there must have been a way she could be forgiven and make amends for her work(not even a guilt). I not understand why DJs who gave a hoax call have not received any punishment even though they only 'apologized. '"
NBE01082,"I disagree with his/her comment. I also had thought that no one would be responsible for this accident, because I had thought the two DJs had no intent to harm her. However, according to this article, they took to Tweeter in an apparent boast about his actions. I do not know whether he took on Tweeter in it before her death or not. If they took on Tweeter in it after her death, they should be condemned strongly and be punished in some form. It is because they do not feel sorry and do not feel responsible for her death. They should feel responsible for it even if they had no intent to harm her when the hoax took place. However, far from feeling responsible for it, they boasted of their actions. I cannot understand their thought and they had better think their actions over."
NBE01101,"I think the nurse did not need to kill herself too. Of course, the DJs did bad things. But, I think suicide is not better action. Killing herself for the DJs is the most foolish. I think suicide as solution is wrong. The death will not solve anything."
NBE01100,"I don't know what happened there when I first watched the same news on TV because I have never heard such a sad affair. All I can do for this is praying for the repose of her soul, and wishing the affairs like this would never happen again."
NBE01063,"I disagree. I think the DJs aren't to be blamed. They just want to heat up the radio program , of course not plan to kill her."
NBE01093,"When I read this news, I was surprised very much. This news is because there are too many mysteries. I cannot understand why a nurse has died at all. However, it is unbearable that I want to know the truth of this news now. I want to look carefully in future about the trend of this news."
NBE01105,"I agree with ID12048's comment. I was shocked by this news, too. And I think as the same with her comment for the DJs and the nurse, I hope such a sad news never happen."
NBE01115,When I heard this story I was shocked. I think two DJs did stupid thing. I think it is responsible for the two DJs. I am opposed to this opinion. It is unexpected that she has died. I think that work of a program and she herself that committed suicide are responsible.
NBE01096,"This is surprising news to me. It is because bullying has become one of the biggest problems recently in Japan, too. As I see the opinions which my classmates wrote, some of them said the nurse was to blame. However, I don't think so. The male and female DJs are to blame. It is because the meaning of words depends not the intention of person who made the comment but how it is received by the listener. It also depends on the situation where conversation occur. In this situation, they could expected what they did did harm to her, if they could not expect her death. And they had to have responsibility on their comments because their comments are broadcast around the world."
NBE01094,"It is obvious that DJs are to blame on the matter. And the nurse is only a victim. Therefore, I disagree with the opinion."
NBE01095,She wrote her experience about the matter. And she says difference between cultures affects how people receive comments. It's an interesting opinion.
NBE01070,"i especially agree with this sentence""who is responsible for the nurse's death"". i also hope the accident like this never happen. so i strongly agreed with this comment."
NBE01061,"This news story looks common story of fraud. But this news is important because this made people know problems of journalism. Of course, this news is important. So this should be known by people and journalists have duty to report. BUt this news made me think about way of reporting. Are there any other way which doesn't let the nurse kill herself?The journalists should understand risk to make people who is reported feel sad . But reporters are needed to criticize the guilt of involved people. It is difficult to balance between criticizing and thinking about the people who is reported. The first ability which is needed for journalists is this way of balancing."
NBE01085,"There are many issues in the case. In the issues, I will talk about two points; moral and responsibility. Firstly, in this case, two DJs lacked a sense of morality. They cannot distinguish what they can do with what they must not do. There may be people who condemned the nurse because the nurse leaked a secret. But this hoax is vicious. There are programs in which people imitate famous people. However, though these programs don't influence work place that people who are played a hoax work, this hoax influenced. This hoax is same as imposture. If so, we cannot condemn the nurse. Secondly, cooperation has to have a responsibility. After the case occurred, CEO of the radio company told the public that this hoax is not illegal. But what CEO said is that he only protected his company and didn't take the responsibility. This is because the company conceded the imposture in public. Even the upper levels of the company are about to escape from the responsibility. They didn't notice the importance of the case and intend to dispose of the case by only dismissal of two DJs. I strongly believe that such a company doesn't have a right to use radio broadcasting."
NBE01073,I also think we should consider what journalism ought to do when I knew this news.
NBE01074,"To be sure, the nurse did just her job and the emcees' action was impermissible. But I think she was completely innocent. I think her action that telling them how Kate was doing was not a little hasty."
NBE01086,This news make me feel shocked and angry. Nurses is very busy looking after patients every day. This work which treat people's lives is sacredness. However this incident which the nurse was duped by two DJ and died is inadmissible. I believe incidents like this never happen.
NBE01065,"I can't agree with him. We shouldn't jump to a conclusion. Surely if we judge from a result, only the DJ's have to be punished. But we must consider social background of the affair. Hoax call have been a part of TV and radio entertainment programs since the 1950s. And this may be the first time hoax call caused death. So they must have never dreamed that they would ""kill"" a person. I don't think only they should be criticized. Depending on viewpoint, it is possible for us even to say that they met with misfortune. So he should think more about who is response, and what is humor."
NBE01090,I was surprised and shocked when I read this article. Because the nurse has died suicide. I didn't know why she so felt responsibility. I can't allow that DJs. I hope that such incident will not happen again.
NBE01072,"It is a pity that the case happened. Who can predict that a woman die because of a hoax call? I think that the DJs did not imagine either. Of cause, they are very silly, but I felt pity for them. I think that they work to reach mass audience interesting news, so they did such a silly action for their business. However, ironically that caused a woman's death. I think better that they could interest mass audience in other ways."
NBE01080,"When I heard this news, I was very shocked. The nurse didn't wrong. She didn't need to kill herself. The two DJs virtually kill her. They deserve to be criticized for having said such a things on twitter."
NBE01092,"Saldanha's death made me so sad. But I couldn't angry with the two DJ's so much though an innocent nurse committed a suicide. It was natural for her to believe that two DJ's saying, so that I cannot criticize her. And I guess her death was beyond their thought, so that I feel sorry for two DJ's. But what they did was indirect homicide. As a result, this incident couldn't say a mere joke."
NBE01107,"He mentions of the feeling of Duchess of Cambridge, so he can think of the feelings of others. I think THAT was very important for this incident. I think the DJs could not do that, so they killed an innocent nurse as a result."
NBE01117,This news is very sad. A woman committed suicide by two DJ's action. I think public people have to be more carefully to own statement and activity.
NBE01132,"I feel so sorry for the nurse who commit suicide as she must have been put under so much pressure. Even if the nurse did not commit suicide, I still think this is a stupid thing to do and it should not happen again."
NBE01138,"He is saying same point with me. I agree with the thought that the nurse had very strong sense of responsibility to her job and it made her life to end. She didn't have defection at all, and two DJs should be charged strictly."
NBE01139,"I couldn't believe this news at first. It was like an ackamaracka that one person died because of a prank call. It was too sad news, and I feel sorry about the nurse who was very responsible person. At the same instant, I can't forgive the two DJs who trick the nurse and crucify her on Twitter. They don't have personal moral, so wish they would be punished strictly."
NBE01140,There is not only mentally strong people in the world. To tell about condition of duchess in a hospital could be a big regret for one citizen. I can understand her responsibility and feeling of apology. So I disagree with this comment.
NBE01113,"ID12011's comment on the article of suicide of nurse. DJs invaded the safe place, so in that sense they are also blamed."
NBE01087,I also hope these accident happen again because the nurse has no responsible to die.
NBE01136,I strongly agree with this comments because i also think that even though DJs felt truly sorry it is too late now because they have lost a person because of their heartless jokes. I hope that medias will find a good way to never repeat the mistake again.
NBE01634,"I think these two radio hosts are so sinful that they should be judged by the law. First, the phone call they had made forced the nurse to die. I think their behaviors are equal to murder. And more, Mel Greig told the nurse that she was Queen Erizabeth. It is perjury. Maybe they thought it is only a prank call, but their frivolous behaviors cause a serious matter. We have to think a dividing line between prank and crime seriously."
NBE02134,"First, I think this problem is easy to understand and two DJs committed a crime. But, is that true?We should think the mass media's crime, too. The mass media gives us many amusements and knowledge, so we think it is useful and safe. However , it is able to kill people easily by disinformation like this case. It is easy to finish this case by blaming two DJs. Though, we must think the mass media again from this case."
NBE02497,"This news makes me very sad. First of all, the hoax call that the DJs did should not be overlooked. I think the media do not care about the method they use for obtaining information, and their actions might cause Jacintha Saldanha's death. In addition, her family and friends must be very sad. Even if their action have nothing to do with her death, those who around her condemn their actions. This news make me recognize that I should not do tease others lightly. I hope they make the same mistake."
NBE01413,"I think this news is really sad. I think what those two journalists do are not so good. In my opinion , journalists should know their position well and behave correctly."
NBE02331,"When I read this news, I was really shocked. This is because I can expert Mrs Saldanha is an excellent nurse and well-respected and popular with all of her colleagues as chief of the hospital said. Also I feel anger for the DJ. Things what they did were unforgivable."
NBE02190,"This is shocking news. Twitter sometimes use in crimes. We should be careful to use media such as Twitter, FaceBook. The nurse is pitiable."
NBE02692,I'm sad because it can say SNS killed the norse. I think it is the worse suspect of the SNS.
NBE01146,"JT006 17, 2012 - 03:10am JST The Japanese people who voted for the LDP and Ishihara are living in cloud cuckoo land. Back to the bad old days of patriotic education, visits to Yasukini, changing the Constitution, building more airports in the middle of nowhere, denying The Rape of Nanjing, teachers being forced to salute the Hinomaru and stand for the Kimigayo, maybe even the return of the Thought Police? Japan getting the nuclear bomb. yes, a great day for old Japan. The beginning of the end. I think this comment is quite radical. I want to vote for PLD, but I do not have right to vote. I do not want to go back to the time like WW2. But Japan must power up military power in order to compete with China and North Korea. This general election is last chance to save this country. This comment is irrelevance."
NBE01211,"I am totally agree with opinion of JT010. Even result of Japanese election had expected, I was quite surprised about the news that LDP - which overlooked 3.11disaster- won the election. Many intellectuals of Japan and another country expected Japan will have a big change because of 3.11 disaster. And actually, there was a change in Japanese society like democratic action. Even though That kind of democratic action is usual in another country, I cannot say that is little change of Japan. Compare with before, there was big change in Japanese society indeed. But what I want to say is, Japanese civilization could not make meaningful change. In democratic society, Only result of election have meaning. And I think this situation - Japanese citizen could not make their political will as a result of election- is crisis of Japanese democracy. An addition, Japanese should think about another country which damaged by radioactive gushed in Atomic generation of Fukushima. Damaged by radioactive is not only problem of Japanese. That is also harmful for neighbor countries of Japan. Finally, I think it is the time that Japanese should think about relation with another countries. Japan cannot get along with other asian countries with arrogant policy of LDP"
NBE01182,"SushiSake3Dec. 16, 2012 - 09:49pm JST Everything happens for a reason, although not necessarily a good one(s). This comment shows the result of this election briefly. I guess many voters consider that DPJ was bad, it is natural for DPJ to lose. But they don't think that LDP is good, though they voted for LDP, and LDP won. Many voters still have negative image for LDP, but there is no other choice but to vote for LDP. The result was not welcomed. Everything happens for a reason, although not necessarily a good one."
NBE01195,"I agree with ID12025. I think many voters didn't have any party which they want to support. The didn'T have any choice about voting, so they couldn't be helped to vote to LDP. I became 20th years old in this year, so I went to vote at the first time yesterday. I didn't have any interesting about Japanese government before, but now, I entered as an ""adult"" and I tried to watch News about voting or listen parties' speech. As Japanese, we should have more attention to Japanese government and change the bad economy as soon as possible with LDP."
NBE01178,"JimizoDec. 17, 2012 - 12:18am JST An abject failure the first time around and then leads his party to a landslide victory in a choice between losers, nutcases and non-entities. I suppose someone had to win. I disagree this issue. All of the Parties including the Liberal Democratic Party are classified in losers, nutcases and non-entities and all of them don't think about Japan. I think The Liberal Democratic Party is the Party which is not wanted to win but have to win."
NBE01157,"Nathaw Dec. 17, 2012 - 08:33am JST Abe economic policy is Spend, Borrow and More debt. If he can not pay the debt, he will borrow more. Japan real debt is more than 200% of GDP. Unlike Greece, the debt belong to locals not foreigners. However it there is a default or does not meet the bond obligation, there will be a exodus of capital flight. His policy is fairy tale and can not sustain for a long term. I agree with Nathaw. Abe's economic policy is excessively drastic. Other than spending so much money on public enterprises, he also plants to revise the law of Bank of Japan in order to boost economic growth. Such a policy can rather give bad effect on Japanese economy by causing awful inflation. The law plays an important role in preventing extreme inflation by inhibiting the central bank from buying the government bonds directly from the government. If the central bank is allowed to issue limitless amount of money and compelled to buy government bonds, extravagant finance is also accelerated. The more finance deficit is accumulated, the worse inflation gets, results in default. So, even if this policy gives good effect on Japanese economy by leading inflation, the benefit is temporary. Instead, it can do harm to the economy. He should aware that there is enormous demerit in the economic policy."
NBE01214,"I agree with ID12025. Comments and article itself shows that people are not accepting LDP, but because they don't want to vote to DPJ. There are people who oppose LDP in the comments. However, exclude China and Korea, many Asia countries and United States praise the election of LDP. To Asian countries, they fear China and Korea's rapid military expansion. LDP announce that they would create Self-Defense Force, that could collective defense with allies where Japan is not directly related. To Asian countries, Japan's military expansion are something helpful for them. To Unites States, once officer told that it's used to be said that elect of LDP would make Japan right-wing, but actually Japan used to be left-wing, and elect of LDP would make it neutral. As my opinion, I'm somewhat worried about Abe's Economic Policy. I think it's too optimistic. Many experts said that his policy would boost inflation. Japan's economy is not stable even now. To make such a big action would collapse everything. Also, it's not only about LDP nor DPJ, I want Prime Minister to complete at least their first term as Prime Minister. I think too many changes of Prime Minister and their policy made Economic worse. Economy used to be unstable and rapid change of policy are ruining Economy."
NBE01222,"Frequency of the times the president changes in Japan is crazy. Where in the world changes the president seven times in 6 years. I think it is only the country, Japan. I do not see any good changes by switching the presidents. If they want to change the country, the people, and etc, they should keep the president for the time being. President Abe actually got the second chance to lead Japan, Maybe, he will be changed sooner or later."
NBE01205,"JT004 17, 2012 - 08:14am JST Article says 59% voter turnout. Better than I thought. I agree with this opinion. I was not so interested in this election, either. Especially this is caused by that neither interest nor expectation has a young man in the latest politics. Therefore, I think that this voter turnout is the somewhat higher one. In order to raise, future politics needs to be substantial."
NBE01194,"Dennis BauerDec. 17, 2012 - 10:27am JST It doesn't matter which party you choose, the system is set in stone, the bureaucracy will mill on the same, whoever is in charge. I don't see any major changes happen anytime soon I agree with this opinion. I think a change of the party in power does not make a change for society. But, I cannot understand people who do not go to the election by this reason. Certainly, it may not make any change. But, we should not reconcile the government because I think this act connects an indifferent to the government. So, we should make use of suffrage."
NBE01212,"I'm really happy that LDP got back the politic power again. Among this 3 years Japan got weak. I hope that Mr. Abe will change Japan. Some people mention that president change is a bad thing . In my opinion, I don't care. Because Japan is different from other country, there is an emperor in the middle. Although, I was worried that when the political power was in the DPJ. Because they don't care about the emperor. I think the mass media is horrible in Japan. The mass media has brainwashed many Japanese people so that many people can't judge the right way."
NBE01196,"Dennis BauerDec. 17, 2012 - 10:27am JST It doesn't matter which party you choose, the system is set in stone, the bureaucracy will mill on the same, whoever is in charge. I don't see any major changes happen anytime soon. I disagree to his opinion because there are already a little signs of an economic recovery, which we can't see during (at least) the last 3 years. Even if it is based only on expectations for the new leader, the fact is that rising the price of stocks is making big benefits for companies and hole economy. I hope that this time he surely makes a difference for Japan."

His policy is fairy tale and can not sustain for a long term. I agree with this comment. Japan has too many depts. PM Abe told that government would increase them and grow up economy. But if the plan fail, how will Japan recover? I'm afraid that Japan loses the trust of many other foreign countries."
NBE01227,"After LDP took the control of Japanese Government, it was broadcast that strong yen stopped and gradually shifting to weaker yen, in addition the share prices are rising in Japan. These are necessary for Japan to recover from recent economic depression. We cannot say that good situation last forever, but at least we can find hope. I hope this fact will encourage people not to be disappointed about economic situation."
NBE01220,I expected that the Democratic party would manage Japanese politics successfully but it was a disappointment. I hope that Abe's LDP would manage economic policy more successfully and resolve diplomacy problem.
NBE01159,"Everything happens for a reason, although not necessarily a good one(s). I expect quite a few voters had no party for which they would stand. Many voters think DPJ was wrong, but they don't necessarily regard LDP as the next ruling party. There is no other choice, so they voted for LDP. In my own opinion, once Shinzo Abe resigned prime minister just because ""he had stomach ache "" irresponsibly. He do not deserve to be the next prime minister."
NBE01219,"I thought that the Democratic Party divided into two factions over the question about a consumption tax. In 2011, finally, 14 assemblymen left the party. I agree with ID12055. I also expect that LDP would recover business conditions. For that, Mr. Abe should have a sense of a responsibility and LDP must act in a body."
NBE01203,"JT005 16, 2012 - 09:03pm JST Now taking bets. . . . will Abe last a full year? I say 10 months. I am sad to see this comment. Actually the Prime Minister in Japan changes so quickly by turn. However, I would like him to have a hope. Liberty party has govern Japan for many times expect last two or three years. So i think Abe will not quit his position."
NBE01218,"Her opinion is same as me. Mr. Abe take the relationship between Japan and USA very seriously. I expect that LDP get ""The Japanese key"" in this year."
NBE01198,"Thomas Anderson Dec. 16, 2012 - 08:52pm JST 41% voted. . . pathetic. No one cares about anything despite the big hullabaloo about the nuclear accident. GOOD JOB JAPAN, YOU WIN NO PRIZE. I think this result of turnout cannot be helped to be amazed by foreign people. The ""apathy"" to politics of Japanese people is serious. I think they should lower the age to obtain the right to vote, and to enable young people take interest to politics."
NBE01225,"I agree with the ID12058's opinion. It is true that switching prime minister doesn't change anything. Actually it just making everything slow and worse, because every prime minister says and tries different thing each time, so they never finishes what they told to us that they are going to do on the first day of prime minister."
NBE01208,"It doesn't matter which party you choose, the system is set in stone, the bureaucracy will mill on the same, whoever is in charge. I don't see any major changes happen anytime soon I agree with this comment. I don't feel any changes yet. These days, in Japan, the minister have changed many times, but I don't feel the changes. And I think because of it, almost of people can't expect too much of the minister."
NBE01143,"This is less a vote for the LDP than a vote against the DPJ and their failure to live up to their promises in their so called ""manifesto"". One problem is that Ishinnokai, Ishihara's and Hashimoto's party very well could win more seats than the DPJ which is an even bigger problem waiting in the wings. I've talked to a number of people about this election and many see no option other than the LDP which will bring back an era of unbridled public spending. I also think there are a lot of vote against the DPJ, and many people seems to have thought there was no reliable party other than LDP. But I think the situation that Ishinnokai won many seats isn't problem. At the present time, Ishinnokai is unreliable party. But I think this party will stimulate other parties including the DPJ and the LDP. I think that appearance of Ishinnokai may be a chance to change politics of Japan. Though I don't know whether it changes better or worse."
NBE01197,"JT009 Dec. 16, 2012 - 08:47pm JST Japan is its own worst enemy. When, when, when will they learn?? I was interested in this comment. Prime minister changes 7th times in 6 years in Japan. It is very serious problem. I hope Abe will conduct stable and reliable politics for people."
NBE01167,"JT001DEC. 16, 2012 - 09:23pm JST I knew the the LDP would gain seats, but I thought that there would be a little more balance. Way to go selfish (older) voters. . . People over 60 already control 90% of Japan's wealth. This imbalance will just get worse as younger workers pay for older retired people (collecting on ave. an excess of ¥ 39,620,000 in pension benefits above what they paid in). Also who will fight the battles that Abe will hope to start? I think this comment is one truth of Japan nowadays. The most of people voted was over 60. So, old people have politician right more than young people. . . , but who lead Japan's future is young people. I would like Abe take the reins of government for not only getting many votes but also bringing up Japan's future. Of course, young people should vote more and more activity not to be ignored."
NBE01149,Article says 59% voter turnout. Better than I thought I agree with this comment. I have no interest in politics and I know that recent young people have tendency to have lower interest in it. So this 59% was a little shock for me. I thought the turnout would be more low number.
NBE01204,"Shamhei SakaiDEC. 16, 2012 - 11:37pm JST Chill guys. There'll be another election next year. . . and the year after. . . . and the year after that. . . . I reluctantly agree with this sarcasm. I wonder how many people in foreign country know who is the current prime minister of Japan. ."

I don't see any major changes happen anytime soon I agree with this opinion in terms of ""I don't see any major changes happen anytime soon"". In the election, most people didn't vote for the manifest of LDP. People voted just as the result of eliminating other parties. Also, the truth is that the LDP didn't make progression on increasing their votes rather the votes are split among other parties such as Ishinnokai or Democratic Party. Another realities we must face is that the voting rate of young generations are declining. Here underlies the problem. Unless the nations decided what direction they wanted the country to go on, we cannot improve our country and, in the end, it will become corrupted. So more and more people, particularly young people, need to have more interests in the politics, economics and social affairs and think more, discuss more for the future of Japan. Don't be passive. Be active."
NBE01171,"Even if I didn't support all of Noda's thinking, there was some hope left, somehow. Not anymore. At least a lot of things are clearer now. Japan is on the wrong path for good. It's people will suffer even more and for nothing but the well being of the politicians and their amakudari friends. Sad day for Japan. I really wonder how the LDP voters will react in the next months. . . desperate and disillusioned. I agree with that comment. It has passed only 3 years form the Minshuto won the election. 3 years is too short to evaluate them. For changing the regime and systems and something else, 3 years is not enough. Above all, a lot of wrong things that LDP had caused for so long time needs more time to be cured. The only thing I do is to believing that LDP is changed."
NBE01142,"It doesn't matter which party you choose, the system is set in stone, the bureaucracy will mill on the same, whoever is in charge. I don't see any major changes happen anytime soon This comment seems a little radical, but I agree. Looking back on these years, what party and who assume the reins of government doesn't matter. I myself don't take side with one party. Whether or not the election was end in success is judged a few years later."
NBE01150,"SushiSake3Dec. 16, 2012 - 09:49pm JST Everything happens for a reason, although not necessarily a good one(s). I think it is very nice comment to the result of this election.

For example, island dispute, nuclear power plant, deficit financing, and revival of west Japan. But, people who participated in the election was only 41% of Japanese! This is regrettable situation. I am worried about future of this country."
NBE01190,I agree with JT001. Whether a party wins or loses depends on the old. So each party tries to attract them affection. Policy tends to ignore the young and they become indifferent. This is the problem. Young people should have interest and the government should strive to attract them.
NBE01201,Shinzo Abe was disappointedly lost his position. But he returned with strength and cleverness. I think he is the only person who can improve Japanese politics and strengthen Japan. I expect him for economic recovery that the other parties couldn't achieve.

They believe that if Japanese economy grows such as rapid economic growth, we can escape the deflationary spiral. But it is really impossible. No developed country grows 10% GDP. In order to grow economy, LDP is about to redeem government bonds and increase the deficit. By now though Japanese government reduce the deficit, LDP will add to it with Japanese center bank. I am worried about Japanese future."

NBE01177,I think this result shows that Japanese people can be affected and change their mind easily. Because we chose Democratic Party to promote good economy. This Liberal democratic Party's victory caused by our expectation to promote Japanese economy.
NBE01155,"wanderlust Dec. 17, 2012 - 02:11am JST Naoto Kan was PM for 14 months. I don't think Abe will last a year, the LDP are probably already deciding who will be next in the big seat, when the new PM's popularity will drop to around 20%, as it inevitably will. . . . I don't think so. The strong yen rate is being redressed and the price of stocks is rising. I suppose this fact proves that the policy or the executive power of LDP are expected. To be sure, Mr. Abe relinquished government about five years ago. But we should estimate the new government after seeing how they're working. There are, indeed, a little anxiety in my mind."
NBE01156,"I'm in favor of ID12028. The Japanese finance debt is twice more than GDP and the largest in the world. Now most of government bonds is bought by Japanese people and they can continue to buy the bonds, so the bonds keep the trust in the market. But if Abe accelerates the issue of government debt, the bonds may lose the trust in market. More steady finance is needed."

I support this opinion. Japan has so far been dependent on nuclear power. Now, it cannot be lost. It is little although there is also a method of alternative energy. So, Japan must depend on nuclear power."
NBE01181,"i don't think Japan will change whoever would become prime minister. But I have little knowledge about politics in Japan so I cannot say anything about it. So I should study harder about it, and wanna be a good participant in government of Japan."
NBE01158,"This comment is almost the same as mine in many points. Many voters had no party for which they would stand. They think DPJ was wrong, but they don't necessarily regard LDP as the next ruling party. There is no other choice, so they voted for LDP. ""Everything happens for a reason, although not necessarily a good one. """
NBE01200,"I think that Abe Shinzo is very lucky. When he was a prime minister, he formerly resigned the job for his health problem reason. Regardless of his previous failure, he did the LDP leader and Japanese people voted not the DPJ but the LDP. It is very important for him and the LDP to solve the domestic problems such as the economic problem, the financial problem, the educational problem and the diplomatic problem. In addition, I think that existence of the third parties will be key. Cooperationing The Nipponishin party and the Minna party with the DPJ will enable the LDP stimulate."
NBE01209,"It doesn't matter which party you choose, the system is set in stone, the bureaucracy will mill on the same, whoever is in charge. I don't see any major changes happen anytime soon I agree with this comment. I don't feel any changes yet. These days, in Japan, the minister have changed many times, but I don't feel the changes. And I think because of it, almost of people can't expect too much of the minister."
NBE01217,"Frequency of the times the president changes in Japan is crazy. Where in the world changes the president seven times in 6 years. I think it is only the country, Japan. I do not see any good changes by switching the presidents. If they want to change the country, the people, and etc, they should keep the president for the time being. President Abe actually got the second chance to lead Japan, Maybe, he will be changed sooner or later. I agree this comment. In Japan president change like once a year and I don't understand why president change so much. I think it is meaningless even if the president change."
NBE01224,"To be honest, I am not very good at politics and do not quite understand how the current system of the government runs. However, I can see a ridiculousness in frequent president change in Japan. Because of this, we Japanese citizens are always confused and worried about our country's future. Plus, It is a problem that every time we have a different one, he is somewhere criticized and demanded. I would like to insist here that the Japanese government does not have even a second to waste by disputing inside the country. Otherwise, Japan will definitely stop developing and be left behind by other countries in the world."
NBE01216,"Frequency of the times the president changes in Japan is crazy. Where in the world changes the president seven times in 6 years. I think it is only the country, Japan.

In Japan president change like once a year and I don't understand why president change so much. I think it is meaningless even if the president change."
NBE01221,"Shinzo Abe became the seventh prime minister in 6 years. This must be an awful number and to make Japan change, I think time is needed. You can't do anything that turns out to be positive in a short time and people must wait a little for the thing to happen. It isn't that easy to change the country we must know that. We don't know what would happen to Abe but we must trust him to make Japan change."
NBE01215,I voted on his party so I want him to go for it. He quit prime minister once in pass and now he has a second chance and he can not fail this time.
NBE01169,"Thomas AndersonDec. 16, 2012 - 10:27pm JST Be interesting to see what happens between Japan and China. I think the good news is that Abe is two-faced. . . China is actually hopeful that Abe will restore the relation between China and Japan. The bad news is that he is pro-nuclear! And a whole bunch of other things that are not good for Japan. I agree with his thoughts. First of all, diplomacy is one of the most important things that Abe should deal with, there are a lot of problems in Japan though. I hope that Japan will solve the territorial dispute between not only China also Korea. It is a frequent occurrence which one country has a dispute with neighbor country. So, I believe these three countries will get over the insignificant and meaningless dispute without any wars and without any blood. I don't know how, but I wish, just having a conversation. We have to have a conversation about the territory with honor and tolerance. Besides, I disagree with the policy which nuclear power plant will not halt even in the future. Although it is not good that just says ""Stop the nuclear power plant"", these people do not consider how to product huge power by other ways. If we want to halt it, we have to suggest the new way in the substitution for nuclear. However, this is very difficult question. There are a lot of earthquake and volcano in Japan. I think geothermal power generation is good for the substitution for the nuclear. Or I wish someone hit on a good idea. By the way, People who voted to LDP did not think LDP was good for the ruling party. They thought DPJ was too bad and they voted to LDP because they did not have any other choices. Recently, I have seen the new presidents in America and Korea and I think it is also better for Japan to elect a president. It is because there is no charismatic Prime Minister and people who became PM in these days would not decide anything. So, we are requiring a person who can decide various things."

NBE01147,"I expect of him. He declared to improve the market, and acted actually. I think the most priority policy is about the market. Many problem ; diplomacy, constitution, nuclear power, etc. should be put off. In place of DPJ, LDP have to advance Japan."
NBE01192,"It doesn't matter which party you choose, the system is set in stone, the bureaucracy will mill on the same, whoever is in charge. I don't see any major changes happen anytime soon I agree with this opinion. I think a change of the party in power does not make a change for society. But, I cannot understand people who do not go to the election by this reason. Certainly, it may not make any change. But, we should not reconcile the government because I think this act connects an indifferent to the government. So, we should make use of suffrage."
NBE01193,"I disagree this opinion. If it becomes like this opinion, we will be in trouble. Many Japanese are bored of the government. So, I think Abe can not make mistakes. There are a lot of problems because of recent a few years politics. But, I think the government must not become the Right Wing. And, I expect Abe to restore economic."
NBE01160,"I'm just glad that Japan isn't going to renounce nuclear power. Oh and the whole LDP inflation target thing is a pretty solid idea too. I support this opinion. Japan has so far been dependent on nuclear power. Now, it cannot be lost. It is little although there is also a method of alternative energy. So, Japan must depend on nuclear power. JT003 16, 2012 - 10:21pm JST Don't worry people. . . not much will change. Oh wait, that's what we should be worried about! Well, no good change is likely IMHO. Be interesting to see what happens between Japan and China. I disagree with this opinion. Although Japan may hardly change, isn't it required for the present people to believe change? I hope Prime Minister Abe causes some reform."
NBE01144,"I think the Abe government will last long more than a year. People and companies and other country dislike frequent change of prime minister. In recent years, many prime ministers appeared and disappeared. And this made big loss of economy and politics. I want the Abe government to last long time. And abenomics is succeeding. His popularity will not drop."
NBE01145,"The Japanese people who voted for the LDP and Ishihara are living in cloud cuckoo land. Back to the bad old days of patriotic education, visits to Yasukini, changing the Constitution, building more airports in the middle of nowhere, denying The Rape of Nanjing, teachers being forced to salute the Hinomaru and stand for the Kimigayo, maybe even the return of the Thought Police? Japan getting the nuclear bomb. yes, a great day for old Japan. The beginning of the end. I think this comment is quite radical. I want to vote for PLD, but I do not have right to vote. I do not want to go back to the time like WW2. But Japan must power up military power in order to compete with China and North Korea. This general election is last chance to save this country. This comment is irrelevance."
NBE01166,"I knew the the LDP would gain seats, but I thought that there would be a little more balance. Way to go selfish (older) voters. . . People over 60 already control 90% of Japan's wealth. This imbalance will just get worse as younger workers pay for older retired people (collecting on ave. an excess of ¥ 39,620,000 in pension benefits above what they paid in). Also who will fight the battles that Abe will hope to start? I think this comment is one truth of Japan nowadays. The most of people voted was over 60. So, old people have politician right more than young people. . . , but who lead Japan's future is young people. I would like Abe take the reins of government for not only getting many votes but also bringing up Japan's future. Of course, young people should vote more and more activity not to be ignored."
NBE01162,"I think Abe's pledges can agreed by Japanese but not other countries. He said that he will magnify the Self-Defense Forces. In Korea, people are worrying about increasing Self-Defense Forces because they can be a threat to Korea's security. In fact, many Koreans are worrying about Abe's Conservative pace. I suggest him to be more ponder about international relations. Furthermore, I attend to the fact that he once inaugurated the Prime Minister just for one year. I want to say that Japanese political trends being stable as soon as possible."
NBE01184,"Abe was picked by the Japanese Prime Minister, but I expect it as expected, and I think whether it is good. The Prime Ministers were changed in sequence these past around five years, and was stable; is because cannot govern it. Prime Minister Abe is the election of the second , but He carries out a manifesto, and can you accomplish a splendid great achievement?I pray as one of the Japanese citizens for the Prime Minister accomplishing a great achievement."
NBE01185,"Certainly, LDP won the election and the party will roll Japan again. However, I doubt if People in Japan are hopeful about the party. I think they voted for it negatively. It means we can no more entrust DPJ with politics. LDP will be faced many problems to solve."
NBE01213,I think that the news which LDP won the election is good for Japan even though a great number of people including me think LDP would not change a lot. I did not want DPJ to continue anymore because it had not changed the things.
NBE01170,"Even if I didn't support all of Noda's thinking, there was some hope left, somehow. Not anymore. At least a lot of things are clearer now. Japan is on the wrong path for good. It's people will suffer even more and for nothing but the well being of the politicians and their amakudari friends. Sad day for Japan. I really wonder how the LDP voters will react in the next months. . . desperate and disillusioned. I agree with that comment. It has passed only 3 years form the Minshuto won the election. 3 years is too short to evaluate them. For changing the regime and systems and something else, 3 years is not enough. Above all, a lot of wrong things that LDP had caused for so long time needs more time to be cured. The only thing I do is to believing that LDP is changed."
NBE01210,"41% voted. . . pathetic. No one cares about anything despite the big hullabaloo about the nuclear accident. GOOD JOB JAPAN, YOU WIN NO PRIZE. We have to be more serious about this circumstance that the rate of voting is too low. I think that this opinion is the very thought people around the world have. They look us like this. Japanese must not take it easy as we are not concerned about politics. Particularly young people should go to vote in this age of a declining birthrate and aging population. Like this comment, Japan will be ruined if things are going on."
NBE01172,"I strongly disagree with the opinion that Japan must have the military power. we Japanese have the constitution especially, Article 9. we cannot have the military power. But LDP change the constitution and have great military power. Finally, LDP may be about to break into war. So this comment is contradiction."
NBE01154,"Naoto Kan was PM for 14 months. I don't think Abe will last a year, the LDP are probably already deciding who will be next in the big seat, when the new PM's popularity will drop to around 20%, as it inevitably will. . . . I don't think so. The strong yen rate is being redressed and the price of stocks is rising. I suppose this fact proves that the policy or the executive power of LDP are expected. To be sure, Mr. Abe relinquished government about five years ago. But we should estimate the new government after seeing how they're working. There are, indeed, a little anxiety in my mind."
NBE01191,"There's a sentence said ""He would be Japan's seventh prime minister in six-and-a-half years. "", I think this shows one of the causes of Japan's recent political turmoil. No one can achieve anything in a short time. We have to trust the Cabinet we chose and made through the vote, and let them work more."
NBE01174,"Thomas AndersonDec. 16, 2012 - 10:27pm JST Be interesting to see what happens between Japan and China. I think the good news is that Abe is two-faced. . . China is actually hopeful that Abe will restore the relation between China and Japan. The bad news is that he is pro-nuclear! And a whole bunch of other things that are not good for Japan. I am worried about the relationship between Japan and China. China has many people and these days develops. And now, Japan depends on America and China by every side. So Japan should make good relationship with China. I think Abe is being put to the test, with everyone waiting to see how the relationship is changing. Abe won the election the second time. I'm also interested in which results Abe leads Japan to good or to bad."
NBE01141,"Honestly, I was surprised when I heard LDP won the election and couldn't believe that result. Thinking about the result of the last election, which LDP completely lost, and the LDP's activities after the election, I had no ideas to think that LDP recover the trust of Japanese citizen. But I've got it, when I saw the voting percentage. It is truth that LDP won the election but the number of votes that LDP obtained didn't change. After consideration about the decrease of the voting percent, the supporters of the LDP didn't increase. I am interested in the manner of the LDP after this election. Seeing the election returns, the winner can't think confidently that much of the citizens believe in them. To recover the trust, they should lend the ears to other parties , for example, the party of Ishinn."
NBE01180,"I think that this result was good one for Japan and the Japanese. I don't know the details about Japanese politics, but know about Japan-China relationship. I have heard that a certain Japanese had gone to volunteer in China and killed. When I heard story, I was very shocked. In the future, I hope that Japan-China relation will be better."
NBE01148,Article says 59% voter turnout. Better than I thought I agree with this comment. I have no interest in politics and I know that recent young people have tendency to have lower interest in it. So this 59% was a little shock for me. I thought the turnout would be more low number.
NBE01152,"I agree with his comment. I think that temporary restoration of economy is meaningless. The government has to keep the restoration. But, it is not easy to do that. Therefore, as he said, I hope LDP's election encourage people not to be disappointed about economic situation."
NBE01153,"Last year, I became 20 years old, and I got the right to vote as an adult. Then, I am more interested in the politics. I think that economic policy is one of the most influence factors which control the election. LDP emphasized it, and the Japanese people expected. As a result, LDP won a victory in the election. After it, strong yen stopped and is shifting to weaker yen, in addition the Nikkei Stock average is rising. However, it is a pity that Voter turnout was around 59%. I think that Japanese must not forget that we have a duty participating in the politics. I want Japanese to be more interested in it. And, I hope that the government responds our expectation."
NBE01163,"I was surprised this 41% voted. This percentage is the worst number after WWII. Recently, Japan have so many complicated problems. For example, island dispute, nuclear power plant, deficit financing, and revival of west Japan. But, people who participated in the election was only 41% of Japanese! This is regrettable situation. I am worried about future of this country."
NBE01164,"I'm against nuclear power. I think human can't handle nuclear power perfectly. If we continue using nuclear power, sometime we will get terrible damage. Why don't LDP renounce nuclear power?I think human life is important than money."
NBE01183,"I think so, too. The prime minister should be more careful for his remark. Japanese prime ministers had to resign due to their making a gaffe."
NBE01206,"This news makes me happy. I don't expect democratic party's policy and members. But, LDP's policy will give Japanese economic good effect."
NBE01223,I do not think it is suitable for someone who has been president in the past to become president again. He was put down for a reason last time he was president. If Abe can change Japan he would have made it an even better place while he was president in the past.
NBE01199,I cannot just say it is a good thing. Of course there is a good thing. But there is also a bad thing like changing a constitution as he mentioned. We need to observe the situation seriously.
NBE01228,"I agree with this comment. "" Everything happens for a reason, although not necessarily a good one(s). "" Abe became Prime Minister again, but public opinion was severe to him. First of all, anti-nuclear became popular in Japan today, but LDP is not supposed to stop nuclear plants. So many parties were established right before election, asserting abolish of nuclear plant. However, as an election, it looks dangerous to bet to new small parties. By failing of another big party DPJ, people had to choose LDP, another big party. You might not to be able to say that they really hoped LDP's revival. Abe is needed more effort than first time, from the beginning."
NBE01175,"An abject failure the first time around and then leads his party to a landslide victory in a choice between losers, nutcases and non-entities. I suppose someone had to win. I disagree this issue. All of the Parties including the Liberal Democratic Party are classified in losers, nutcases and non- entities and all of them don't think about Japan. I think The Liberal Democratic Party is the Party which is not wanted to win but have to win."
NBE01176,"I strongly believe that TPP is not good for Japan never been. And also His victory is not always good for Japan because he supported TPP and Iraq war, it will be suffer Japan's economy. I have a hope to Obama's activity but we have also skeptics."
NBE01226,"This election was a first time for me to vote and it was really confusing for me to vote because there weren't a person who I strongly felt that I want to vote. I hope that Abe can do something that will make Japan a better place but Im not really positive about that because his work as a president before was not really good. I hope that Japanese government settle down once to think what should be really done to Japan, not changing prime minister so many times."
NBE01978,"I do not agree with ID12059's opinion that he does not think it is suitable for someone who has been president in the past to become president again. Of course it is a serious problem that Mr. Abe resigned from president because he had a disease. However, according to William Saroyan, a man of ability can learn a lot from failures. This statement apply to Mr. Yoshida. After he resigned from president, he had been president again. Eventually, he took Japanese independence back. He learned a lot from failures. This example will apply to Mr. Abe. I believe that he will do good job. I hope Japanese people believe that too."
NBE02288,"I sympathize with your opinion. But in order to raise a voter turnout, not only a young man's consciousness reform but statesmen need to set forth a young-men-oriented policy. So I think that a statesman's change of generation is also required."
NBE02083,"Now that the political power has changed and many people expects that Japan will recover from the shock of 3.11. They also expects Japan will regain the rank of an economic power. Nowadays we often hear about what you call ""abenomics"". I'm a little anxious about the result of this election because I think people are losing consistency in their opinion. Think of the case of atomic energy. Most of the people want to phase out nuclear power and anti nuclear power demonstration are continuing these days. But LDP's manifesto doesn't refer much to the atomic problem. I do agree that economic concerns won out but this landslide is a bit abnormal. I'm worry if the lack of consistency will heighten tensions with China, and South. We must compare territorial problem with east asian peace and consider carefully . Parties are not our mother. We shouldn't depend everything on parties, nation, and our prime minister. We should think and decide on our own."
NBE02378,"Having read many comments, I felt that many people focused on expressing their opinions about the result of the general election itself. Some of them have said that they were shocked by the fact that Mr. Abe became to be a president again. A few have explained the reasons why they thought DPJ did not deserve to win. Of course, in this unstable society, it is important to evaluate political parties and what they have done in recent years. However, I would like to comment on the future which I expect Japanese society to become this time. I think that Mr. Abe should formulate his policies realistically. In the manifest of LDP, there are many drastic policies stated remarkably. For example, it is said that an amendment to the Constitution is required in order to consider the Self-defense Forces to be National Defense Forces. Also it says that right of collective self-defense should be functioned. However, I do not assume that these policies will actually keep us safe. It is because these actions mean that our stance on pacifism promised after WW2 will change. If this perspective is recognized all over the world, reliance on us from other countries may be lost. Before we consider these problems, I think LDP should solve other innumerable problems. It might be important that LDP should rebuild national finance as soon as possible. I would like Mr. Abe to proceed with the unity reform of social security and tax and Abenomics at the same time."
NBE01255,I think that it is the most important thing for Abe to show the Japanese nation their resolution. The Prime Minister has changed many times since about 10 years ago. So Japanese nation think that new the Prime Minister will resign in about a year as well as the former The Prime minister. So Mr. Abe must show us their determination and he has to continue the Abe Administration to be realized his promise.
NBE01470,"Abe lost election six years ago. I think that is because he can't show clearly the plan he would do. But this time, he can show concrete course to rebuild Japanese economy and be trusted."
NBE01338,"Recently, the relationship between Japan and China is getting worse. Moreover, Japanese economy falls into deflation. Japan is under crisis now. I expect a lot from Abe in terms of improving Japanese recession."
NBE05583,I do not necessarily support Liberal Democratic Party but I strongly support Abe because he wants to revise the Constitution of Japan. Today China threatens the neighboring countries such as Japan and the Philippines with the naval force. Therefore Japan should reinforce the self-defense capacity.
NBE06926,"I am in favor of your opinion. I think Abe's LDP would manage economic policy more successfully and resolve diplomacy problem, too. Moreover, Abenomics will resolve economics and a lot of problems."
NBE05195,"I thought that it was impossible for Abe to be reelected , but he made success. This is the result that Japanese people believe in him. Abe has the policy that he would change the Japanese constitution. It is my concerning of this result. I don't want to be in dangerous fields."
NBE01563,"Reading this article made me really ashamed because I didn't tried to learn how people damaged by the earthquake in Iran and Pakistan after hearing the news. Also I didn't even pay attention to the car bomb in Iraq. Of course the terrorist attack in Boston was a serious incident and it was natural that media all over the world focused on it. However, the value of people's lives must be equal regardless of economic influence of their countries. We should remember that the press do not necessarily report all the news equally, and should attempt to learn what happen in the world by ourselves."
NBE02181,"I was shocked by this news. I think , actually, there're gap in news. Relatively, Europe and US news are picked up largely. That's because, I think, US and European country such as France, Britain have authority all over the world."
NBE01469,"I have received unquestioningly the news given. Therefore, this article get me thinking. If the value of life was estimated unequal, that may be problem. But, I also think that it is natural the mass media take priority to report their own country and related country."
NBE01717,I got a feeling of wrongness. Of course these explosions are so terrible. And such incidents related to terrorisms must be perished from the world. But there are other important information we should know. Our knowledge are controlled by such mass medias easily. So the mass medias should spread the world's journalism to make our knowledge wider.
NBE01337,"I didn't know the bomb accident in Iraq so far. I'm sure it is caused by the media. We always receive a lot of informations all over the world through the media. It is natural that the media tends to pick up the article which has great impact. But we should try to know more aggressive. To accomplish it, quit depending on the media."
NBE01360,"I don't think that world's media which failed to report a case of Iran and Pakistan consider American lives to be more important than that of the people who live in developing countries. The reason is that the people who report news as business have to announce the matter which citizens are interested in. The cause is attitude of recipients of news. With this article, I realize own narrow field of vision, so I want to have a wide one. And then, I hope to end the vicious cycle : our indifference bring upon a gap in news coverage and we don't have much interests in developing countries because journalists don't inform about them."
NBE01879,"In fact, I've never seen the news of Iraq, Iran and Pakistan, so this article convinced me so much. This""discrimination""by media I very often think about. Its sure that since the terroristic incidents in the developed countries like USA, UK, Japan and so far are very rare and these in developing countries are very common, the shock of the former is much stronger. But the life is equal. The death of all people on this planet must be treated equally. ""another less comfortable explanation is that for much of the world's media, American lives are worth more than the lives of people living in the developing world. "", this part of the article made me burn with anger. We must confront TV and newspaper with the feeling that the one death by homicide in Japan and one death by terrorism in Iraq are altogether the same loss."
NBE01781,"When I heard news of Boston, I was very surprised. I could not believe that heavy damage was given by bomb terrorism in America. However, I never surprised when I read this article and knew bomb terrorism in Iraq. Just thought ""a similar trouble happened in Iraq again"". I was very shocked such my way of thinking. Because maybe many people think in the same way, I think it is not to be helped that world media focuses attention on Boston. I hope to decrease trouble in Middle East, and want to be a person who understand that the value of the life is equal."
NBE01741,"I also felt quite strange because the media didn't report much about other sad events of the world. But since the people who work for the press have to earn living, I think it is so reasonable that they choose the news which attracts the interests of people more and cannot perfectly report based on moral perspectives. And whatever we said to them, they would never change their way of reporting. I think it important for us, who enjoy the media, to be conscious of inequality of the media, to pay attention voluntarily to the news which are not picked up especially, and to find them not less important."
NBE01519,I think that mass media treated American people and developing countries people unequally. I am actually likely to forget the blasting terror attack of Iraq and the earthquake of Iran and Pakistan in response to the influence of mass media. Also the earthquake of Sichuan was reported smaller than Boston news. I would like to have the media literacy and my opinion about the news.
NBE01610,I was shocked by this article. Why the mass media reported the Iraqi terrorism smaller than the American? Maybe people think that the Iraqi terrorism on 15/4 is less surprising than the American. So mass media reported American bigger depending on the interest of the viewer. The biased view is not mass media's but is our's. I should be more interested in the accident of the world without biased view.
NBE02785,"It is very interesting that we can see people's sense of values from headlines. I was surprised how uniform the choices by the media around the world are. Frankly speaking, I felt the explosions in Boston is more remarkable incident for me than car bombs in Iraq or the earthquake in Iran and Pakistan. But it is true that the latter incidents are also matters which we should know because they are very sad events. We must keep in mind that news don't tell us all the incidents around the world and have will to find as many remarkable matters as possible by ourselves."
NBE02680,"I was shocked by hearing the news. Because there are no tragedies like terrorism in Japan. But I think this is broadcast exaggeratedly. If this kind of matter happened in Africa , few reports were broadcast. From this news , I think the importance of life varies with the region."
NBE02312,"The mass media have a powerful influence on private citizens, so unless they stop the gaps in news we can never achieve a harmonious and multicultural society. Also We should try to know voluntarily what is happening now all over the world. Only accepting something provided is dangerous for us and the future society ."
NBE02550,"When I heard this terrible news, It reminded of me the terrorism of 9.11 in USA. The explosion took the lives of general public so I hope the terrible trouble such this is never happened. And I want the news organizations to report the world news not only the famed cities but also small cities."
NBE01538,"Although I think this accident is so important that media should cover this closely, this column implies that the media do not play the original part. The media should inform people of a news which happens all over the world equally. I think the management of the press is the main cause of this case, so we should reconsider about the interests of people who work for media."
NBE02733,"When I heard the news, I couldn't believe my eyes. The scene was awful. Actually, the explosions caused a great deal of damage. Three people were killed and around 183 people were injured. It was the sad news. I was also surprised when I knew who the terrorists were. They were about as old as I was. I don't know what made them to do the act of terrorism, but only I can say is that innocent people died, even a boy of eight. I wonder if there is any other way to change the world. In addition, I got another impression when I read this news item. To tell the truth, I didn't know much about car bombs in Iraq and the earthquake striking Iran and Pakistan. One of the reason is that some media organizations failed to mention them at all. To know about the world equally, I think we need to get information carefully."
NBE02261,"I agree the last explanation, which is that much of the world's media lay more emphasis on American lives than on the lives of people living in the developing world. Humans are a dime a dozen. Even if someone thinks me as his only girl, my life is worthless at the same time for an utter stranger to me. In that theory, the more I influence the worthier my life becomes. America is the most influential and the richest country in the world. So, it's natural that American news has priority over all other country's news."
NBE01979,"I was really surprised at this explosions. Because I live in Hiyoshi alone, I do not have TVs. I though that this world continued to be peace until I heard it at that class. I am more interested in one thing. It is that ""World media focuses attention on Boston after marathon explosions"". Of course Many people thought that the explosions in Boston were the first successful terrorist attack in the USA since 9-11, which made it a significant event. However, I think ""American lives are worth more than the lives of people living in the developing world"". I have good reasons to think so. For example, USA have the most powerful economic power and fighting power in the world. If one country was less interested in this thing, it would be hated by USA. USA is also controlling world medias. USA is the biggest state in the world!"
NBE02473,"I heard this news, I thought who caused this incident. South Korean, American, or Islamic extremist. This incident's perpetrators were American. One of the criminal said that I have no friends of American. Recently, I've been heard coverage of they were Islamic extremists. I don't know why they caused incident. Reason is not simple. But if they had also one American friend, this incident may not have happened."
NBE02007,"I've heard about the news in Boston because it was broadcast by Japanese media constantly. But I had not heard about the news in Iraq, Iran nor Pakistan. I think mass-media should report news equally to people all around the world."
NBE02056,"When I heard this news, I thought we can't predict when we face incident and who cause terror. In this case, criminals are ordinary young boys, bombs are made by pressure cookers, there are everywhere in the US How should we notice they are terrorist? How should we notice those are bombs? Probably citizens of Boston will become nervous, but I think they have to be friendly. Because, socially-isolated people will be terrorist."
NBE02289,"When I read the article, I could not understand that media considered that American lives are worth more than the lives of people living in the developing world. And I think that the media should deal with the news of not only the United States but every country in the world. The media should especially determine the weight of a life by neither a race nor nationality."
NBE02758,"I was so disappointed to read this article, because of the difference in media's treating between American lives and the lives in developing country. I think that the most important thing is not the place happened event, but contents of event. Therefore, the media should pay attention to what kind of event."
NBE02628,"When I read this article, I felt so sad. This news reminded me of 9.11. I cannot understand why people kill someone. Terrorism kill innocent people. This terrorism is the first time in 12 years. I thought no more terrorism would happen in America but it happened. We should think about terrorism again because it can happen anytime in America, also in Japan."
NBE02379,"I think it is natural that world media focuses attention more on marathon explosions in Boston, the USA, than on catastrophes happened in other countries. Since around WW1, the US have been the most powerful country economically and militarily in the world, so it is no surprise that American news is regarded as very important. In my opinion, it is not the problem of different degree on worthiness in lives between nationalities. Americans and non-Americans, especially people in the developing countries should be the same in that respect. The Charter of the United Nations insists that we all have fundamental human rights naturally. However, when it comes to the big news like explosions by terrorists, the one in the US may be the most noticeable. It is because it is unusual that big strong country is attacked by someone. People would find it interesting or devastating seeing that kind of incident. Particularly in Japan, the relationship with the US is so strong that the media may run constant updates of Boston and not much of any other news. It is sad for me not to be able to see other countries' catastrophes and I'm sorry for them, but it is the reality."
NBE01445,I was shocked to hear this news. This terrorism is so terrible. I am terrified. But there are not only this terrorism but also other terrorism in the world. I think the problem is not the place where the terrorism happened. The most important thing is every terrorism are known by many people in the world. I want many media organizations report news in the world equally. I think every lives are worth equally.
NBE02355,"When I heard this news, I thought two things. First of all, it was very regrettable that the sports event should be fun was a target of aiming indiscriminately citizens and tourists. However, I think we should review what coverage should be in future. Because focused on just this incident on the other hand, car bombs in Iraq and many casualties by an earthquake in Iran and Pakistan did not become major news. Certainly, this incident may be the case should be preferred, but tragedies happen all over the world. Second, not only we feel sad, but we should use lessons learned in order not to happen like this incident in Japan. In Japan, the sports event""Tokyo Marathon""like ""Boston Marathon"" is held every year. So I want so as not to inflict deep wound in the hearts of many people, we also Japanese review the security measures and share the information to be able to react to an emergency. At the time, I think not only authorities and guards, but we citizens should have the consciousness to cooperate is essential."
NBE01927,"I was shocked by this news. But a lot of such cases happen in the world. I felt that Japan was very peaceful. However, it does not the reason why it does not need to know the world miserable news. We have to know the world event more. I think that the Japanese media should report more world news."
NBE01667,I was very surprised at the news about two explanations in America. I am wondering why the culprit wounded an uninvolved third party. I want the culprit caught immediately. I also think there is a rift between developed countries and developing country. We should treat everybody in the world equally.
NBE02709,I was surprised and ashamed of myself when I read the news and I found that many other sad events had happened in the world. I was also the one who paid much attention to the news of Boston bombing. I often hear there are no more safer countries than Japan around the world. But I think many developed countries are safe contrary to many developing countries. I suspect that many people also regard developed country as safe area. That is why I guess the accident in Boston shocked many people around the world. I think the preconception brought about the gap in news coverage.
NBE02211,"The gap in news coverage is what I have been concerned about since around 10 Japanese people were killed in Algeria about 6 months ago, if I remember right. Japanese media paid great attention for that sad events and the media made too private reports too, such as how the casualties were adored be the people around them, how the trauma of the incident survived people have was going to be cured and videos of the friends of the casualties crying. On the other hand, the media made no reports of the reason why the peace is disturbed in Africa including Algeria nor the civil war taken place just 20 years ago that made more than 150, 000 casualties. One reason why there is such a gap is that those events happen almost everyday in the Middle East and Africa so the media simply cannot follow them, but I think pretty much every person in ""developed countries"" do not consider lives in ""developing countries"" the same as theirs. I am not sure if I can say it is wrong, but I personally dislike the trend."
NBE02525,"When I heard this news for the first time, I was surprised very much. And I thought that it was terrible if a similar case happened in Japan. We think unconsciously that such a case which happens at the place such as Iraq should not happens at the place where we live. I think this is the reason of the gap in news coverage."
NBE01830,I got to know terrorism's occurrence and was very much surprised. I was not able to understand an offender. Why did the offender wake up terrorism? We must not waste people's lives. I was very sad for my having read this report to the last. That is because the media in the world have not made people's worth equal. It became impossible for a while for me to trust media.
NBE02109,"I didn't know the sad incidents that happened all over the world except two explosions in Boston Marathon. To attract people's attention, the news media report the major news a little bit exaggeratedly. We should do not only to receive the information, but also to select and think of the information."
NBE01953,"This news made me so sad when I see the news on TV. A spectacle which two bombs exploded together surprised me very much because it was so cruel. this article say that world media focused on this news excessively. I think too. There is reasons of this insistence. First, this tragedy happened in USA U. S. A is most major country. When terrorism is successful, it's influence is biggest in the world. So this news interest more people than other news which happened in The Middle East. I think media's reaction is natural. But I want medias to report various news. I want medias not to let people say ""American lives are worth more than the lives of people living in the developing world. """
NBE02084,"I was shocked at two things about the news. One is, of course, that many people were injured and several people were killed. The other thing that shocked me was the reaction against the news. Many newspapers failed to mention about the misfortune in the middle east and many people didn't know the news. I'm also one of them. I felt really ashamed and thought that we must always consider a problem from different angles. American people's reaction also shocked me. After the terrorist was arrested people gathered and keep on shouted ""USA"" for a long time. They ""looked"" really happy and cheerful. We often this scene in USA. But, you know, this event is a tragedy. Terrorism has occurred and many people were injured, also killed. We shouldn't behave cheerful. Also we should think the background of this terrorism, not just behaving thoughtlessly on a given occasion. Why did young ordinary man did such a thing?Because he was from Chechen?Because he was a muslim(I don't think so)?There is always a reason behind such event. As long as people all over the world won't think carefully, and behave like part of American people we can't fight against terrorism in true sense."
NBE02135,"I think this case is very difficult problem. Because, it contains two different problems. First problem is terrorism. As we know, terrorism is atrocity action. But, culprits may have something on their mind. After due consideration, we should take measures. Second problem is weight of life. I think weight of life is different depending on the person. For example, I think a useful man for everyone is heavy and culprit is light. But, it is not by nation, sex. This is just my idea. But, we should think many things from this case."
NBE01635,"I became so sorry to hear this sad news. Many people are killed in the world every day, specially in developing countries. However, most of us ignore them. The explosion was occurred in America, the most powerful country all over the world, so the media broadcast this incident, I think. We have learn many things from this explosion."
NBE02653,"I felt very sad to hear the terrifying news. Boston Marathon is one of the biggest sports events in the world, and so many people join it from all over the world. It is important and happy for us to connect with foreign people throughout sports if normally held. Therefore, I never forgive the culprits even if they have any reasons to commit a crime. However, there is a more serious problem behind this explosions. We all know the Boston bombing but do not know other terrible affairs happened at the same period of time. This is because world media organizations failed to mention them at all. After all, we general public are not given the chance to know them. Although some say there is priority in news coverage, I cannot agree with that because each affair always becomes the most significant to the relatives of victims. So, in my opinion, they should not completely ignore small scale matters around the world."
NBE02498,"I was very sad to hear the news that many people was injured by this terrorism indiscriminately. To begin with, I became aware of this incident by watching TV, but I didn't know what other sad events happened in the developing countries. The U. S. A was so powerful developed country that the most mass media would report this incident. So I think the mass media is biased. However, I think that the mass media response is natural. The mass media usually have to select informations according to priority. So such a gap in news coverage always happen, in my opinion. Therefore, we must not only receive the information passively, but also get other information actively."
NBE01691,"I think it's not about our respect for each life but about our interest. America is very influential over other countries because of business, politics and so on, and their culture such as their music and movies are popular to people all over the world. Above all, such a terrible terror hadn't happened in America since 9-11. On the other hand, Iraq, Iran and Pakistan are less influential for us. Furthermore, Iraq isn't a safe country originally, and earthquake is natural phenomenon. Therefore, the affair in America collects our interest more, and has more impact into us, so it's natural for media to put emphasis on that news. However, the news in those developing countries had to be known to people in the world. Then I think that media would show those news if we really cared about them. media is mirrors of what we think, so we have to consider about ourselves this time."
NBE02235,"I did not know that the same day as this bombing had the automobile bombing in Iraq, either. However, more the incident of Iraq persons than a US incident have passed away. We think that we need to consider this fact more earnestly. Even if the country is rich, the weight of a life should not become heavy, and the weight of a life should not become light even if poor. I hope people in the world recognize this problem in this incident."
NBE02578,"I was surprised at the explosions because after 9.11 America has clearly improved the ability of guarding. And in my opinion, the width of the gap in news coverage depends on the number of affected people. Speaking of this case, the incident of America, the center of economy and the leader of developed countries, affects more people than one of a developing country does. But this isn't justice. We should cover various news around the world in point of ethical view."
NBE02604,"When I first heard about this news, I was shocked at this miserable incident. Especially, it was sad that the child aged only eight was killed in the explosion. This event may have reminded American people of the fear that they felt on 3.11. Almost all of the media organizations around the world reported this news soon after the explosion. But, they did not report some incidents that happened on the very same day; for example, car bombs at market places in Iraq, which killed over 30 people. In my opinion, the reason why there is such a gap in news coverage is the powers of countries. In this case, US has a great influence on the world because US has a great economic and military power. In contrast, Iraq does not have much influence. However, I think media organizations in the world should report world events that have dead persons as much as possible. This is because we should value all human's life regardless of his or her nationality."
NBE02332,"This news made my interest in world media. This is because I knew the news about marathon explosions in Boston, but I didn't know about earthquake in Iran and Pakistan and car bomb in Iraq. From this article I learned we only know the news which media was take up, so our knowledge about world news is only a little part. I feel ashamed about this, and I thought we need to be more greedy about world news."
NBE01230,"I think it is safe all over the world, because I can't feel the danger in Japan. But this news made me remember, and so scary. People always fight terrorism, war, and so on. I am blessed, so I should feel the world more to go abroad. Terrorism at Boston Marathon made the citizen scary, because 9.11 happened at the building of the high position, but this time happened at the very near position. People felt the danger of the terrorism, so hard. I think terrorism should fade out, so people should think more about the terrorism!!!"
NBE01280,"There was no way these media was to blame. In fact the US is the world's economically biggest country. If such bombing accident should occur around the Wall Street, it will absolutely affect world's stock price, and a financial panic may occur. Also, since 9/11 happened, the US has been trying to acts of terrorism. Thanks to this, some attempts are revealed in advance. However, this bombing accident in Boston did occur. Seen from this aspect, I think these media treated this accident properly."
NBE02428,"USA is very influential all over the world and the connections among the countries is strong. Furthermore terrorism has big impact to us. So, I think it was natural that media took it seriously. In addition, not only the case of sad news but in the case of ordinary news, there are the gap in the news coverage. Therefore, I declare the phenomenon was not caused by the gap of worthiness of our lives but the difference of our concern. And, I heard the incredible story that the explosion may have been fabrication, in spite of it was attracted so much attention around the world . When I knew that , I don't know whether it is true or not, I think we should not depend on limited information sources, and accept it without question."
NBE01309,"In my opinion, mainly, news broadcast on media is an emergency. For example, the explosion in Boston marathon is exactly an unusual incident. But it doesn't mean that other incidents aren't important. Ideally, all things happened in the world should be broadcast on media. In fact, many factors - time, information and attention by people- interrupt broadcasting. In this condition, we need actively pay attention to affairs which aren't broadcast on media. This may make us familiar with much international information."
NBE01493,"After I read this article, I was angry at the idea of racial discrimination. However if I think about it, I have such a idea in some small measure . Of course I don't think that American (Japanese) lives are worth more than the lives of the people in the developing world, but I think Japanese and American and the like people are excel at bottom. So, I think the problem of racial discrimination are not easy problem. But, I wish the world really without racial discrimination, and we must make an effort to exclude racial discrimination."
NBE01256,I think this is very important problem. America is one of the largest country. And many people are interested in matter of America. So media report news of America more than news of the developing world. But I think that not all the people think the news of America is more important than the news of the developing world. So media should report not only large country's news but also the developing country's news. I think that media must understand that the lives of people living in the developing world as important as American lives .
NBE01903,"I think this media response shows the USA is the most powerful country in the world. If two explosions hadn't happened, other news would take attention. It is because those news are big news, too. However, because of the impact which the US has, they were not in the spotlight. That's the way it goes. However, that doesn't mean that you should ignore those news. I think you must notice those news even if they are not in the spotlight."
NBE02033,"I think it is complex to arise the gap. and the world media overlooked the possibility of developing country. There are the gap between developing countries and developed nations about news, too. As we know, the U. S is one of the most effective countries in the world. and this is the nation which incurred tragic terrorism. so I think there are compound reasons to occur the gap of broad cast. Moreover, the developing countries have the possibility to lead the world. That is why I think the media have to attention these countries, too."
NBE02681,"I think the importance of life should not be different depending on region. But in fact, media intend to broadcast mainly about developed countries, for instance the U. S, the U. K, Germany, France and so on. On the other hand, developing countries in Africa, Middle-east, Asia are rarely broadcast. If accident like 9.11 happens in Africa, this accident may not spread worldwide. I think this wrong, but in reality, this may be true."
NBE01806,"Actually, I saw news of accidents in America than Iraq and Pakistan on TV. Of course, we must understand that American lives are worth as well as the lives of people living in the developing world. There is no difference between them. On the other hand, I think many people are interested in American news more than the developing country because of the power of nation. Japan has strong relationship with U. N. , so American news have possibility of having an effect on Japan. This reason applies other countries. As a result, World media focuses attention on U. N. after developing countries."
NBE02160,"I was surprised at this news, and I was also don't know about car bombs at market places in Iraq, there were many casualties after an earthquake struck Iran and Pakistan. It cannot exist a discrimination. Lives of each people are equal."
NBE02742,"I agree with ID13020's opinion. We are controlled easily by the mass medias. In this case, some medias reported about the explosion in Boston too much instead of reporting about car bombs in Iraq or the earthquake striking Iran and Pakistan. Actually, I knew about the explosion but didn't know the details of others. So, as ID13020 said, to make our knowledge wider the mass medias should spread the world's journalism ."
NBE02065,"I agree your opinion. I think the medias have to report any incident even if terrorism was happened in small country. Of course, it is the best that there is no incident to report."
NBE01373,"I agree to the idea that people who enjoy the news should pay attention to the news in a variety of the world. I think if we have an interest in various news, the media will meet the expectations and, cover a story about the case of each country distinction, and I believe knowing the news diverse in that way is a chance to live better and broaden our field of view."
NBE01700,"I agree with you. I think media have duty to tell public wider information, but we also have faults now. media didn't publish about them just because we usually don't pay attention to them much, so we should change ourselves at first."
NBE01399,"This problem is very important. Developing countries sometime be attracted not much attention. Why? Because I think that people take notice about major countries, and developed countries have information technology better than developing countries. We have to look at the world with a broad view."
NBE01589,"I think media's great attention to this news is natural. Because the United States has been fighting with terrorist since 9/11 had occurred. After that terrible incident, not only American but also world people becomes sensitive about terrorism in America. It is true that other news are important, but this news is much more important than others."
NBE01590,I agree with your opinion. Unconciously we tend to lay stress on western country's affair and ignore middle eastern or African country's affair. But now we live in global age. We have to have wide range of view.
NBE01264,I have different opinion from umaumashiii. I think mass-media should report the most important news many times. I think other news also should be reported. But I think important news should be reported more than other news.
NBE02588,"I disagree with you because mass media need to report the news that affects more people preferentially. I think it is impossible for mass media to do equally. However, I want to say too that it shouldn't ignore the news that they think affects fewer people."
NBE01400,"I don't agree with you. Of course, terrorism maybe happen in Japan. But the most important point of this news is GAP I think. If we understand about contemporary condition of all over the world clearly, we can be more kind to other country, other people. So we have to require continual awareness of world before concern about terrorism."
NBE01645,"I agree with her. We seldom pay attention to the developing countries. Newspapers do not report such incidents in the developing countries. As she says, we have to look at the world with a broad view."
NBE02414,I think mass-media should report the most important news many times. I think other news also should be reported. But I think important news should be reported more than other news. I think mass media need to report the news that affects more people preferentially. They should not make any difference between countries.
NBE01423,I think this media reaction is strange because making too much attention to Boston marathon's incident and not making so much attention to incidents which occurred around the world is wrong thing. So I think this media reaction is not correct.
NBE01860,I was shocked to hear the news. I think this happening is like a 9.11. It is very horrible. I wonder why some people do such a horrible act. I think these media say wrong and different things. It is cruel for many victims
NBE01629,"I agree with ID13020's opinion. Mass media should broadcast wider information. The wider the mass media broadcast , the thinner become the contents of the news, but we don't have to get all the information from the mass media. We should chose the topic from the mass media's broadcast and if we want more information, we can search for the Internet."
NBE01775,"I was surprised by this article. Of course these explosions are so terrible. And such incidents related to terrorisms should be published all over the world. But I think there are other important information we should know. Our knowledge are controlled by such mass medias easily. So, the mass medias should spread the journalism to make our knowledge wider."
NBE02869,"As long as the value of our lives is equal, the amount of news about someone's death which is broadcast shouldn't be unequal depending on the nationality. I can understand that explosions at the Boston marathon have a big meaning not only for the U. S but also for us. However, it is very important for those who live in developed countries , including us, to be interested in events in developing countries because we tend to think those events are indifferent to us. Therefore , media have to consciously focus on news in developing countries for us to be interested in those news."
NBE02870,"According to this news, I thought the way of coverage again. Nowadays, we can easily know various news around the world. For example, we can get information not only by newspaper but also Internet . Therefore, I think the value of coverage is becoming more and more important because news are more likely to influence on our daily lives. However, this article says there is a gap in news coverage. I think this is very terrible thing, and made me sad. Moreover, I thought we should try to change such idea. I don't think American lives are worth more than the lives of people living in developing world. In fact, I believe learning about the way of living which is different from ours can broaden our outlooks. I really want news reporters to have responsibilities toward their article, and at the same time , it is very important for young people nowadays that they should learn how to judge news at school."
NBE02872,"When i heard this news, i was shocked very much. i think that an average citizen without a crime is not allowed to fall victim. however , from a criminal's viewpoint , they seemed to worry about religion or a racial problem . so It seems that this incident has the deep back. I think it important to see things from various viewpoints."
NBE02871,"He can understand that a person's mind in history is never objective perfectly. And, he say ""I think media , such as newspaper, TV, magazines, have to tell people things correctly and try to do their best. "" He points out danger of the slant report. His point of view is wonderful."
NBE07273,"Recently we usually get news passively through the tv and internet. To know important news , we should change ourselves and get news actively. When I heard this news, first I think the security system should be improved. But if the surveillance camera increases, we should keep in mind human action will be restricted. To protect human right , we should shift the situation gradually an carefully."
NBE06573,"Journalists tend to write a topic which people are interested in . Therefore, it may be natural that journalists write a news about developed countries than developing countries. But people must be equal. Regardless of countries, news have to be fairly reported. From now on I will be more careful about news"
NBE06895,"I think that it is not good that the frequency of using news is graduated according only the concern of people and the profit. Certainly, the best purpose of news medias is that they interest a lot of people in news and profit from a TV reception fee or a sale of newspapers. America is one of the most influential countries and an act of terrorism in the USA surprise people all over the world absolutely. But our lives are all equal and it is not difference between American people and developing country's people. So I think that it is important to report news without the position and popularity in the world as equal as possible. And we should turn our eyes to the news of not only developed countries but also developing countries."
NBE06873,"I remember this case very well. It was shocking to be killed innocent people. I was very surprised at media. When I was a high school student, I was a member of newspaper club. Our club was very strong and I was able to experience many interviews and writing article, so in my opinion, media should report the truth even if the situation is bad for them. It is true that they have the freedom of expression, but they should not pursue their own interests as long as they have readers."
NBE05489,"This is how Mass media have an affect people. Their impact is very huge. In other word, what media don't pick up seems to be not the problems. Media can control the news. Media sometimes broadcast the wrong information. We should have ability to judge information ourselves."
NBE02474,"I was surprised at reading this article. Because, gun was made by printer. This means that anyone will be able to make gun in near future. I think to own weapon for self defense is wrong. We have to reduce weapon in the world. So, we need ruleS of plastic gun. I hope that 3D printer useful for development of the world."
NBE01636,"I think it is very dangerous to distribute the blueprints for the gun online. Getting the blueprints online means that lay public can make guns for themselves. Of course, gun is a dangerous substance, and there is a possibility to cause a horrible accident. I consider that 3D plastic printer is convenient, however, I think we have to think about how to use it over and over."
NBE01540,"I thought this is a awful news. The reason is that a 3D plastic printer is available to everyone, so making guns will be very easy thing. If this happens, people in countries which ban gun use can get guns illegally. Illegal possession of guns surely results to confusion of society. Thus the world authorities should discuss carefully the regulation of these guns before they are completely available online. I think regulations through the Internet is effective measure for example."
NBE01980,"This news gave me a great impact. That is because guns can be produced by 3D printer. I think this new development will give us bad luck in the future. This reason to think so is that gun will be more easy to make and more popular than ever before. More people have guns than ever before. Murders happen because there are guns in our life. If you want to reduce the number of murders, you have to reduce the number of guns. However, the new development will increase the number of guns. In short, the news will produce bad luck, no good luck."
NBE02734,"When i read this article, I was surprised. To tell the truth, I didn't even know much about the 3D printer. Of course, 3D printer is an epoch-making invention because it makes it possible to copy all kinds of things. However, according to the article, I also think that it causes serious trouble if you used it in the wrong way. If anyone can make his own gun easily, it will bring chaos. There is no need to get a gun easily. I hope the US government will make a new strict regulation about this situation early."
NBE02290,"I was surprised that guns can be produced by 3D printer. I think that new invention may inflict damage on us in the future. If guns can manufacture easily, people can get them easily rather than before. However, if the government does not enact law, people may abuse them. So I think that the government should tighten up regulation."
NBE02291,So I think that the government should tighten up regulation.
NBE02110,"I think the plastic guns are very dangerous. That cannot be detected by walk-through metal detectors, and that can kill people. People with the plastic gun can take a plane without being by the metal detector. I watched a news that a child who was given a gun by his parents killed his sister. After all, we shouldn't have not only plastic guns, but also usual guns."
NBE01414,"When I first know about the 3D printer, I was really amazed at its function . The invention of 3D printer is a great achievement, but I have a concern about the outcome of it. The 3D printer can produce guns. It means in the future everyone will be able to produce guns easily. This situation is really dangerous. So there should be some kind of regulations when we use the 3D printers."
NBE02262,"I cannot see the handgun directly. Because I see the handgun via comic books and televisions, my image of it is the weapon just to kill people. After I read this article, I hit upon a question, ""Is there a need to improve the handgun?"" If the handgun develops, such the plastic handgun which is undetectable like this article or further miniaturization, the number of people killed will increase. I think that it's wasteful and miserable to use human intelligence not on something to save people like medical science but on something to make people grieve like an atomic bomb. Developments of new products need much time and money. We had better invest our exertions into public happiness or utensils which make the society more convenient instead of something which is doubtful whether legal or illegal."
NBE02759,"I have not known about 3D printer until I read this article and was very surprised at the function of 3D printer such as making the plastic handgun. I think that invention of 3D printer in itself is so amazing, but spread of 3D printer is dangerous, because everyone can get weapon such as plastic handgun. Therefore, I suggest that government of each nation should regulate using 3D printer to keep safety in future."
NBE02356,"First of all, I was surprised at this news by knowing that I thought that it would be in the future and have already realized. But I felt awful simultaneously. The blueprints of the gun can download online that written in this article, it seems that peoples who downloaded it are more than 60, 000 peoples in Japan. That is, it can be said that is theoretically possible for peoples in Japan able to print the gun from data. And if 3D-printed gun were to spread widely, anyone would be able to make gun, and no customer buying history and no criminal record of the gun couldn't help spreading. In this way, there are many risk when 3D printers spread to home, but also said that may cause a revolution in relation to design and manufacturing. If we can get design like the gun, we may be able to print things at home without bothering to go shopping. When it becomes so, our lives probably will become convenient more than expected."
NBE02380,"When I read this article, I was simply impressed by the advance in technology. Not long ago, we could not print something in various colors but only in black and white. Now we can compose guns by 3D printers! How cool is that? Of course it is not appropriate for ordinary people to make guns. However, I think plastic guns should be allowed by laying down some rules. The reason is that the advance in technology is a result of improvement in human intelligence, and we should approve and admire that. To consider plastic guns as a symbol of the human intelligence, we had better think of the way they can be used peacefully. First, the government should ban putting blueprints of guns online so that ordinary people cannot easily make them. Second, police authorities should arrest people who are having guns with no permission as soon as they found them. For now, I can only think of these rules, but I am sure there are many other rules to be set."
NBE01668,"Guns are only instrument that injure person, this is my opinion. I think that we should not produce guns because this behavior falls far short of a peaceful world and using these weapons is gangsterism. But it is also a fact that it has been taking a long time and a great effort for producing guns, and it curb a useless war. I accept this fact and think of gun this after time."
NBE01743,"Many people say that the guns made from plastic are really dangerous because they cannot be noticed with metal detectors. These guns would make terrorisms and crimes easier to be performed, but probably we can't create the perfect regulations to prevent them from being spread across the world. People developed technology so highly and rapidly that our moral standards don't keep up with it. I'm afraid that someday we'll be killed, or now we might be being killed, by our own technology, which has been out of our hands."
NBE02057,"Why Cody Wilson developed 3D-printed handgun?To self-defense of civilian?Just a curiosity?I think he should not have to developed and to published blueprint on the web all the more, because in the U. S, the accident by gun for children become a issue. By the way, I recall the terrorism in Boston. I thought we can't notice who is a terrorist, if 3D-printed handgun will be made in standard home, it's become more difficult to find dangerous person. So I propose exploit 3D-printed bulletproof vest."
NBE01565,"This news clearly showed us that a 3D plastic printer had an enough ability to copy such a complicated product accurately. It means that 3D printers would play a very important role in the manufacture of industrial products in the near future, since they could help people who don't have special facilities make products or develop their inventions. On the other hand, I strongly disagree with the idea of publishing the blueprints for the gun online, because it will allow everyone to make guns. This makes it easier for terrorists and radical criminals around the world to get arms instead of smuggling. Cody Wilson should make use of the great skills of 3D printers in a peaceful way."
NBE02136,"I think it is a bad news because people should not use force easily. 3D-printed handgun must change our ideas about force. Perhaps, we will regard 3D-printed handgun as a toy even though we can kill a man by it. If we have a strong power, we must take on responsibility for it. But, 3D-printed handgun may make us forget the responsibility by getting easily. So, I oppose 3D-printed handgun."
NBE02629,"At first, this news sounded interesting to me because we can make anything easily by using 3D-printer . However, it means anyone can make weapons like this article. It is so dangerous. I think 3D-printer is good thing and I want to use this for fun but I never want to use this for fighting or making weapons. So we should think about this problem and make some rules to use 3D-printer for example, ""Making weapons by using 3D-printer is prohibited. """
NBE01471,"In my opinion, all guns should be banned by the low. So if this 3D-printed handgun has destructive power as equal as normal gun, this gun is also had to be regulated. But The United States does not even have sufficient ""normal"" gun control. I doubt this gun is banned in real."
NBE01446,I was surprised that guns are produced by 3D printer. I think 3D printer is the very useful instrument. A great achievement of technology such as 3D printer can produce guns. It is full of inconsistencies. I think the gun is one of the most dangerous instruments. The guns can kill people. The guns cause dangerous matters. I hope that the guns are banned in the world.
NBE01362,"I feel that I'm very terrible about this news while I admired innovation. Now, 3D plastic printer has not yet become a common sight , however, some other time, it will be spread to the general public. When it became so, on the one hand, we get convenience and originality. On the other hand, we will have the risk. The risk is very serious. It means that a terrorist brings in a gun in secret and is usable to hijack an airplane. The gun which is not discovered in a metal detector makes it easy that someone perform terrorism. For reasons of the above, I think this technique is splendid, but it must be prohibited from making a gun by using a 3D printer."
NBE01928,"When I watched this news for the first time, I was surprised very much. Why he would show a figure of setting of the gun? He has got rid of value of one invention. The new technique has turned into the weapon. I think that ""the technological change"" is synonymous with ""the evolution of the weapon"". The science does the life of people usefully, but makes danger at the same time. It is sad that the invention such as the 3D printer is applied to a weapon."
NBE02008,"I didn't know anything about 3D-printed handgun, and I am surprised to know that there is such a thing. The fact that handguns can easily be made is too dangerous. There are many shooting incidents happening in America and it will only encourage these affairs. It is necessary for people in America to think about the meaning of guns ownership."
NBE02499,"I was so surprised to watch this news that Cody Wilson innovated 3D-handgun . 3D-handgun can be made easily, cheaply, so it means handgun is more familiar to us. It is true that Cody Wilson is the great inventor, but he cannot contribute to the world and his invention may make the world worse. Especially, in the U. S. A, as it's law permit people in the U. S. A to have handgun, the invention of the 3D-handgun will let them get and use handgun more easily, and may cause a lot of shooting incidents, in my opinion. So I agree Charles Schumer's opinion that 3D-handgun should be banned. In Japan, it's law prevent people in Japan from having handgun. However, the invention of weapon, such as 3D-handgun , may invite shooting trouble in Japan. I think that we have to think about the danger of having weapon, in order to avoid the damage of weapon."
NBE02605,"I strongly criticize the 3D-printed handgun. This is because the development has very dangerous effects on all countries around the world. If the plastic gun is permitted, anyone who has a 3D printer and plan of the gun can get power to kill others. Moreover, the gun is not detectable by metal detectors, and so the police cannot determine who has the gun. As a result, not only in America, but also in all countries around the world, the number of murders will sharply rise. From these reasons, the 3D-printed handgun should be banned in the world."
NBE02551,"When I read this article, I felt very scared of the fact making handguns by 3D printer. I think we have the familiar image of the printer. Nowadays, almost families have the printers and often use them. So I am afraid that we can be easy to create handguns in the near future. though it is not illegal for people to have them in U. S, I think making them by ourselves is more dangerous than that. The government should pay attention not to make them easily and spread them illegally."
NBE01231,"I was surprised at this article, when I first read it. Because it is easy to make the gun. If we can really make it, I can't sleep deeply. Because a person may sight me. I think to make it is very dangerous, so the government should prohibit to make new gun with 3D printer. In the world, people invented the useful things, but is it OK!? People maybe surpass the line which God allow people do. We should think about the moral range!!"
NBE02710,"When I read the article, I was surprised at the technology of 3D-printed handgun and at the progress of technology. However, I felt danger at the same time. Permitting everyone to hold the gun means that everybody has the power to kill persons. This will make it easy for the people such as terrorists to get their arm strong. Once the blueprints for the gun is published online, it is difficult to delete it. So I think that we should think about it again and again."
NBE02085,"Well, I don't understand why they've made a new type of gun today. These days there are many controversy about gun regulation in the U. S because of the unstoppable occurrence of gun tragedy. President Obama has mentioned the reinforcement of the regulation. The U. S is at the turning point. Therefore the development of the plastic gun is out of the step with the times. Plastic gun may worsen the situation. Why do you have to make a new type of gun?To save your life?For what you call 'a self-defense'?Why does it has to be plastic?To pass metal detector test?It really sucks. No matter how they might think, I don't think those guns will make us happy."
NBE02654,"First of all, I was surprised at the news in two ways. One is the existence of an 3D printer and its technology that can even make handguns. The other is to have a handgun is common for people in America although the matter is now controversial. I cannot understand why Americans feel such great interest in guns. Also, I wonder if they don't get satisfaction from an air gun. I think a gun made from plastic is very dangerous because the general public will be able to own it easily. In my opinion, guns only become tools to hurt people or to bring chaos to the society, having a plastic gun should not be allowed. In conclusion, I hope legislation immediately to make a gun with a 3D printer illegal."
NBE02405,I was really surprised when I read this article. I did not even know about 3D printer until I read this news. I think it is amazing that we found many kinds of new technologies but we need to be careful how to use them. I think it is really dangerous if anyone can make their own guns easily. It will bring us chaos. I think the US' government should be more careful about guns and should make more strict rules.
NBE01281,"Surely it makes me feel anxious about plastic-made handguns, but it's difficult to restrict these guns, because, in the US , people have the right to have guns legally. In fact, Obama is having a hard time to make a gun control law. Rather, what I concern is that the Government makes the 3D printer illegal thanks to this affair. The printer itself is so hopeful that NASA has bestowed a $125, 000 grant on a research corporation to pursue the development of 3D-printable food(according to http://arstechnica. com/gadgets/2013/05/3d-printable-food-nasa-wants-a-taste/). We shouldn't see this problem in a single aspect."
NBE02182,"I think gun made by 3d printer should be banned because it is copy but it can be used as a gun. 3d printer is epoch-making but has a lot of dangerous sides. However , if we use it in a true way, we will feel it is very convenient machine."
NBE02683,"Surely, 3D printer makes the standard of living because anyone can create whatever they want to create. But, creating the matter that can be harmful for other people or unlawful like gun is probable. So creating like this must be banned, and it will be excellent if that can."
NBE02213,"I don't see why 3D-printer handgun issue is so controversial. Of course it seems to be dangerous that anybody can make handguns easily by using 3D-printer , but there are so many dangerous things, which can kill people, around us. For example you can make poison gas by mixing dish washing liquid or whatever. I think this 3D-printer issue has given us a vivid impression and that is all. I mean our daily life will not change even if 3D-printed handguns spread."
NBE02579,"It's really surprising for me that the technology of 3D printer has been available in such a way. And in my opinion, from the point of view of safety, the gun should be banned despite it includes the parts of steel."
NBE02454,This should be illegal. Because people can make weapon which can kill people very easily. More important is this gun is made by plastic. Because of this a metal detector becomes useless. So it becomes very hard to find guns.
NBE01719,"In the US, it is impossible to ban using guns because guns are too common to ban. But I think if the guns become more available, people will get less attention to human's life. So, I think spreading 3D-printed handgun may make more amount of terrible or criminal cases. Of course, guns are useful to protect owner's body from something dangerous. But they must know they all can be criminal by using it and regulate within bounds."
NBE02236,"I watched 3D printer also on television immediately after reading this report. I think it dangerous that a gun can be made also from whom if I use this printer. However, I think that 3D printer is uncanny and useful. I think that it is necessary to make law so that 3D printer cannot be abused. Then, I think that everybody can use 3D printer in comfort."
NBE01783,I already knew that there is the technique of the 3D-printer. However I was surprised to know that this technique can make a gun. Because I did not think that it could make the thing which a strong shock hung like a gun. This technology is very convenient. But it is clear to become the big problem when people can easily make a gun in this way. I think that legal regulation is ineffective. I hope that the system which people can't produce the dangerous material is made.
NBE02526,"I was surprised to hear this news very much. I think the fact that 3D plastic printers can make guns means that anyone becomes able to easily make a gun, if he or she has no knowledge about it. It is awful!! I hope that the casualties case using this gun does not happen."
NBE01611,"If the blueprints of the gun would be published online, we would be able to make guns ourselves by 3D printer. I think this easiness is terrible. The easier we can get guns , the more accident or criminal happen. 3D printer is probably convenient but we should restricted carefully what is allowed to make by the printer and what is not. Otherwise, our safety would be endangered."
NBE02161,"Guns are shouldn't made easily. We have to ban the plastic guns;otherwise we will live in a dangerous world in the future. there are many risk when 3D printers spread to home, but also said that may cause a revolution in relation to design and manufacturing."
NBE02333,"After I read this article, I was really surprised about handguns can make by 3D printer. Also I felt scare about the news. This is because near the future, if 3D printer will spread to the public, a lot of people are able to get handguns easily. In Japan, there is a law of control guns strictly, but if 3D printer guns were spread, that law will not able to work anymore. I think this situation will bring more crime. So I think we need some laws about 3D printer which control weapons strictly."
NBE01257,I was surprised when I read this news. Plastic handgun can be made by 3D printer. So everyone can get plastic handgun easily if everyone become to use 3D printer. But plastic handgun is very dangerous and it can kill someone. So I think that government should not allow to make plastic handgun by 3D printer.
NBE01904,"I think the news that the world's first gun made almost entirely by a 3D plastic printer has been successfully fired in Texas is very serious problem in the world. It is because plastic guns are cheaper than metal one. And also, you can make them easily if you have a 3D printer. So the peace might be broken by gangsters who have plastic guns. It is true that plastic guns are not as powerful as metal one because of the difference between raw materials. However, they would be powerful weapons because of technical innovation. Governments in the world should make building a gun with a 3D printer illegal."
NBE01831,"I was impressed very much, when 3D printer was made. It is because 3D printer can make various things if a plan is got. However, 3D printer will also make a dangerous thing to us. This occurrence will give us fear. We should eliminate a dangerous plan from the Internet. And we would like to use wonderful 3D printer safely."
NBE01495,"After I read this article except the last paragraph, I was surprised at the 3D plastic printer gun, and I think it will become very strong and portable weapon. But I red the last paragraph, I was angry that it became illegal. Of course The Undetectable Firearms Act is good law because any guns which cannot be found by metal detectors enable us to do an act of terrorism. So any guns which are not made of any metal is illegal. But the gun of Wilson is inserted metals, so metal detectors can find out it. In addition, 3D plastic printer gun has been successfully fired in test. So it has no problem about security. So I think it should be legal, and Undetectable Firearms Modernisation Act are illegal."
NBE01954,"I think that printed handgun shouldn't be permitted. I don't intend to criticize American Gun Culture. But I think that gun should be use by adults who use for protecting themselves and their family. If printed handgun is spread, children can get handguns easily and children who don't know meaning and usage of gun have accidents. And simply, easier americans get guns, more accidents are connected with guns happen. So I think printed handgun shouldn't be permitted."
NBE01807,"It is wonderful technology to develop 3D-printed handgun. Many people probably don't imagine this new gun. We can make gun more easily with low material cost. However, this gun also have a lot of risks. Recently, the accident related with gun happened in U. N. More and more people think the gun should be regulated strictly than now. On the other hand, many people still think we should have guns for protection of own life. So the demand of the gun is high even now. Under this condition, it is difficult that we regulate illegal gun with 3D printer completely. We should know how to live safely in gun politics."
NBE01880,"I read this article both comfortably and uneasily. Of course its very exciting that we'll be able to make 3D-printed gun far more easily and with less cost. But simultaneously this technology will be very very dangerous. A dangerous thing like this gun will be made too much easily by the normal people who buy this 3D-printer. Recently lots of incident have been led by gun in the US for example. In even Japan, this sort of incident will be likely to increase by these technology. We must be cautious for this news."
NBE01693,"It was really surprising to read this article. I got some knowledge about 3D printer at a museum in London, but I didn't know that even handgun can be made by it and 3D printer is so practical now. Of course, I agree with making 3D-printed handgun illegal. If handgun become available so easily, the number of killed people must increase much. I can't imagine the world people can acquire such a terrible one. However, I think it means that current technology are advancing highly, and we can apply in many place. For example, if we have a 3D printer at home, we can try shoes on, and it will make more common to buy something online."
NBE02034,"I think we should make the international law about 3D-printed handgun. I thought it's very interesting to make handgun by 3D printer but it is also dangerous when I read this article . Furthermore, if technology progresses, a gun without metal will be made. I think. Then, what do we do? The gun is undetectable when it is tested by metal detectors. We cannot deal with the situation. . . In addition, American president, Mr. Obama, asserts to regulate to have gun in a whole nation. So, now I think we should make the international law about the gun and we will make safe using 3D printer."
NBE01340,"Now, in America, the gun is illegal and most of people have it to protect themselves. It is no doubt the innovation will be the cause of encouraging the ""gun politics"". people would be able to get it cheaper and easier. Certainly, the technology is really amazing and surprise, but I'm afraid it would be abused by someone."
NBE02429,"I was so scared hearing the news. It is like dynamite produced by Einstein which is used for war against his view. I think technology should be used for the purpose of improving our lives and affording us happiness. I know it is said that 3D printer has many worthless points. By using it, you can reduce the cost of trial manufacture, and you can produce easily an unique, only one thing in the world, such as private memorial things and so on. It is clear that it is never anything frightening us. Therefore, I agree with making building a gun with 3D printer illegal. I think the legislations should be introduced rapidly. In addition, I think that some function of 3D printer, which make it impossible to produce every arms, should be developed. we can't completely control lawbreaker, but we can lose the root."
NBE02314,"If the 3D printer prevail among public citizens, this type of guns will be easily available to anyone. For sure, we should strengthen the current law to prevent it. Laws, however, never have a power to stop crimes perfectly: in fact, laws against murder do not necessarily prevent it. So we have to come up with new effective measures that reinforce the laws as soon as we can;otherwise the crime rate will be assumed to be even higher in the near future and the tragedies like the terrorist attack in Boston will increase."
NBE01311,"It is true that gun made by 3D printer is very useful, especially we can make it with low cost and easily. But if it is spread in the world, we cann't sleep comfortably and even go around own house. We never allow it."
NBE02743,"I agree with ID13013's opinion. The world authorities should discuss carefully the regulation about this kind of gun. As he said, it is one of the good ideas to restrict to download the blueprints. Even though it is not commonplace for people to own a 3D plastic printer yet, it will spread in the near future. If it happens, people will be able to make many kinds of things including dangerous things, and the society will be in danger. So it is important to solve this issue quickly."
NBE01502,"I red your comment and I had different ideas from you. Of course your idea isn't mistake completely, but it is too pacifism. I think wars are never gone unless human is exterminated. So weapons are needed forever. In Constitution of Japan a war is prohibition, but it means war of aggression and it doesn't include war of aggression. So we must have weapons for attack of foreign country. Japanese is Peace at any price mind set including you, but weapons will be needed someday. So the skill to make guns by 3D printer is so useful!"
NBE02768,"I agree with ID13048's opinion. I also did not know about 3D printer until I read this article. The spread of 3D printer for private citizens is so dangerous, because they can make weapons and use them easily. Therefore, I think that the government of each countries must establish new law over treatment of 3D printer and increasing consciousness of danger to 3D printer is must."
NBE01727,"I disagree with naoeID13018's opinion. Of course guns injure person. But in US, policemen uses guns to keep the country safe and some people uses guns for their hobbies, such as hunting. I think it is difficult to call them ""gangsterism"". You should think why guns became being needed before you declare guns are only instrument that injure person."
NBE01372,"I agree with your opinion. I also think it is dangerous horribly that the plastic gun readily available. I came up with it to regulate it in each countries, but it is insufficient when viewed from the standpoint of counter-terrorism. So, I feel the plan to regulate it using the international law of you is great."
NBE02719,"I partly agree with ID13062's idea. When I saw the news on TV, I knew that this technology has affirmative sides. For example, 3D printer is applied to making clothings and medical instruments. So governments of each nation should regulate the risky use of 3D printer such as making plastic handgun by it. I think it is important to make sure of the facts, understand a use of the technology and think carefully about it."
NBE02638,"I disagree with your idea. It is not wonderful technology to make 3D-printed handgun, it is dangerous idea. We hope peace world. We hope the world nobody has weapons. I think if people can make gun easily, it is not good for us at all."
NBE01573,"I agree with ID13036's idea. Not just plastic guns but usual metal guns should be prohibited. In the US, people buy guns to protect their families and property, yet guns took their precious lives. The fact that anyone can make plastic guns easily means that anyone can kill people around them easily. It must not be allowed."
NBE01398,"This news was shocking to me. Guns can make easier than before, and are made by general person like us. It is really dangerous i think. If guns are made by children or criminals, that's really serious news! Of course blue print gives us a lot of good skill, but also it is really danger. So we have to make a mature rule when we use a 3D printer."
NBE01791,"I agree with kajikosei's opinion. It is surely this technology is very comfortable, but it is more likely to be abused. However the technique is necessary to make our life better more. I want to establish the regulation method before this technique is generalized"
NBE01859,"I agree with him. If everyone can make some weapons with using 3D printer, this world is filled with weapons and cannot live safety. So I also think we should make a rule or law of 3D printer. If we can use 3D printer safety , it will be a good entertainment."
NBE02168,"i agree with you. guns only can harm people, we cannot create its too much. a nation have to make a law to ban the plastic guns and guarantee the safety of citizens."
NBE02534,"I didn't agree with Keisuke. I think the fact that 3D plastic printers can make guns means that anyone becomes able to easily make a gun, if he or she has no knowledge about it. So I want to insist 3D plastic printers have to be illegal!"
NBE01592,"When I read this article, I was amazed how sophisticated today's technology is. Today's technology becomes more and more convenient. Actually such technology improves our lives, but we should be careful the way we use it. It could be danger if we use it wrong way."
NBE01593,"I disagree with your opinion. Actually development of 3D-guns includes some risk, but it can improve technology. Today, technology is always around our lives. We can no longer live without technology."
NBE02316,I absolutely agree with you. The legal regulation like the law is not always effective. So we need to do something more fundamental about this issue.
NBE02438,"I can't agree with you. I can understand you mean that dangers in the world are not diminished, and 3D printer has a big impact but that is all. However I think it has greatly positive and negative effects on our daily lives. As we deal with every one thing seriously, the world we live can be changed ."
NBE02789,"I was not interested in a 3D printer very much, but when I read this article, I get interested in the technology. The technology has some dangerous points, but I understand its useful points. However, guns are very dangerous. I think 3D printer need some rules so that it is not used for bad things."
NBE02040,"I read your comments and [ agree with your opinion that handguns can make by 3D printer. This means anyone can have handguns near the future. . I think we have to make the rules or laws about 3D printer and use with safety. In Japan, we are more peaceful than other countries so, we have to keep or improve this condition. . . . !!"
NBE01861,"I think this machine is an epoch making invention but it will be a weapons when people use this in a different way. If everyone can make some weapons with using 3D printer, this world is filled with weapons and cannot live safety. So I also think we should make a rule or law of 3D printer. If we can use 3D printer safety , it will be a good entertainment."
NBE01774,"I think this news is awful. The reason that I think making guns will be very easy thing when a 3D plastic printer is available to everyone. if this happens, people can get guns easy. The existence of guns surely results to confusion of society. Thus the world authorities should discuss carefully the regulation of these guns."
NBE02873,"I'm really surprised to hear that news . As ID13036 said , a child who was given a gun by his parents killed his sister. This news made me think that all nations should ban people from using guns freely . However, if the company publishes the blueprints for the gun online , people all around the world, for example Japan , where people can't gain guns freely, will gain guns more freely. All nations should discuss how to use 3DS printer carefully."
NBE05996,I think your opinion is nice one. but it is difficult to remove gam from society. Because gun has not only but point. For example gun help defense by my self.
NBE06278,"3D printing is revolutionary idea. I want this technology used safety. If it is used for bad thing such as making guns, it surely harms many people."
NBE02875,"This gun is dangerous. We should not only ban it but also use this technology. Unfortunately, I can't come up with ideas like this. But some will come up with them. So we should give many people and companies incentive banning illegal use. Therefore we will use this technology successfully."
NBE02874,We finally create the real gun by using only just a printer. But we should think it more helpful way for our lives. For instance we perhaps can make some artificial organs for the medical purpose. It is also alright to make cars by it. Making guns should be prohibited.
NBE05584,"A 3D printer is surely useful and important in various fields such as medicine, but it can be used in the way like this article. In Japan, there has not been any regulations on 3D-printed guns yet. So, the government should seriously deal with this situation while encouraging medical use of a 3D printer."
NBE02735,"When I read this article, I remembered how I was not good at learning vocabularies. I know there are many ways to learn English. I had used the first, second and third example style of vocabulary notes. Personally, the second example style was good for me because writing example sentences made it possible for me to remember vocabularies easily. On the other hand, I didn't know the fourth and final example style of vocabulary notes. Though I'm not sure if those style of vocabulary notes are fit for me, I want to use them next time."
NBE01669,"I also think vocabulary notebooks are one of the most useful tools for learning a language. But in my case, I get a feeling of satisfaction by only writing vocabulary at notes, so I do not review. For example, I only listen to classes absentmindedly during writing vocabulary at notes. If I do not listen to classes because I write notes, it is all over for both of me. So I think that that is not necessarily useful tools to learning a language by using vocabulary notebooks."
NBE02760,"This article is very helpful for me in learning language. I have used only the first example style of vocabulary notes when I make it. In addition, I sometimes missed information of word without Japanese meanings. Therefore, I will adopt second, third, fourth and final example style of vocabulary notes in my way of learning language to improve my vocabulary skills."
NBE02630,"I made flash cards to learn vocabulary or words. This is quick and easy way to remember but is not the most effective method. I never used word maps like the fourth or the fifth example. However, these ways are good ways to study vocabulary that I want to use actively in speaking and writing. So I will use word map to learn vocabulary."
NBE01541,"When I finished reading this article, I was surprised to know that there are a lot of ways to learn new words. Until now I always used only the first or second examples. I think it is important to be able to use English practically, such as speaking fluently or writing clearly. So I decided to use other three ways to learn new words. Now I want to learn as many collocations as possible in order to use easy words practically. I also thought that example sentences are useful to learn new words easily."
NBE02381,"Honestly speaking, I do not really like listing new words in vocabulary notes. I can't be bothered making time for it. When I was in junior high school, I tried to make special English vocabulary notes, but gave up for it soon. It was so time-taking that I had no choice but that. I wasn't satisfied just to list Japanese meanings, and wanted to write almost everything written in a dictionary. Instead of making vocabulary notes, I always try to remember and save vocabularies in my brain. In order to do so, I read many passages aloud again and again. After that, vocabularies and collocations are naturally memorized in my brain. I recommend everyone to have a try at this method because it really works!"
NBE02500,"When I read this article, I found that there were a lot of ways to learn English. Until now, I usually used the first example of vocabulary notes. In addition to, I'd like to use the third example of vocabulary notes. However, I don't like the second, fourth and final example of vocabulary notes, because I can do without Japanese language. Before I speak, use and write English, I involuntarily think the content in my brain by Japanese language. So I can't think things by English. In my opinion, English is tool for telling foreigner what I think."
NBE02137,"I do not like studying English because memorizing English vocabulary is not easy for me. But, I think my way of memorizing vocabulary may be bad after reading this article. Especially, word map is very devastating. If I change the way of studying English, I may be good at English. So, I decide to use many ways to study English because I believe Try and Error is important for everything."
NBE01929,"When I learn English, it is the hardest that I learn a word. I remembered a word by the first method so far. However, I noticed that the way was non-efficiency by having read this sentence. I cannot make English sentences even if I remember the meaning of the word in Japanese. However, if I am going to learn all in English like second instance, my burden becomes big. Therefore I think that the vocabulary notebook which added Japanese to the fourth example and the fifth example is good. I think that ""word map"" is the most helpful for myself."
NBE02058,"I think to make vocabulary notebook is important, but I'm satisfied with just build up word book. So I rarely read word book. I study English, especially vocabulary only before the exam. Method is just read vocabulary few times. I couldn't memorize any words and I often got terrible score. Recently, I think it's important use and talk English as much as possible, so I'll try to talk in English with my friends who live in U. K."
NBE02263,"I usually used the vocabulary notebooks like the first example, because it is the clearest and easy to make. But I try to write the meanings of the words in English since my English teacher of high school used the dictionary of English which definitions are given all in English. In fact, I realized the enrichment of my vocabulary. Personally, writing the words which I made mistakes by the blue ball point pen is also effective for memorize. I think the ideal vocabulary notebook is different with each person. Exchanging the vocabulary notebooks with friends seems pleasant."
NBE02475,"This articles is very interesting for me. Because, I thought that style of vocabulary note is only one. It is just the first example. It is very useful for examination. But I read this article, I thought this way was wrong. Most interesting method for me is collocations. Immediately, I think that want to try it to next examination."
NBE01566,"My vocabulary notebook is similar to the first example introduced in the second paragraph, but I usually add parts of speech and phonetic symbols for the purpose of making sure the pronunciation of the words. This way is easy to check whether I remember all the listed words over and over, but is not helpful to learn how to use them in real situations. In this article, there are many ways which I have never tried such as word maps and collocations. They seem to be very efficient ways to increase your English vocabulary and to enrich your English expressions at the same time. For learners of English and other languages, it is most important to try many ways of vocabulary notes and find out the fittest one for each of them."
NBE02086,"I especially agree with the writers's opinion at 'first example'. I've seen many Japanese students do this way of vocabulary learning. But many of them can't use those words in the test and in English conversation because their memories and knowledge monotonous and unstable. English vocabulary can only be acquired from sentences, documents, and actual practice, i think. So I often use the method which is close to 'second example'. But I don't usually use 'fourth example', the collocation method, so I would like to try on that."
NBE02655,"I'm sure that each style has both merits and demerits. The first, Japanese meanings, is the simplest way to learn a language and most of Japanese students should start with this way. This is because they want to get a good score on the very test, that is to say, the way is the most useful to look only for the result on a test. However, the higher the learning advances, the less it can be widely applicable. Therefore, we have to change the way for vocabulary note into the others gradually. Personally I regard synonyms as the most important element for vocabulary notes. Actually I make it a rule to write synonyms in free spaces as much as possible because acquiring synonyms are an essential skill when we express our opinions in details or write an essay. But I haven't got enough collocations yet, so I am going to try other different ways such as word maps or word families."
NBE02682,"I used vocabulary book like first example, so this article sounds interesting for me. And I found from this article that the way to learn English is various. For me, the most interesting way to learn English is using collocations. So I want to try to learn English by using collocations."
NBE02212,"When I was a high school student, I used to make vocabulary notebooks like second and third example. I tried not to use Japanese except translation of technical words and added synonyms, example sentences and collocations. Those notebooks actually helped me to learn English a lot. To learn a foreign language, it is effective to try to think in the language you are learning to improve your language skill."
NBE02606,"Until recently I used vocabulary notebooks like first example, because it was easy to write only English words and Japanese meanings. However, this type depends on only memory. Therefore, when I tried to write an English essay, I could not express my thoughts well. It was not until then that I realized that learning a language should be active. So, now, I use vocabulary notebooks like second example."
NBE02357,"When I read new sentences or articles, I don't know words are the more, I carefully read them again and again. Although I check the words, at this time I have doubts making a vocabulary notebook whether the really effective to improve English skills. Because I think learning new words should learn them in the text. Certainly, I can see new words at a glance by listing up them and deeply understand as to them by writing their meaning and so on. But vocabulary is one of the sentence, so I think learning vocabulary in the sentence is hard to forget. In case of making a vocabulary notebook, I think the second example in the article is effective."
NBE02580,"I was trying to memorize English words the way like the first examples when I was a student preparing for an entrance examination, for I was too busy to write other things on my vocabulary notebooks. And actually, it's effective to only read English texts. But now we need not only to read them but also to express our opinions clearly, so I want to try the fourth example, a good way to study vocabulary that I want to use actively in speaking and writing."
NBE02009,"The most attractive example for me is the second example after reading this article. Because the second one is a vocabulary notebook for remembering words and to enable using words in real life. I was too busy memorizing vocabularies but now, I want to study learning vocabularies for practical use."
NBE01720,"I had often tried to memorize words with the first example. But I have avoided other cases because whenever I tried such examples, it made me more confused. But after reading this blog, I knew that it has many missing points. I thought that I should try other methods to brush up my skill. By the way, looking the poll questions, I found that many students voted the first example like I had tried. I was relieved."
NBE01472,"I've been studying method that remember the word that appears in reading the text until now. I also tried first and second example to learn a word pledge, but I feel it was hard to remember the word without any related. But I know third, fourth and final example this time, I think relating the meaning of the word with each other may be effective. I'd like to try these methods."
NBE02237,"I have studied English by the wordbook. However, I had done only the first example. It got to know that I read this report and there were the various studying methods. I think that I will learn using the studying method different from usual from next time."
NBE02711,"When I study vocabulary, I often use the first, second and third example style of vocabulary notes. Reading this article, I found that there were many styles of vocabulary notes for learning a language. Now I would like to use the forth example style using word maps and collocations, for I want to use vocabulary actively in especially speaking and writing. Moreover I think that I would like to find the style that is more suitable for my aim of using the notes."
NBE01447,"I usually used vocabulary book like first example. I thought this way was most useful to learn English. After I read this article, I change that thought. I think the most effective way to learn English is using example sentence. I think I can use English in real situation by using this way. I decide to learn English by using example sentence."
NBE01612,"When I was a high school student, I used first and second style and didn't notice the other styles. I learned by this article that the style of studying is abundant and I should try to find the best style suit to a goal. Now I want to brush up my English writing skills, so I want to try the fourth style."
NBE02162,"Vocabulary notes are certainly important for learning languages. I'm using the first example of vocabulary notes. I read this article, I found some hints to improve my notes. I will try new ways."
NBE01784,"I always used the vocabulary notebooks like the first example, because it is easy to learn it very much and is easy to make it. However I forget the meaning of the word immediately even if I can learn it, and can't learn right pronunciation by this method. I can't talk using English in such a state. Therefore, I thought the method that could learn meaning of the word and right pronunciation like the third example is wonderful. When I make vocabulary note next, I want to make it with this method."
NBE02334,"After I read this article I knew how vocabulary note are good tool to study vocabulary. I'm not good at vocabulary, Then I realized my way of study vocabulary was not good, so that I will try first, second and third example of vocabulary note."
NBE01310,"Vocabulary Notebook is very familiar with me, in particular , when I studied for exam to enroll keio university. So I have own preference with it. It may be categorized in the first example on this article. However, I add part of speech to my notebook. And I would like Vocabulary Notebook to be compact to bring around in any time. That is because, I use very small notebook. As a result, I can see it on train with full people in morning. Finally, I want to conclude as this. ""The best style is what you like. """
NBE01494,"I think example sentences are the most important of all. If I don't know the mean of the word, I can look up it in a dictionary. But it is only to know the mean of the word. The most important thing is understanding the way of using the word. We tend to be satisfied only to search the means, but we have to how to use and make example sentences after searching. I think there's no perfect method because all method doesn't include example sentences , but I have to choice one. So I choose word senses because it's the simplest method so it is quick and easy to do. But it also misses important information ""how to use"". So if I make vocabulary notebooks, I add not only means but also how to use. After looking up means, I try to make example sentences."
NBE01363,"I think that we should learn example sentences together when we learn words. We may not understand how to use if we learn only a word. I think It has a meaning that we learned a word only after we can use it for a conversation. And then, I think that if we learn the same word of the meaning of a word, It is hard to forget the meaning and the method is efficient."
NBE01258,I think after reading this topic that there are many way of leaning language. I had not thought way of leaning. And I remember that my english teacher told us to remember english words with sentence. I think that it is very important for me to lean english words with sentence. So I want to become to lean english words with sentence.
NBE01981,"This article is really interesting for me. When I was a high school student, I would often use Vocabulary Notebooks to pass university entrance exams. They are constituted by Japanese forms. However, this article insist that this forms are not efficient. Here, I think this is not true. Why? Because I have got the ability to write and read English by this Vocabulary Notebooks."
NBE01905,"When I was candidate, I often made vocabulary notebooks. And my vocabulary notebooks are like the third example. I made much of word family when I made vocabulary notebooks. I think word family is one of the most important things when you make a vocabulary notebook. It is because you can learn a lot of expressions. So you can avoid using same expressions."
NBE02313,"When I was studying English for entrance exams, I made my own vocabulary notebooks instead of using a wordbook on the market . I tried almost all of the styles that Mr. Marchand suggests on the article and incorporated all of them into my notebook. Naturally, it made me confused when reviewing the words because there were too much information. So from now on, I will try to make a simple but efficient word book like the examples and focus on the forth example in particular. Being too greedy is not good for learning words, I suppose."
NBE01232,"I can't memorize many vocabulary. I always do to write the English words at the front, the Japanese words at the back. This way is the most famous way in Japan. But today I can study the a lot of way to learn vocabulary. I don't know the way of word map. I want to try it!!!"
NBE01832,"There are various examples about the note of a vocabulary. I thought that it was very interesting. I was using the first method. It writes the meaning of a word and Japanese to a note. I have understood the meaning of the word. However, I cannot use a word well. I write the method of using a word to the note of a vocabulary. I thought that it was good for me."
NBE01808,"I made vocabulary notebook like the first example. I tried to write english meanings, but I was tired of writing them and it took much time. Finally, I wrote only Japanese meanings. I thought the second example was ideal but actually, if I made notebook by myself, I could memorize vocabularies. In conclude, I think we can learn vocabularies speedy and easily if we find own favorite way of making notebooks. To make it, we should try some examples and adopt an efficient idea."
NBE01692,"I think that keeping vocabulary notebook is necessary to improve our English skill, because we may forget the words unless we review them a few times. However, I don't do it. whenever I encounter the word which I don't know or don't remember, I just search them in dictionary. It's because I think taking much time to make vocabulary notes is not good, while I think it's important. but, it's true that I don't know where to study for English vocabulary, though I need to them, because I didn't keep them. Therefore, I must begin keeping vocabulary notes with thinking how I don't waste time, and now one way has occurred to me. It's writing nothing but words I don't know. when I write on note, I search them in English- English dictionary, and check example sentences and listen to the pronunciations. When I study with the notebooks, I search it in the dictionary if I find the word I has already forgot. It's the best in the way to save time; I can take much time for the words which are difficult for me to memorize and I don't to have to spend time for the word which are easy for me to remember. Anyway, I think that each one has different character, must create the original way to keep vocabulary notes, and should continue amending it."
NBE02183,"Last year I studied English a lot for entrance exams. I used vocabulary notebooks example1. By reading this article, I think that I should use the second example type because I wanted to improve my reading skills. Also, I'd like to use other vocabulary notebooks."
NBE01587,"I used to learn vocabulary by using Japanese meaning when I was high school student. And I still think that the most important element is Japanese meaning. But after reading this page, I began to think that it's good idea to learn English meaning at the same time. So I'm planning to do it from now on."
NBE01282,"I used the vocabulary note like the first example. It isn't the best way to learn English vocabulary, but it's necessary to do so. In fact, English meaning of English word is necessary for English writing, but Majority of us need not study English writing well. Now, I study English to communicate with English people. To do so, it's more necessary to learn word's collocation, pronunciation. I'm going to use these ways."
NBE02527,"When I read this article, I remembered that I used to made flash cards. But this way learning English vocabulary or words is not useful when I talk with people in English. So I think learning word's collocation is necessary!"
NBE01339,"Come to think of it, I used the many kinds of methods to memory English vocabulary . At first, I made use of flash cards, but this way didn't fit me. As soon as I found out the fact, changed the way. Now, I think everyone should know the way which suits themselves."
NBE02430,"My way of making a vocabulary notebook is the first one. And when I was in high school, I used vocabulary note on the market. These are the easiest way and not troublesome. However, world map attracted me because it appeared to be a enjoyable way. Just remembering words is boring for me so word map might give me some new driving forces to study :)"
NBE01955,"I like to learn how to study efficiently . So this article is very useful for me. When I was ""JUNKENSEI"", I hoped to memorize new words as easy as possible. So if I had known contents of this article, I have been more intelligent."
NBE02292,"I wrote the meaning of the word in the article in many cases. However, I thought that I would make a vocabulary note after reading this article. It is the important to collect after all the words which I do not understand."
NBE01855,"I don't like making tool for memorize or study because I think it is a waste of time . So I seldom make a word list. But I think it would be good to make a word list. ""word families"" and ""English meanings"" are important to know a lot of English word. Maybe another elements are also important to be a good English speaker, I think."
NBE02112,"I made vocabulary notes when I was a high school student. That note concluded Japanese meanings, accent and pronunciation. I read this news and thought I should have written collocations on that note. However, I hardly had reviewed the note. I used 'TARGET 1900' to memorize English word. I don't know whether it is good or not."
NBE01744,"I think the second example is the best way to learn new languages and new words. You pick up the sentences including unknown words and expressions in notebook and read them again and again, then you can not only remember the meanings of the words but learn how to use them. This way of studying will also helps you to understand new languages as they are, with no work of translation."
NBE02663,"I strongly agree with your idea. When trying to make vocabulary notes, we always generally reluctant to take notes in a well-constructed style. Although I was also making a special vocabulary notebook like a dictionary before, now I regard repeat reading and writing as the most important way to memorize words. Making own notes only gave us wrong fulfillment while it doesn't gave firm knowledge. Therefore, I think making vocabulary notes is not always effective to learn words."
NBE02411,"I always use flash cards to learn new words. They are very easy to carry around and I can use them everywhere like on the train. And they are very easy to make, I just have to write the word on one side and on the other side I need to write meaning and something important. But the flash cards are not very big so they are not big enough to write example sentences or synonyms. After I read this article, I thought the second example is the best way to learn new words. It includes English meanings and example sentences. They would be very useful when you find the word in the long sentences next time."
NBE02413,I agree with this comment. I also used flash cards to learn new words. But I also found learning English words in this way would not help when I talk to someone in English. I would like to find other good way to learn new words.
NBE01397,To note is very important thing when we learn new words. Writing words and phrases is helpful to us to study. I want to use word map to skill up my vocabulary.
NBE01419,"When I was a high school student, I didn't make vocabulary notebooks very much. Instead of making my own vocabulary notebooks, I used one which were pressed. [ID13036] said in comment that "" I used 'TARGET 1900' to memorize English word. I don't know whether it is good or not. "" I think that is good, because buying and using vocabulary notebooks which which words are already printed on can saving time."
NBE02561,This article is very useful and makes us to think about how we should study English. I think third example is best. I believe that we are easy to remember new words with sentences. So using speech and so on is very good for us.
NBE06384,I think that fourth example is the most useful notebook. That is because this notebook include some sentences to use words in daily life.
NBE06627,"When I looked this article, I realized how I was not good at vocabulary learning. I become to know there are many types of vocabulary notebooks. Personally, the second example's style was the best for me because writing example sentences made it easier for me to remember vocabularies. I also think vocabulary notebooks are one of the most useful tools for learning a language. But in my case, I used vocabulary notebooks only for tests. So, I'm going to try make notebook which can improve my speaking skills."
NBE07180,"I strongly believe that the vocabulary notebook plays the most significant role when learning foreign languages. Whether we put collocation, pronunciation, synonyms and etc depends on our purpose which we would like to improve as listening or speaking and so on."
NBE06441,"I think that it is to place an example to be important in making a vocabulary notebook. This is because we have to not only understand the meaning of the word, but also use the word in sentence. I intend to put down the use with a meaning in a word to come across for the first time after now."
NBE02453,"He is incredible. Also this news will give old people new power. Japanese society is aging. Because of this young Japanese people will be imposed burdens on. However, like this news, if old people do more for the society, burdens on young people is gonna be lighter."
NBE02712,"When I read this article, I was surprised at the 80-year old Japanese mountaineer. These days our life span is getting so long and Japanese people are getting aging. There are many elderly people who need nursing. I think that this article will encourage not only elderly people but also young people. Having read the news, I was stimulated by his action and statement. So I came to think that I would like to challenge and try things confronting with me, doing my best , and to finish a full marathon race when I am 80 years old in the future. If many people including the elderly and young are stimulated or encouraged like I was, our society will be full of vitality."
NBE01542,"I am proud of this great achievement because we Japanese get the position as the record holder of the world. I think climbing is a reason for living for Mr. Miura, and he seems to be enjoying climbing, so I want to have one thing which I can challenge my limits, too. Now I have a hobby of table tennis which I played through my junior high school and high school days. Therefore, I decided to challenge my limits through playing it and improving its skills. I also want to find more hobbies which make me so eager that make me quite well even when I get older."
NBE02736,"HIs achievement was so amazing. I have never imagined such an old person could conquer a mountain. I respect his great challenging spirit and also be proud of him as a Japanese. Though he had hardship that he broke his pelvis and left thigh in 2009 and has also had a number of operations on his heart, he never gave up. It is admirable. At the same time, I am surprised that Mr Sherchan, now 81, is set to tackle the mountain again next week. They must be good friends as the competition because they spur each other. I think their friendship is wonderful, so I hope I will have such friends and live actively when I'm a octogenarian."
NBE01982,"I was really surprised to hear that Japanese 80-year-old claimed Everest record. According to this article, ""he said scaling Everest was about challenging his limits"". Challenging limits is important when you try to achieve your goal. You should fight you, not others. He taught us this idea by claiming Everest. I want to challenge my limits like him. However, I have already challenged my limits though university entrance exams. So, I should find a new goal. Eventually, my small goal is not to forget things now."
NBE02264,"I have an 80-year old grandfather. He had practiced kendo and aikido in his school days. He's awfully good at doing kendo and aikido. In fact, he was the captain of the kendo club in University. But, in these years he has been bedridden. He becomes less energetic. After reading this article, I thought that Mr. Yuichiro is lucky and envied him. I want my grandfather to have the world's best feeling like Mr. Yuichiro. I am going to visit my grandfather this weekend, so I will tell him this story about Mr. Yuichiro. Mr. Yuichiro's achievements stimulate a competitive spirit. I hope this story bring my grandfather his vitality again."
NBE02358,"When I read this article, I was very surprised and I thought we can make our dream come true unless we give it up. And his challenge that is very hard even if he is young so he should praise. I have ever climb the mountain is quarter as high as Everest but I took many hours to reach the top of this mountain so I remember to climb with desperately. That he achieves the feat like this is suppose to give much courage and many dreams to many Japanese elderly people. Japanese society is said that decreasing birthrate and aging population. By increasing elderly people, Japanese society may look like an exhausted condition. But, if this opportunity will make elderly people fine and activate society , Japanese future will be bright."
NBE02059,"When I was junior high school student, my teacher said ""We don't have to give up because of our age. I think ""I was too young to. . . "" or ""I'm too old to. . . "" are not the reason to don't difficult thing. "" I was impressed. However Mr. Miura is fantastic, I wonder what makes climb the mountain him. By the way I think he has young and stout mind. I want to be the old man who has kiddy heart and keep challenging something. Congratulations Mr. Yuichiro Miura!"
NBE02382,"I was very impressed by reading this article. I hadn't known that there is such a brave man like Mr. Miura in the world. Even though I am young and healthy, I would not try to reach the summit of Mount Everest now. I am too afraid to be in a situation which is dangerous, thrilling and tiring. Of course what Mr. Miura has done is rewarding. What I am proud of him the most is the fact that he has a great hobby at age 80! He thinks that he cannot be happier to be at the summit of Everest than anywhere else. I think it is wonderful for an elderly man to say so. I would like him to keep having a hope of going for a climb again and again in the future. His enthusiasm for mountaineering will have probably been giving many people motivation to live."
NBE01670,"I was surprised at the news. If I were eighty, I would not think that I try to climb the mountain because I would not think that I want to take on my limits. So I respect him. Now, I do not know how person I will be when I will eighty, but I want to have challenging mind."
NBE02111,"I think he is a great person and I respect him. However, I don't want to climb Mt. Everest. The reason why I don't want to climb Mt. Everest is I still don't want to die. Climbing is very dangerous. There is a possibility that a snowslide happen and there is little oxygen. What we can do is different each other. So I think we should do best on something. It's worth climbing Mt. Everest and it's enough."
NBE02761,"I was so impressed by Yuichiro Miura's great achievement. I have not climbed high mountain. However, I understand climbing Everest is unimaginable hard and there is low possibility that healthy and young man achieve climbing Everest. Therefore, climbing Everest by Yuichiro Miura who is 80 years old and decline of his strength is unbelievable thing. I want to follow a his example and go over my limit."
NBE02501,"When I heard this news for the first time, I can't believe it. Generally speaking, those who are 80 years old can't climb the mountains. However, Mr. Miura could climb Mt. Everest which is the highest mountain all over the world at age 80. Of course, his efforts brought him the remarkable feat of conquering Everest at age 80, but it is more important to keep having challenging spirit by age 80, in my opinion. Challenging spirit means that we have to make a great effort to try our limits. Maybe, it is more easy to think that there is a limit to what one person can do, but challenging limit is really difficult and too hard. So Mr. Miura is one of the great people in the world. When I am 80 years old, II want to be a challenging man, such as Mr. Miura."
NBE01567,"I really respect Mr. Miura, who has kept challenging regardless of his age. In addition, he didn't give up scaling Everest though he broke pelvis and thigh and had a number of operations on his heart. Unlike him, most people, including me, generally don't challenge their limit, giving a plausible excuse. Mr. Miura's great achievement strongly showed that it is never too late to challenging your limit. I believe that his challenging spirit inspired not only elderly people yet young people to challenge their limit. I would like to study harder toward my goal in the future, and also would like to keep challenging at the age of 80."
NBE02656,"First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr. Miura for his great achievement. I can't believe an 80-year old man scaled the highest mountain in the world. Moreover, I have to take my hat off to him for challenging spirit or motivation. Although it seems to be broken his record soon again, I feel like Mr. Miura will try it several years later. Also, in my opinion, the record is only a by-product of his effort, the most important thing about his various achievements is to encourage people to do anything irrespective of one's age. Probably he himself also has such a mind. I can't understand old people's distress very well because I am still young. However his activity and behavior undoubtedly inspired me to greater effort and energy."
NBE02657,"Also, in my opinion, the record is only a by-product of his effort, the most important thing about his various achievements is to encourage people to do anything irrespective of one's age. Probably he himself also has such a mind. I can't understand old people's distress very well because I am still young. However his activity and behavior undoubtedly inspired me to greater effort and energy."
NBE01520,"I was surprised at this news and I think he is a great person and I respect him. However, I don't want to climb Mt. Everest. Because I still don't want to die. Climbing is very dangerous. There is a possibility that a snowslide happen and there is little oxygen. But Mr. Miura is one of the great people in the world. When I am 80 years old, I eager to be a challenging man, such as Mr. Miura."
NBE02293,"when I heard that an 80-year old Japanese mountaineer has reached the summit of Mount Everest, I was very surprised. And I got courage from him. He taught me to continue challenging his dream irrespective of age. However, I cannot believe his physical strength or efforts which are 80 years old."
NBE01448,"I was surprised to hear that news. His achievement encourage many people in the world. Mr. Miura tried difficult thing. If I were him, I could not think such a thing. I think everybody should have courage to try things like Mr. Miura. I hope the world will be filled with dream."
NBE01613,"I respect Mr. Miura for his spirit to never stop challenging. Generally, old people stop challenging for their age and only tell and yearning for their heroic episodes which they made when they were young. I don't say their habits are bad, but Mr. Miura's positive attitude is wonderful and I want to follow his example."
NBE02631,"I was so surprised when I watched this news on TV first time. I doubt it is possible for 80 years old man to climb Mt. Everest. But Mr. Miura did!! I am proud of him because he gave hope to many people, of course he gave it to me also. I want to be a man like him and would do some great thing in the future."
NBE02138,"This new makes me excited very much. There is many bad news in Japan recently. But, this news will encourage many people. And I understand the importance of ""Challenge"". I am not good at playing sports and can not do things like Yuichiro Miura . But I want to challenge many things from now. First , I must study English harder."
NBE01473,"It is incredible that the man 80-year-old climbed Everest. I think his courageous challenge cheer many old man. In that sense, there is opinion that he can get a People's Honor Award. I also agree with that opinion, and think his feat deserves that."
NBE02010,"I am surprised at his stamina. If I am same his age, I would only spend every day watching TV at home. So his challenge is not easy task. I was encouraged to it! I thought I want to live in active everyday as I would not regret everyday!"
NBE02607,"I was so surprised and excited at this news. Mr. Miura broke our fixed ideas that the elderly cannot always do whatever they like. Moreover, he showed us the idea that we can do anything when we try it in earnest. The age, gender, or nationality are entirely not related to your challenge. If you want to make it, you only do it at your best. He set a personal example about it."
NBE01637,"I think Mr. Miura is the proud of Japan. He had bore many hardships and finally made his dream come true. Surprisingly, he is now 80! I'm much more younger than him, but I have never dreamed of climbing Mt. Fuji, much less Mt. Everest! We can learn many things from his challenge to Mt. Everest."
NBE02087,"Just amazing!I can hardly imagine that an old man older than me by 50, 60 years old not only tried climbing mt. Everest but also reached the top!He is a man of strong will . I think I should learn from him and try many things and won't give up. I must live my life more preciously, exert all my strength to live."
NBE02581,"I'm proud of him as a Japanese. He showed the fact that effort lets us conquer everything. And I praise him especially for having tried to go beyond his own records and having said scaling Everest was honoring ""the great Mother Nature"". This spirit is needed now, the time human beings aim to defeat nature, by developing science technology."
NBE01930,"I do not like mountain climbing very much. Therefore think that that he intends to climb the mountain is great beside he is 80 years old. Probably his record would can blunder immediately, but his action taught a Japanese the importance of ""a challenge"" and ""the effort"". when I read this sentence, I think that I wanted to do many sports when I'll become an old man. It is important for all age to challenge and to effort. I wanted to challenge something with every effort, too."
NBE02406,"I was surprised at this news and I think his achievement is amazing. This news gave huge power to the old people. Not so many people have ever imagined that such an old people could claim Mt. Everest. He should be proud of himself. I think it is amazing that he has a great life even he gets so old. A lot of old people have no energy to try something big. After I read this article, I thought that I want to keep trying something new even after I get so old."
NBE02431,"I can't believe that the old man reached the world's highest peak , nevertheless it is difficult for the young and powerful people. Furthermore he accomplished three times! I was also surprised that not only he but Nepali man challenged a such a crazy thing. their tough body and challenging spirit are so amazing. I was impressed so much. The news would motivate many people. In fact, I understand what Mr. Miura says, but, I would like to spend time leisurely with my lovely grandchildren at the peaceful and safe place, not at the peak of mountain, in my old age:)"
NBE01233,"I believed that people have an impossible thing. But this news made me think about possibility of human! I think to climb needs a lot of physical strength, so an old man can't do it, and I have never doubt such a thing. This maybe made people the wall of impossibility. But today this wall was broken! I can try a lot of thing not to make the wall. Today, people have a wall of impossibility, But I suggest ""Try something before to think!"
NBE01906,"I was very surprised at his vitality. When I heard the news, I couldn't believe that Mr. Miura really climbed Mount Everest even though he was 80 years old. I respect him very much. If I come to be his age, I want to have vitality as he has. I like cycling. So if I have vitality when I'm old, I could enjoy cycling through my life. I think such life must be very fun. I want to enjoy my life like him."
NBE02684,"When I read this article, I think that he is superhuman for his age. Because I can not imagine that old person like 80 years old will do such a hard thing. And if I were 80 years old, I would not do so. If anything, his challenge should be honored. I strongly think that he is great."
NBE02476,This article made me encouraged. What would I be doing at age of 80. I want to enrich the college to become cool old man. And I want to be enrich the life. Therefore I have to have sense of purpose always. By doing so I able to get a sense of satisfaction when I'm 80 years old.
NBE01956,"I can't image when I am 80. I was surprised at this news. I thought Yuichiro Miura is a great Japanese. But actually, I can't know true value of his great achievement. Because I am 18 yet. I can't know how person's 80s is. So I can't image what become of my body and mind when I am 80. I hope to be like Yuichiro Miura when I am 80."
NBE02552,"When I was a junior high school student, I belonged to the hiking club. So I climbed many mountains and know how hard we climbing. Though he is 80-year-old, he challenged the world's highest peak. I am surprised at his challenging spirit. I follow a his spirit and want to keep my challenging spirit like his."
NBE01259,I think that it is not easy for man who is 80 years old to climb mountain. Because climbing a mountain needs effort and training. And old man does not have physical strength. So it is difficult for old man to continue to train. But Mr. MIURA climbed mountain. So I think that he continued to strive every day. I don't keep working hard now. So I want to be a man like Mr. MIURA.
NBE02238,"I respect Mr. Miura. I think that it is very difficult to train the body even if it becomes advanced age. I think that I continue wanting him to continue to challenge. Even if a world record is broken, I would gain the summit once again and would like you to break record."
NBE01833,"Mr. Miura is a wonderful person. I have climbed a mountain. I think that it was serious for 80 year old Mr. Miura to climb Mount Everest. However, probably, Mr. Miura looked at the scene from a very beautiful scenery. It could also be said that the spectacle is equivalent to a life for Mr. Miura surely."
NBE01364,"I think Mr. Miura is great because he is not satisfied after his dreams come true and he has continued challenging. However, I felt that not only he but also his son was great. Ordinary, if own old father challenges a dangerous thing, son and daughter persuade him to stop challenging, but he support his parent and climbed together putting himself to danger. I think he is an understanding son. I think this great achievement was accomplished thanks to the son's support as well as his perseverance."
NBE02528,"I was so surprised at his achievement. He said ""scaling Everest was about challenging his limits and honoring. "" I think his courage is modeled by not only old people but also young people. He teach us that the efforts would pay off."
NBE01785,"When I read this article, I couldn't believe Mr. Miura's action. I don't like mountain climbing because it is very dangerous and there is a possibility of death. However he climbs mountain at 80 years old. When the human gets older, a physical ability and a judgment ability decrease. He climbs the highest mountain in the world in spite of this fact. That's suicidal! It is surely good that there are a dream and an aim. However, I do not want to do only the dangerous thing such as the his action. I want to live long"
NBE01694,"I believe that challenging our limit is great thing, so I respect Yuichiro Miura. It was really surprising that an 80-year old man scaled Mt Everest. However, I don't think that holding record such as height and age are not so important. each should consider about what can be his limit and don't have to do too dangerous thing for him. Despite his body problem, Mr. Miura achieved it, but I think he was just lucky. It was possible for him to die. Therefore, I think that challenging something is good, but It will involve some risks, so each should make own goal, and try it."
NBE01312,"I think his challenge gave us big brave. We will naturally be old. It is general phenomenon. But even if we are old, whether we challenge actively or not is depend on us. Mr. Shimomura did challenge difficult thing actively. We can follow his example after this."
NBE02335,"I was really surprised about this news. This I's because I have 80 years old grandfather, but he can't even climb steep slope. So that 80 years old man claim Everest is unbelievable news. I was also glad to hear this news because it shows how Japanese old people are healthy and vigorous. This news led to Japan's good image. So I think his achievement is really great."
NBE01854,"I was really surprised to hear this news. When I will become 80 years old, I cannot climb Everest . So I think that he got himself into shape everyday. I respect his sportsmanship!!I follow his example, I also work harder. I am young now, I would like to climb Everest only once."
NBE01496,"After I read this article, I was surprised at that the man whose age is 80 can climb Mount Everest. I imagine when I am 80 years old, the exercise hardest of what I can do is only walking. So I think it is too hard for old man to climb mountain. In addition the mountain which he climbed is highest all over the world! But it is not only his effort but also his family's support. If I am his fall, I may stop him. So his family's trust made the challenge possible. Recently we can hear ""family's ties"" example for example the story of earthquake in Fukushima. But this story is the most impressive story for me."
NBE01881,I was so much impressed by his success. It is the miracle that a 80-year-old man is strong and brave like him. I wish I would be such a strong man when I am 80-year-old .
NBE01283,"Even Naomi Uemura, who was one of the best climber in the world, reached the summit of Mt. Everest when he was about 30 years old and the summit of Mt. McKinley when he was 43 years old (and disappeared). Yuichiro MIura is NOW 80 years old and reached the summit of Mt. Everest. This accomplishment is utterly above the ordinary. If he was questioned ""why you climb mountains?"", there was no wonder he will answer like this: ""Because it is there"" ."
NBE01341,"This news is so amazing because such a old man can climb the highest mountain. His challenge was on TV and I was moved by his brave. I'm sure that his success must energize many people. Moreover, after his summit, he said that he wants to skiing next climbing."
NBE02163,"I think he is the greatest man in Japan. His achievement gave me brave and hope. There is nothing too late to do. We should try to something forever. I think that all Japanese people should be proud of him. Not only he is a challenger not yield to the old but also he overcame the handicap, his broken pelvis and left thigh."
NBE01809,"I saw this news many times on TV. I was really surprised at his challenge. I thought that his record encourage elderly people to try something new. He also makes me change my image of life of after retire. I think i will not do same dangerous thing, but I want to have curiosity as well as him."
NBE01721,"Several years ago, I saw a news about him but he was 75 years old. Although, he was known as the oldest climber to the Mount Everest. So I was so surprised at this age. I can't imagine the spirit to keep No. 1 at any place. On the other hand, I read about Mr Sherchan's article. He had won the record until Mr Miura won the newest record. According to the article, he couldn't get any sponsors and he was forced to give up his challenge. I felt that it is so severe that unless he is No. 1, to get sponsors becomes harder."
NBE02315,"I was very surprised to hear this news and would like to pay my great respect to Mr. Miura. It is not easy to try to challenge our own limits. Unlike him, most of us hate and are afraid to know them. When we are faced with challenging tasks, we tend to feel like giving them up immediately. Also, It is so hard for the elderly people to keep themselves in good health. Today Japan's population is aging quickly. I hope such news will inspire all the elderly people."
NBE02035,"I think it's amazing and powerful news Mr. Miura encouraged not only aged people but also young people. He said ""If the limit of age 80 is at the summit of Mt. Everest, the highest place on earth, one can never be happier, "" His word inspired many people and lighted the people who have been disappointed in their life. I hope the world become more happier."
NBE01745,"I'm very proud of him as a Japanese. He is incredible indeed, but not for his feat of breaking the record. He is not very young but challenging his limit. I'm a 18 year-old boy and I know I'm young enough to achieve something, but I was scared of running the risks. I have to learn something important from his great effort and achievement."
NBE02270,"I agree ID13061's comment. I also have never imagined such an old person could conquer a mountain. I think that all Japanese people should be proud of him. Not only he is a challenger not yield to the old but also he overcame the handicap, his broken pelvis and left thigh. He accomplished a great feat. Follow his amazing achievement, I bear a challenging spirit at everything in mind."
NBE02766,"I agree with naoeID13018. I was also surprised at his achievement. I want to be a great person like him. Therefore, I will try to challenge my limits every time."
NBE01676,"I agree with your opinion. In fact, Japanese society has been aging because of several reasons, for example, a calamity and the recession. I want Japanese society will be get well gradually by reading this article."
NBE01374,"I agree with your opinion that Yuichiro is lucky, and not everyone can become like him, but his results might give courage to people. I think I am encouraged to look at the people of same generation who are active in all respects animatedly. I hope that if we can take a year in good spirits. Did you tell the story of Yuichiro to your grandfather? I hope your story about this article bring a good effect to your grandfather!"
NBE02507,"I agree with you. His success of challenge is so great thing that anyone cannot do. His great challenge encouraged me and makes me recognize the important of challenge, too. So I am going to challenge actively, even if it is difficult for me to accomplish."
NBE02560,"I agree with ID13010's idea that his incredible activity cheer many old people. In near future, the most of population in Japan will be occupied old people. The person such as him cheers them and enlivens the economy ."
NBE01396,"This news is really amazing!! I can't believe it. Mr. Miura had climbed Mt. Everest many times. His body is really strong and healthy I thought. He is Japan's proud, and there're effect of advertising of Japan. That is good thing for us and he brighten up Japanese and all over the world's people."
NBE01316,"I agree with your opinion, especially, ""climbing is a reason for living for Mr. Miura"". Now I'm just a student of certain university. So it may be difficult to discover own reason for living as Mr. Miura's. But students as I have a lot of time that we can use freely. In school life, we will be able to find something that we challenge our limits. Until that time, we have to live studiously."
NBE01858,I agree with him. I also want to be a challenging man. Now I join club activity and challenge to my limit but Mr. Miura's challenge is done with more and more big scale in spite of his age. I really respect him and his mental.
NBE01591,I was so amazed when I heard about this great old men. I think his desire to climb Everest itself gives him energy and power. He may gives his generation a lot of hope. I want him to continue to climb Everest from now on.
NBE01263,I agree with ID13043no415. I also got courage from him and I thought that I could do everything if I tried it very hard.
NBE02587,"I agree with you. I think too that Mr. Miura changed many people, especially old people's mind and encouraged them to try various things, even difficult ones. I also hope the world will be filled with the dream this way."
NBE02533,I agree with Keisuke. I also think he could do this with his family's support! I want to treasure the family's trust.
NBE01422,"When I first heard about this news, I was really surprised, because 80-year-old man climbed the Mt. Everest . My grandmother is 78 years and my grandfather is 82 years and both grandparents have difficulties in walking. So I think Mr Miura is miracle."
NBE02039,"I agree with your opinion. I was very surprised, too! I think he encourages not only elderly people but also Japanese people!! I was also encouraged! :) Japanese elderly population is increasing and birth rate is decreasing. . But I think we can resume to have dream and make effort by his action. I hope Japan will be more cheerful!!"
NBE02790,"I was very surprised at the news very much and also feel happy to know there is such a vigorous Japanese old man. I want to live actively like Yuichiro Miura. In Japan, aging is a very serious problem. However, active old man's stories make us happy, so I want old people to live actively. I think it is a very good thing."
NBE02220,Great!
NBE02191,I think he is very tough. Climbing Everest is very hard for young people. A lot of people have given up climbing to the top. I was cheer up by Mr. Miura.
NBE01773,I think he is incredible and this article will encourage not only elderly people but also young people. I came to think that I would like to challenge and try things confronting with me and my limits after I read this article.
NBE06872,"I'm proud of him as the same Japanese. In Japan, the aging society is regard as one of the serious problems and it is needed to encourage the aged to contribute the domestic production over a long period. I think his great achievement succeeded in inspiring the aged to act positively. He told us that we can realize our dreams, regardless of our own age. I want to pursue my goal even if there are some difficulties like him."
NBE06413,"HIs achievement was fabulous. I cannot have thought that such an old person could conquer a mountain. If accidents occur, he never gave up. It is admirable. In addition, Miura and three other Japanese climbers must be good friends as the competition because they spur each other. I guess that their friendship is beautiful."
NBE06137,"I think achievements of Mr. Miura should be evaluated more. This is because it has been animated Japan that he reached the summit of Everest. In addition, his achievement has given a good image of Japan's elderly to people overseas. I want Mr. Miura to challenge various difficulties and invigorate people in Japan."
NBE07111,"He is great man!! Probably, I cannot climb Everest. Despite I am 18 years old. But he is 80 years old!! I hope I will achieve something, when I am 80 years old."
NBE06320,"My grandfather is 81 years old now . But he cannot walk anymore. So I think that Mr. Miura is wonderful . And we can do at any age, until we have a dream."
NBE05030,"This news is very surprising for me. Most of old people who are about eighty years old are difficult to move smoothly because of lack of stamina. Besides, climbing a mountain, especially Mt. Everest, is pretty dangerous and hard for even professional alpinists. Nevertheless he succeeded to get to the summit, he should be admired more. Even if I were eighty, I wouldn't be able to climb mountains. Aging of the population progresses, Japan have been an aging society in modern times. And I've heard that many young people think that there are several demerits like the symptoms of age when they become senior, so they don't want to age. I'm sure that his achievement will mend these negative images for old people as much as possible."
NBE02880,"Every one knows it is difficult climbing Mt, Everest whether young man or old man. Mr Miura was 80 year old, and had a number of operation on his heart and injury . So it is especially hard thing to climb it. But, he had achieved his goal. I cannot understand why he thought challenge climbing Mt, Everest after 80 year old with knowing many risk. And there were many things about bitter and painful experience when he had climbed Mt, Everest. After all he tried climbing it, so I think there might be waiting something which the only man who achieved to his goal know . And that might be far more marvelous than some hard experience. The news teach me importance about challenge"

The news teach me importance about challenge and trying regardless of age and possibility, so I will make every effort to achieve my goal ."
NBE02889,"I think his challenge is wonderful. Even young people, to climb Everest is difficult. So. what person of 80-year-old climbed the mountain is really great. Compared with him, I am young. But, I am not aggressive than him. So, I have much things to learn from him. every day, since I spend vaguely, this article makes me abject, but I was able to think I should not be satisfied with the current situation."
NBE02878,"I respect for his spirit. Of course his achievement is so great, but it's impressive for me that he decided to climb rather than succeeded in climbing. I was really struck by his eternal spirit, and I want to be a man like him."
NBE02890,"I didn't know Miura until I watched news about him on TV. I think his achievement is the pride of human. The most surprising things is that he decided to climb up Everest in 65 years old. I learned that if we have strong will and never give up, we can start everything at any time."
NBE02884,"I was surprised to hear this news. besides, I was encouraged by his achievements. I am sure we were learned that the age is not related whether we can achieve our each dream by this news. It is not easy for even young men, because I know Mt. Everest is most dangerous and highest mountain in the world. However, he could succeed in climbing Mt. Everest. It is unbelievable for me. I have read a book written by him. The book said that the life always starts from now. I can not forget this word. I respect his life and want to live my life like him. His style of life will influence many people in the world forever."
NBE02888,"I was very surprised that an 80-year old Japanese mountaineer has reached the summit of Mount Everest, when I heard this news. I think that we should proud of him and we should be like him, because he overturned conventional wisdom. After I heard this news, I decide I'll never give up anything because of the age."
NBE02879,"This news may give many people great courage. For myself, Mr Miura's great feat moved me profoundly. His daring spirit with which he tried climbing Mt Everest three times although he suffered from pelvis and left thigh injury taught us many lessons. For example, people can keep trying until they lose their fighting spirits even if people who want to try are at the age of 80. Nowadays, many countries are in aging societies. Especially, Japan is said to become a super-aging society. What may become important for people is not how long they live but how fully they live. It may be the pivotal issue that elders have something to live for. Like Mr. Miura, many elders should have goal which they are eager to achieve and they can enjoy their active lives."
NBE02877,"As everybody know, It is really difficult to reach the summit of Mount Everest. However, Mr. Miura accomplished it when he was 80 years old. It is hard for ordinary old man who is 80 years old even to run fast. This is an amazing news. There is no doubt that Mr. Miura worked very hard to reach the summit of Mount Everest. He must have been had a hard time, but he continued his efforts. I think that it is terrific not only to reach the summit of Mount Everest but also to keep working very hard. I respect Mr. Miura, and I want to be a man who can keep working very hard like him."
NBE02886,"I've never imagined 80-year-old mountaineer could reach the summit of Mount Everest!!!This news not only surprised me but also gave me my resolution. I swear not to give up anything because of handicaps. Though he had handicaps -age of 80 and several injuries - to climb mountains, he challenged climbing. Of course, it is admirable that he actually reached the summit of Mount Everest and it was on record, but especially his courageous decision made a deep impression on me. I think his challenge encouraged people all over the world. I hope more and more people could find things worth doing like him."
NBE02887,"I can't believe this great achievement. It is difficult for people 80 years old to do such a hard exercise like this. But he done. This challenge is not easy. I think there is big effort on his success. He proved that human age is not matter with doing anything. Through this news, I have learned that if I believe I can do, anything can happen and I want to be a man like him."
NBE02876,"This is an unbelievable news! Commonly, it is a very hard and difficult for a person aged 80 to go to just a supermarket. Mr, Miura, however, succeeded to reach the summit of the tallest mountain in the world. I respect for his fight spirit and power to accomplish. I belong to a soccer club, so I'd like to aim for the top with ambition like him."
NBE02882,"Reading this article, i was very impressed and feel motivated. Due to depression, more and more Japanese people, especially young one, tended to feel utterly abandoned and lacked enthusiasm at that time. You can't imagine how much people of that time had their spirits lifted by his great feat. In short, suffice to say that I think he is one of the all-time greats. Thanks for reading."
NBE02885,"When I heard this news, I was surprised very much and got courage very much. In the first place this is because this one climbs Mt. Everest at age of 80 years old to be that it is difficult to climb Mt. Everest. And the point where he is going to challenge once again is splendid while the person that a record was established a new is 81 years old. I want to follow a point working together in competition each other while being this age. I think that it is splendid news to give courage in all."
NBE02883,"I'm surprised when I heard Mr Miura had reached the summit of Mount Everest. Above all his age surprised me. If I were 80 I couldn't reach the summit of Mount Everest absolutely. His age of 80 is unbelievable and gives old people power and courage. Now Japan is aging society with fewer children, active old people will continue to support Japan in the future."
NBE07461,"When I read this article, I was very surprised, and I can't believe that 80-year-old Japanese man reached the summit of Mount Everest. I was exhausted to even scale the summit of Mount Fuji (3776 meters), when I was 14 years old. In order to accomplish his great feat, it's necessary to have not only physical strength but also will power and ambition. It is very important not to forget the mind of challenge regardless of age, I think. His achievement will give power to many people in the world."
NBE06752,"I was so surprised when I read this article first. I think Mr. Miura is a great person and what he did is incredible. He said ""Even at 80, I can still do quite well. "" This ward is impressive for me. I think he continued to challenge his limits even at such an old age. He gave me hope, brave, dream, and so on. I want him to keep challenging."
NBE07240,I was very surprised and proud of his great achievement as a Japanese when I read this article. I learned that oneself must not label one's limit from this article. So I want to challenge various things from now on.
NBE06508,"I was very surprised when I heard this news for the first time. I think he might be able to achieve such a thing because of his own strong desire. For not only elder people but also young people, having an aim and challenging to it again and again is very important. Perhaps, this is the very thing that enjoying one's life. While I'm a college student, I have a lot of free time. So I want to be looking for my aim which I can dedicate myself to."
NBE06207,A man aged 80 reached the summit of mount Everest. . . unbelievable!Nobody would deny the fact that he is the strongest among the people of their 80s! I wonder how he keeps such a powerful body for this long time.
NBE05387,"When I read this article, I was very surprised. I have thought that it is more hard to move their body as their will and there are more restriction to do something as people become old. However, he told us that the age is not the problem of doing something. Today, Japan has more people who are 65 years old or over. However, we can say the opposite that we can live longer. I think if we live having to will to stay alive as him, we can make our life more full."
NBE05506,"When I read this article, I think that there is a lot of possibility to succeed very much if I do my best. It is more dangerous to climb the summit of Mount Everest at 80-year old, but Mr. Miura succeeded it. It is a result of the efforts not a miracle. It was realized by enough preparations, age-appropriate and careful plan, knowledge and confidence by the past experience, cooperation by surrounding people. As a result, he overcame the limits and excited and encouraged us. I think that it is necessary to have thought of a challenge, preparation and experiment to succeed, appreciation to surrounding people who cooperated with me. I want to be a person that touches heart of somebody by impression like him."
NBE06476,"When I read this news, I was surprised at his strong mental power. People of all over the world must be encouraged by his great achievement. Though it is difficult to keep the challenging spirits like him, I 'd like to keep it ."
NBE06778,"It is wonderful that an 80-year-old climber reaches the summit of Mt. Everest , the highest place in the world . His challenge encourages many people in the world to challenge their limits . I respect him. So I think I have to try to deal with a lot of difficulties in front of me."
NBE05799,"I think its really amazing that 80-year-old man climbed the Everest, because my grandpa is about to be 80 and he is on the wheelchair. He can't even walk. I hope he can make the record again later in his life!!"
NBE05116,"When I first knew this news, I was very surprised. In Japan, aging society is unstoppable problem, but it is good thing for elderly people to live healthy. I guess they had better exercise well in order to live healthy and I would like to be a health people even I become old."
NBE06091,"I was very surprised when I read this article. I think this is very wonderful news and I respect him. There are a lot of old people in Japan and almost them don't work. Therefore in the Japanese government, it is hard to pay a pension because there is not people who pay tax and there is a lot of people who receive the pension. This news proof that elderly people can do a lot of things, so they can work. Therefore Japanese company should employ elder people."
NBE06090,"I was very surprised when I read this article. I think this is very wonderful news and I respect him. There are a lot of elderly people in Japan and almost them don't work. Therefore in the Japanese government, it is hard to pay pension because there is not people who pay tax and there is a lot of people who receive the pension. This news proof that elderly people can do a lot of things, so they can work. Therefore company should employ elderly people and give a working chance."
NBE05505,"We have the problem of decreasing birthrate and aging population. so, I think that this news proof that elderly people can do a lot of things, too. They should challenge various things like him, not give up!!"
NBE05834,"When I heard the news, I frankly feel what an 80-year-old Japanese man! Surprisingly, he completed the difficult mission that he had reached the summit of Mt. Everest known as the highest mountain around the world at the age of 80. I hope that I'm as fine as him when I become 80 years old. For the purpose, I should try to go to bed early and get up early."
NBE06170,"This new is amazing. When I heard this news, I think Yuichiro Miura is very powerful old man. Common old people give up for their ages but he never gives up. He claimed Everest record and give all old people fighting spirit. I want to increase such old men."
NBE06169,His fighting spirit and his act change many old people. Not he but other old people should have fighting spirit and heart of never giving up.
NBE06535,"First of all, when I read this news, I felt Mr. Miura was very tough and energetic. I will never feel like climbing Everest, let alone when I'm 80 years old. This news was certain to encourage the old. Now, we have a lot of problems about aging in Japan. But many old people are living healthy. i think young people should challenge many things after their example."
NBE06537,I was surprised too. The aging society has not only a bad side but also good side. We can learn various things from the old. I feel Japanese old people are very active.
NBE06536,"I agree with you. This great achievement shows old people's power. It is said that the number of poor old people is increasing. If they can continue to work, Japanese government or companies should work on the system reform."
NBE06777,"I was surprised when I read this article , too. He is a great man . So , I want to live after the example of him."
NBE06029,"This is very great event and will give many people big hope. Even if we become old, we have possibility to try and do anything. This encourages old people, so now Japanese social will become better, I think"
NBE07078,"I was absolutely stunned by this news of 80 years old Japanese man climbing mount Everest. I am very grateful as a Japanese and also as a same man. I love to play sports and exercise. I am willing to play sports until I die. That is why have so much respect for this man and I have respect on his mentality. Moreover, I expect him to be our model of man who have overcome the difficulty of age."
NBE05439,"When I read the article, I was surprised at 80-year-old Japanese climber. I often went to mountains at high school student. I climbed only Japanese mountains (which are not very high mountains), but I know painfulness of the mountaineering well. Physical strength is important."
NBE07155,"I was surprised at two things when I read the headline. First, it is the man whose age is 80 has reached the summit of Mount Everest. I can not imagine that I climb it even in a simple mountain when I alive at 80-year-old. The older we grow up, the weaker our bodies are. Furthermore, The neighborhood of top of the mountain has less oxygen than the place where we live, and the temperature is below the freezing point. Second, what I was surprised is the man is the Japanese. I have an image that the Japanese is weaker than foreigners. Therefore, this news is proud-hearted for a Japanese. We have to learn the importance to move the bodies from him."
NBE07154,"I agree with your opinion. His act proved the power of old people. Not a few people think we will not be able to do anything such as an exciting. But his act made this idea change, and will become the motivation to challenge new things for many people. I think we have to learn the spirit to change if we age."
NBE05998,"I was surprise too when this article read too. And I almost agree with your opinion. It is sure that Mr. Miura gave him courage to people who know it in the world not only mountaineer but also other people. My father is mountaineer and he said to me that ""when you climb mountain, you are alone, even if you are with your friends, team and so on. You have to save yourself and think about your life. "" His saying means people who reached summit is fought themselves and won themselves. So I think claiming mountain is fighting myself because opponent is nature not human, money and other. Usually we are have to study for future job and performance. In case of worker, have to work for living, social status. But if we enter a mountain once mountain climbing is for our life. We can depend on our skill that have gotten before. Way of life is represented up to then in mountain. So it is great that Mr. Miura reached summit of Mt. Everest. He believed him way of life and himself, does not consider the physical strength. He is 80 yeas old but we are so yang. We can do everything with believing ourselves and I think it!"
NBE02383,"It was shocking for me to hear that more and more people are complaining about the noise of children, as Japanese society ages. However, it was interesting to know the reason why compliments are increasing: aging society makes people less accustomed to hearing and tolerating the noise of children. This should be taken seriously in Japan today, because declining birth rates could be worsened by the problem. If many people keep the stance, young women will not have a choice but to give up child-bearing. Then, the number of taxpayers who have to pay for social security will decrease, while the number of elderly people is increasing rapidly. Considering this problem, I agree with the idea of Kinuko Inoguchi mentioned in the passage. We really have to push child-bearing issues to the top of social agenda to make people think more and more children are needed for future Japan. I would also like them to notice that it is not good for young children to be forced not to make noises."
NBE01983,"Japan has a problem now. It is aging Japan. These days the number of children is decreasing and the number of older people is increasing. The number of labors in Japan will be decreasing in the future if this situation is continuing. It is high time we started to take steps against this problem. However, ""aging Japan complains over the noise of children"". In other words, ""As Japan's population declines, intolerance of children and the noise they make is increasing in a society getting less accustomed to hearing them"". This is a serious problem. We should have a wider mind. If we cannot do that, Japan will not continue to stay superpower in the world. Why? Because old people play by money, but they cannot make money. Young people can make money and support old people. So, now young people is needed. Consequently, we must be tolerant of the noise of children."
NBE01722,"I got angry about the complainers. Children are noisy by nature, and they learn many things by playing and romping. I think declining birthrate seem to make less interest in children. I realized why the declining birthrate is becoming a big issue. Japanese people pay too much attention to their businesses and less attention to their kindnesses. And the national character caused the results. Should we demand reparation for child's growth? Should we require fines when we are disturbed our silence? If people have a little wider mind, the troubles will decrease and Japanese birthrate may increase."
NBE02737,"To tell the truth, I was often uncomfortable with noisy children simply because I couldn't compose myself in that situation. Of course, children are active and because of that they should be noisy. However, it doesn't mean they may do everything what they want to do. I think the number of children who are noisy because they try to get their own way is increasing recently. That's why I was upset about those noisy children. However, after read this news story, I thought there was some truth in what it said. I agreed with Maeda, who said fewer children makes people less accustomed to hearing the noise they naturally make. I also agreed with Hosaka, who said, ""Of course we need to be considerate towards people living in the neighborhood, but it is impossible to make places where children play in total silence. "" So, it's may be important that we come in contact with children and give more chance or place for them to play actively."
NBE02265,"I agree that children are not a social nuisance. Children betray their straight feelings, that's why they are vigor and noisy. But we adult no longer have that candidness. If children became keeping quiet like a doll, the world would lose energy. I think the noise which youngsters make have a power to make people cheerful. In additional, the housings nearby school or day care center must be reduced the price. So people living in the neighborhood should tolerate some noise."
NBE01671,"I also think that it is true that it is impossible to ask children to sit still all day long so they do not make noise. I do not like children because they always make noise. But I understand it is what cannot be helped. So, parents should discipline a child so as to children will not be put to shame in the future. It is no exaggeration to say that the future of children depend on the disciplining of children by parents."
NBE01568,"It is natural that children make some noise when playing outside. Those who complain about the noise children make definitely used to make noise and sometimes used to bother their neighbors when they were children. In addition, I think people should realize that not just parents but all the people in a whole society are responsible for education of children. When I was an elementary school student, I played outside with my friends living nearby my house every day. Their parents and elderly neighbors always greeted playing children and made us greet them back. Moreover, sometimes they told us to be careful of cars and bicycles, not to damage walls and flower beds, and not to make too much noise. Through these kinds of communication with neighbors, my friends and I learned manners in a society. I really appreciate my neighbors who brought me up in a different way from my parents' or school's ones. Recently, it has come to be difficult to help young parents and bring up children by a whole society. However, people have to understand how hard taking care of children is, and afford to worry about young parents and children. I hope that people keep a warm eye on them and communicate with them more frequently so that the number of complaints will decrease."
NBE01365,"I was surprised to read this news. I think running around making noise is unavoidable to some extent and, should be allowed. First, It is necessary for the growth of children to play cheerfully. Almost all the people might made noise when they were children , and they become adults. Why are complainer angry so far? I can't understand them and think they are selfish. It is reasonable to complain if children make noise too much at midnight, but people should permit it in the daytime. Second, it is necessary to make the environment that parents can bring up a child without extra anxiety as a falling birth rate measure. If parents are worried that they are complained to people living in the neighborhood when , they may hesitate to have a baby. This is a bad influence for the whole Japan."
NBE02214,"This might sound ""incorrect"" but I am rather a person who complains about the noise of children. Those noises are simply annoying especially in crowded places. Moreover, I dislike a sort of common sense that everybody should like children and be kind to them. If I say that I don't like kids, many people will think that I'm a cold-hearted person. It is obvious that the declining birth rate problem is serious, tho. To solve the problem, a fundamental reform for the overpopulation in the metropolitan cities, such as Tokyo, is needed. The government cannot force its citizens to be tolerate of the noise children make, but it can lead them by reducing the stress of their life in overcrowded cities."
NBE01366,"I was surprised to read this news. I think running around making noise is unavoidable to some extent and, should be allowed. First, It is necessary for the growth of children to play cheerfully. Almost all the people might made noise when they were children , and they become adults. Why are complainer angry so far? I can't understand them and think they are selfish. It is reasonable to complain if children make noise too much at midnight, but people should permit it in the daytime. Second, it is necessary to make the environment that parents can bring up a child without extra anxiety as a falling birth rate measure. If parents are worried that they are complained to people living in the neighborhood , they may hesitate to have a baby. This is a bad influence for the whole Japan."
NBE02762,"I also feel uncomfortable because of noise children make many times. However, I understand making noise by children is natural things, so I can allow it and it is unbelievable that a lot of people complain about the noise of children. Therefore, I want many people who complain about it to remind of their childhood and kindness of neighborhood."
NBE01543,"I think the government, day care centers and the neighbors should make every effort to overcome this issue. The government should inform more neighbors and other people of the risks that low birthrate and aging society brings such as problems of pensions or decline of the laboring population. And the day care centers should take measures to avoid the conflict. For example, they should more often take children to remote parks where children can play without caring others. And the neighbors should find some hobbies they can enjoy outside the houses where they do not feel unpleasant. The noise causes mainly in the daytime, so the neighbors should go out actively."
NBE02502,"I think that the noise children make should be allowed. It is unfair of people to take children to task for their noise, because most people make noise when they are children. In fact, it is natural that children make noise, so it is impossible to ask children not to make noise. In my opinion, the noise is important for children. When children play with their friends, they are sure to make noise. In other words, the noise is their means of communication that they can express their feelings. Therefore the noise is indispensable for growing up. Of course, their parents need to pay attention to their noise, but it is quite wrong for their neighborhoods to sue them. We don't think the method of decreasing the noise, but we ourselves have to be more tolerant of their noise. If Japan is more broad-minded toward children and their parents, its birthrate will be increasing."
NBE02139,"I think the noise of children is natural things. We should be tolerant for the noise of children because everyone made noise when they were children. In the first place, a man who is not able to allow this noise must cause trouble for someone in no small way. To allow each other is important."
NBE01695,"It's true that people feel it noisy if children play outside. And it often happens to me when I study at home and It is disturbing, but I think we have to bear their noise because it's natural and everyone used to be like this. On the other hand, people have to care their children not to disturb neighborhood at night and in early morning. According to this article, there are many complaints about children's noise now. I think it is problem about not only low birthrate but also weak neighborhood's bond. In old days, people can be tolerant to the noise maybe because they know about each other. children are more noisy but much purer than usual people. And If people spend a few minutes with children and know their purity, they can put up with their noise."
NBE02294,"I was shocked by having got to know this fact. ""We were once told not to take the children for a walk"" because they make too much noise"", said Ms. Maeda. I thought that it was amusing. Naturally it is things that a child frolics. And it is because it is wrong to consider that it is noise. However, although Japan has various problems therefore, it is such a situation. I think that there is probably the necessity that a child understands that it is not social trouble."
NBE01342,"Come to think of it, in my childhood, my parents told me ""go outside rather than stay home"". I used to had a lot of time near my house. The neighborhood maybe felt so noisy, but My neighborhood have never got angry with me For the children, playing with their friends are essential for their mental or physical growth. Certainly, they sometimes don't notice their wrongdoing. At that time, people should point out to them. I'm sure such a tolerance of children is necessary in our society."
NBE02113,"Recently the number of people who cannot tolerate something has been increasing. I'm from Wakayama, where is not so dense with people. Therefore the number of people who complain about the noise that children make is small. When I was an elementary schoolchild, I played in the school ground, but residents near the school didn't complain. I think this problem is not only because a declining birthrate but also a population density."
NBE02658,"I'm sad to know such a complaints get increasing in Japan. As far as the idea is majority in our society, we cannot stop Japan's bad progress for more aged country and we can never re-improve the birthrate. Of course, some complaints are unreasonable and others are reasonable, so I am not going to deny all their criticism about the noise children often make. Still, I insist people should permit children to play outside merrily at least during the daytime because it is the most important activity for children to grow up soundly. Maybe different from many parents' opinion, it is not the most significant education to force their child to study hard from early age. This is because a toddler learns surprisingly numerous things voluntarily. Therefore we had better not restrict children's spontaneity."
NBE01786,"When I read this article, I never believe there are people who accuse about noise at the court. It is natural that children make a noise. When people who hate a noise are childhood, did they not make the noise at all? Such a thing is impossible. When I was young, I made noise at a house, a kindergarten, a road, a shop, a train too. I think that children learn various things in play. We should watch them warmly"
NBE01931,"I thinks that there is no help for it that a child is noisy. It is recognition to raise a child in Great Society not to be enough in present Japan. We should be gentle for the noise of the child more. However, I can understand the feeling of a person thinking that child is noisy. It is that a parent warns a child with moderate condition to be important. It is wrong to complain for a parent making an effort."
NBE02713,"When I read this article, I was shocked to know there are complains about the noise of children. But thinking carefully, I have also complains over it and do not like children because they are so noisy. Calmly thinking, I realized I should change my idea. Children go through so many and various things outside. In that way, they develop their senses and grow up robustly. The complain will put pressure on people having children . However, Japan has the lowest rate of children in the world. According to this article, Japan will be aging and will get less used to hearing children. I am afraid of the future of my country. Children make the future of the country. Considering this problem, I agree with the idea of Kuniko Inoguchi. I thought people should think about the complain over once more and understand that children are not a social nuisance. By pushing child-bearing issues to the top of social agenda, we need to decline the number of the people who think the complain are acceptable and to form a society filled with hope."
NBE02359,"When I read this article, I felt that modern society has lost tolerance, so I felt disappointed. Everyone was a child and everyone has experience that plays outside and speaks in a loud voice. In spite of this, as they become adults, so they lose their memories of childhood. That there are many adults are uncomfortable with the noise of children is real. I think society like this accelerate more and more aging society with fewer children. Because young people loses the feeling that wants to give birth to and bring up children. Therefore if we can remember our childhood just a little bit, the noise of children may not become a social problem like this. To continue Japanese society we should have tolerance and it is necessary to make the environment people easy to bring up children."
NBE02582,"First, I'm surprised at the expression of ""noise"". I have never thought the sound children make outside noisy, so I have never call it noise. And it is unbelievable that people complain over it just because they aren't used to it. In my opinion, children are precious for all Japanese people, facing aging society, so we should be more tolerant toward their voice and sound."
NBE02608,"Reading this article, I felt that Japanese people have become to lose their tempers easily not only for the noise of children. For example, on the jam packed train, some people get angry for others' hand touching his body with strong. Moreover, other people get angry even for bumping others on the street. As for the noise of children, they get more angry than usual. As the article says, one of the reasons for these situations is the law birthrate. It seems to me that this problem is one of the most important problems that Japan has to solve as early as possible. The law birthrate means the small labor force in the future. As a result, Japan will get less revenue than now, and be obliged to reduce the scale of market. To solve this problem, we should promote the nation's welfare, especially child welfare. Concretely, we should increase the number of nursery schools and admit the childcare leave. Furthermore, to allow children to play to their hearts' contents, each of us should overlook the noise of children."
NBE01474,"Compared with other noises, it is easy to make a complaint to the noise of children. I think it is necessary to generate the atmosphere that we should cherish the children foe an investment for the future . So, I want the justice to rule in favor of children."
NBE01614,"When I read this article, I was surprised by the intolerance of the complainer. When I was a elementary school student, there were a lot of places to play outside and I played a lot. Maybe, my and my friend's voice were noisy, but I hadn't be scolded for the noisy. Furthermore, we were praised that 'You are cheerful. Children should be so. ' These days, people became selfish I feel in my everyday life. We should be more tolerant to the other and have more patience."
NBE02432,"I think those opinions in the article are kind of extreme arguments. I don't think low birthrate and feeling of young people that they don't want to have a child are caused by only this noise problem. Although the number of waiting children for day care centers became zero in Yokohama these days, it is not enough yet in Japan. The number of childcare workers and public facilities like parks are also not enough. The social system that women can feel easy to work hasn't be established yet. Therefore, I think it's not Just about intolerances and just saying children are not social nuisance won't solve the condition. Tough I understand that people who can't tolerate noises and sue are not ordinary and normal, and that it is natural for children to make din, of course. To tell the truth, I can also agree with their feelings, I can't help to be irritated if I always have to hear the din. I think where the day care center is opened is clue to solve the problem. In my living city, elementary school and kindergarten are next-door and house are away from there. I know, in sprawling city it is difficult to do. . . . To sum up, it is so complicated that I can't say high-sounding ideas like we should tolerate for the future!"
NBE02433,not bit but din or noise
NBE02685,"In Japan , the number of children is decreasing yearly. That is why people tend not to bear the noise of children. But, it is wrong that being intolerance about the noise of children. Because all the people used to be children and make a noise. In spite of this fact , complaining over the noise of children is somewhat strange. To solve this problem , the way to co-exist between children and the others should be thought."
NBE02632,"I can understand children's feeling to play outside and make some noise because I used to be like them and do like them. Every adults was a child and they shouted more than children who live now. I cannot understand why they complain children. As Japan's population declines, we should be kind to children and their parents. If more people don't want to have their kids, Japan would become weaker."
NBE02477,"I think that noisy children is better than quiet children. Of course, romp is not good. Children can become noisy because they are healthy and obedient. If too pay attention to others when childhood, will save a stress. Anyway, parents have to pay attention to neighbors for good relations of neighbors. It should be happening never that children are accused."
NBE02011,I think why the noise of children attracts somebody's attentions now. I want to question how was the old days! I think nothing can be done about it. Children are such creatures as making a noise. It is a process in which all people has passed. We should endure it more. Because children set a limit to play outside. I think the government should make the society more livable for children. And then population that children aged between 0 and 14 years old will increase.
NBE01449,"It is common that the children are noisy. I think most children cannot sit still for a long time. It is also common that many people dislike noise of children. I like children and I cannot understand people who dislike children, but they are not ill-natured. I hope that all people come to understand children."
NBE02060,"The place I'm living has many children, so we can hear voice of children playing and baby's crying voice. Those sound let me be warm feeling and make my smile. Neighbor's baby is so cute and kids are so funny, so I like this place. When I was elementary school student, I was a member of the club of baseball, so I played baseball every weekend and I played in the park with my friends. We run in the park, throw the ball, ride on a swing and climb a tree. There are my cherished memory. I learned ""what is friendship"" by playing with my friends. But now, many park ban ball playing, and we have few place to play baseball or football. Where can children play? A decade ago, children can play on the road, and they had a conversation with neighbors. At the time, people helped each other, and town was peace. By contrast, we don't greet with neighbors. I think it is not just a problem between children and neighborhood, it is serious issue of society as a whole. Old man in Japan increase future, many aged person need assistance, so we have to help to each other in the neighborhood. And I want to ask the person who complaining to children's voice sounds, when you will be old, who help you? It is a young man isn't it? They are kids now, so we have to make a environment that is easy to child rearing."
NBE02553,I think that everyone knows and understands that children make noise. But this noise is like the evidence that they live and it is no use complaining. So I am very surprised at the content of this article. The people who are complaining about this forget to be brought freely with making noise and be watched by adults who didn't feel angry or stress. They should recall their childhood and tolerate.
NBE02407,"I was surprised when I read this article. I do understand why people complain about the noise of kids but I think they should be a little bit more tolerant. Kids make noise by nature and they learn a lot of things by playing outside cheerfully. I think most of the people have the same experiences. I agree with the statement ""As society has fewer and fewer children, people get less used to hearing them. It's a vicious circle. "" I think the society is making the situation worse. If there will be less children, there will be less taxpayers in the future. We need to take this problem seriously to make our future better."
NBE02239,"I think that low birthrate and longevity are a problem which must be solved. However, they are not easy problems. It is necessary to fight against this problem not only by the party concerned but by a society as a whole. Japan is not in the environment which child-rearing tends to carry out. I am anxious about the future of Japan as at now. I think that low birthrate and longevity are the subject assigned to us."
NBE01907,"I was very surprised that declining birth rate causes such a problem. I like children. However, I can understand people's complaints that children are too noisy because they have high-pitched voices and talk loudly. But most people can satisfy about it because children cannot help making noise. I think that this problem is caused by people being narrow-minded in recent years."
NBE01834,"I like a child. Children are noisy. However, I think that such a portion also has loveliness. They must also have had the same time. The residents of the area should have attachment to nearby children. Then, the children should help you in the future."
NBE01313,"It is unbelievable that people in Japan complain of noise children make. It is true that that noise make people uncomfortable. But people in the world absolutely experience childhood. At that time, we all did trouble. In spite of this, complaining about children is wrong. We should see them with warm eyes."
NBE01521,"When I read this article, I was surprised and I think that there is no help for it that children are noisy. We should be gentle for the noise of the children more. When I was a elementary school student, there were a lot of places to play outside and I played a lot. Maybe, our voice were noisy, but I had not be scolded for the noisy. These days, people became selfish I feel in my everyday life. We should be more tolerant to the other and have more patience."
NBE01497,"After I read this article, I understood the reasons of decreasing birthrate are not simple. The reasons which I had known are only women's advances into society and a tendency to marry later, but this article taught me a society getting less accustomed to hearing intolerance of children. But it is natural that the voices of children are noisy and I can admit them because children are so cute. So I think the recent people become not to think children are cute. But it is difficult to make others think children are cute. I think the solution of this problem is making a lot of chances to play with children when we are young for example junior high school student goes to a kindergarten or a nursery school as a class. Actually I went to the near nursery school as a class, of course children are so noisy , but moreover children are cute. I think what we make such a chance makes people like and want children."
NBE01234,"I think it is natural that children always cry out, because their job is to play and to be scalded. They don't know something, so if people scold, they can know something. In Japan, people are aging. people perhaps think ""what is bad?"" But it is very bad! For example if old people increase, who make buildings?, who rescue?, who save a town? So, people should make baby for Japan."
NBE02336,"I think it is natural thing that children are noisy and restless, but I agree about the feeling of people who complains over the noise of children. When I studying restaurant or cafe, I am irritated at children who are running around the shop. Birth rate in Japan is decreasing year by year, so we get less used to hearing children noise. Then, we are unused to children's noise and feel annoying to that. So that the basis of the problem is Japanese declining birth rate. We need to think more seriously about that problem and find the way to solve that problem."
NBE01415,"I think we should involved in making a good environment in which people are tolerant to the noise of children. I have two reasons for this. First, what we can do to cope with the problem which article says is to change the way of peoples' thinking, because it is impossible to ask children not to make any noise . Children are immature and being silent is really hard for them, so when when we tackle this problem , it is not children but adult that should change. Second, we should prevent trouble that intolerance of noise of children results in vicious circle. In Japan the birthrate are getting lower, so we have to take action for this by making people tolerant to the noise. Because of these two reasons, I think people should change their mind and try to make the environment which is good for education."
NBE01638,"I think It is natural that children make noise, however noises made by children sometimes make problems. Talking about myself, I used to irritated by the noise made by a small boy next my house. He often shouts and cry. As a result, my neighbor told his parents to make him calm. Considering these problems, children's noise can be problem."
NBE02184,"I sometimes feel that children's voice is noisy. However , We have to accept it. By accepting it, children will grow up freely. It is unavoidable to stop decreasing population so we have to increase the number of children. In order to do so, we should make the environment where children play freely."
NBE01639,"I think It is natural that children make noise, however noises made by children sometimes make problems. Talking about myself, I used to irritated by the noise made by a small boy next my house. He often shouts and cry. As a result, my neighbor told his parents to make him calm. Considering these problems, children's noise can be problem."
NBE02164,It is natural that children and old people in a same society. And you cannot reject children. Cannot reject the natural phenomenon that children make noise. Now Japan is facing super aging society. We must coexistence with all age people. And it is fact that we should make environment that aging people comfortably living to.
NBE01810,"I think the noise of children is natural and we have to tolerate it. Then, we should not take it as a noise but as a part of live. We all made noise when we were children. But now, people who don't be accustomed to hearing it complain about the noise. Although they also didn't play completely silence. Government should inform people of the problem of declining birthrate more. If people understand the importance of children, they will make efforts to protect them and make atmosphere which they grow up healthy."
NBE02036,"I think it's big issue when I read the article. There are two points. First, birth rate. Recently, Japanese birthrate has been decreasing and the number of children is more uncommon than before. so, the noise of children can be more irritate people. Second, education problem A large number of mother have to do all things about their children by social system. So, in many cases fathers should work on day time and only mother should look after their children. I think we should solve these problem. For example, we make many space for children and mother etc. ."
NBE02787,"I was shocked very much that the percentage of children aged between 0 and 14 years old in Japan is the lowest in the world and less than half the global average of 26.8%. It is a very serious problem. Of course, I understand people who complain about noises, but children's noise is unavoidable. I expect all the people in Japan grasp the seriousness of the declining birthrate in Japan and accept children's noises."
NBE01746,"I agree that the situation in Japan prevents the birthrate from rising. Of course, I feel irritated when hearing too noisy yelling of children at night, but in the daylight the noises of children seem quite natural ones. People should be more tolerant indeed. But what should be improved is not only the tolerance of the people. Compared to other countries, such as the U. S, the child care systems seem not very good. We all should become more tolerant, and change the social systems as well."
NBE02118,"I agree with ID13019. I lived near a nursery school, and that school had a sports day. Having a sports day is good, but every year, the sports day was the same weekend when I had tests. The sound from speaker and noise children made irritated me. However, when I was a child, the sound that my school made in a sports day irritated people near the school. I think ID13019's suggestion is effective."
NBE02119,"I disagree with ID13018 because she only referred to the parents' responsibility. Of course, discipline is necessary. However, only disciplining prevent children from growing. Instead of accusing parents and children, we should be tolerant."
NBE01677,"I disagree with your opinion because he thinks that there is nothing we can do about making noise by children . I think that if parents discipline children, children understand it is not good to make noise in public."
NBE01728,"I agree with ID13042's opinion. I also think children are vigor and noisy, and they aren't social nuisance. Unless they act as they want, our lives lose power to live. So adults should have wider heart to tolerate them. And to make the world nearer to children's lives, the idea that the housings nearby should or day care center must be reduced the price sounds nice to me."
NBE02218,"I would agree with ID13061's opinion. What Maeda and Hosaka said in the text makes sense. Though it is true that we should be tolerant of the noise that children make, they ARE still noisy and sometimes annoy us."
NBE02718,"I agree with ID13052. Everyone makes noise when they are children. So, I also think it is unfair to take children to task for their noise. Today, their many people who always look after their own interests. Complains of those people will accelerate the decline of the number of children and birthrate. So, I think the noise children make should be allowed and people should have a broad mind too."
NBE02092,"I think it's natural for kid to run around and make noises. Are children these days really getting more noisier and have bad manners than before?I don't think so. The reason why many people came to think them annoying is that the environment has changed. In this technological century, people became lonely and come to live by themselves. Communities are shrinking smaller and smaller and many of them are collapsing. What we have to do is not to shut those kids' mouth but to improve the education environment and make a child friendly society. Tolerate and considerate society will benefit not only the kids and parents but also the whole members of the society, I think."
NBE02093,I agree to your opinion. The environment is what we have to think of. It is obvious that children can't think more than adults. We should think more and be tolerate for children and for ourselves in this aging society. Considerate mind and action against children will make the society more comfortable and last long term.
NBE02559,"I agree with your idea that we should accept the noise of the children and make good environment for them. Surely, in Japan the number of children are decreasing now. So we should stand their noise and bring up them by surrounding people. We should have tolerance heart."
NBE02412,I agree with his idea. We all know everyone used to be children and make some noises. So people should be more tolerant with the noise of children. And I think it is very good idea that we need to think about the way to co-exist between children and the others.
NBE01477,"I agree with you. Everyone was taken care of in society at the time of the child. Although this, one think child is annoying after growth to adult. I think this is very selfish. And children will shoulder the future destiny of our country. I think that we should become tolerant."
NBE01240,"I always played TV game at home, I was very quiet, because I was very hard to play it! My mother also say ""Play at the park!"" I say ""YES"" But I go to my friend house, because I can eat a lot of cake!"
NBE01394,"I agree with you. Children should make a noise, that is natural. The only thing we need to teach to children is ""You should be filled with curiosity many thing around you. "" instead of ""Do not make a noise everywhere!"""
NBE01395,"I agree with the idea of Kinuko Inoguchi. We have to set forward child-bearing issues. The social agenda is that to make people think that curious children are needed for our future. I would like parents and adults to @@notice that it is not good for young children to be forced not to make noises. Children should have curiosity everything, make a noise, and be blown away a lot of things."
NBE01454,"I agree with her. Most of people have the same experiences when they were children, so they should be lenient with them. Children will become leaders in the future."
NBE01790,"I agree with ID13010's opinion. It is natural that children make noise. We should not get angry at it, because children learn various things in play. We should watch them warmly"
NBE01960,"I agree with ID13035's opinion. I think modern children don't change comparing with old one's. I think what change is environment. Now, communities are collapsed. People are alone. So people don't tolerant people. I feel sad about this news."
NBE01420,"I'm agree with your opinion that people should watch children warmly, because it is impossible for children to make no noise. So we should understand children and tolerate their noise."
NBE01644,"I disagree with her. I know that it is natural for children to make noise. However, sometimes the noise make the neighbor irritated. Children do not know that their noise cause problems, so their parents ought to talk them not to make too much noise."
NBE01901,"I was shocked by this article first. Children shouldn't be noisy? BUt after reflection, I noticed Japan's society is changing little by little. This society is aging little by little. Like old days play by lots of children should be cared not to disturb the lives of elderly people."
NBE01288,"Once people complains over the child noise, parents may wither. If Japanese birth rate declines thanks to this, it's too late. Surely people are tend to be under stress, but it cannot be a reason to complain about noisy children. As long as the connection with local community disappears, we must care about what we do or say."
NBE01594,I can understand the claim that children are noisy. Sometimes I feel so when I stay at home. But we must tolerate such feeling. Children consists of foundation of a country. We have to educate them freely.
NBE02317,"I would like to complain to these complainers. For sure, parents should always keep their eyes on their children and be considerate toward other people. However, it is very natural for children to make noise and all of us used to do it in our own childhood. With the widespread use of compute, children have less chance to play outside today. Playing loudly is absolutely needed for children to grow up soundly. Considering today's aging society and Japan's future, adults should be a little more tolerant toward noisy children."
NBE01963,"I think modern children don't change comparing with old one's. I think what change is environment. Now, communities are collapsed. People are alone. So people don't tolerant people. I feel sad about this news. When I was a child, around people tolerant toward me and once in a while I was scold. So I was raised by not only my parents but also people around me. I hope people around children get tolerant toward children and children should be raised local people."
NBE01278,I think Japanese have to have patience with noise that children make. Because making noise is good and important thing for children. So it is necessary for children to make noise. So Adult have to put up with noise that children make.
NBE02340,"I agree with your idea. I also think children are vigor and noisy, but they aren't social nuisance. And your idea which adults should have wider heart to tolerate childrens is totally same as me!!"
NBE02535,I was so shocked to know more and more people are complaining about the noise of children because it is natural that they make some noise when playing outside. The saddest thing is that some Japanese aren't afford to permit the noise of the child.
NBE02192,"I agree with your opinion. We should accept and patient the children's noises. Everyone was child, so we (adults) should watch stare children."
NBE01878,"I feel uncomfortable because of noise children make many times. However, I understand making noise by children , so I can allow it and I want everyone to forgive these noises."
NBE01771,"The situation surrounding the birth rate is harsh indeed. Society seems less accustomed to children. But the faults lie in the parents as well. Many of them seem to take it for granted to be treated specially, and children and parents with no common sense are increasing. Both society and parents have to compromise each other, otherwise this problem has no solution."
NBE05067,I think so serious the situation. Our social member decrease so our burden is more. The problem is so hard. We should solve the problem
NBE02892,"True I think the noise children make is big and the noise sometime makes people uncomfortable. But I think the noise should not be eliminated. it's because obviously it's impossible and if possible, it unable children to play, run, sing, etc, freely: children cannot have freedom. Also according to this article, since the number of children is decreasing those who feel the noise uncomfortable they make. If there were a campaign that children's noise is eliminated, the number of parents who want to have children would be decreasing. To prevent "" negative chain"", Japanese government have to enforce a law which gives parents hope to have children."
NBE02891,"According to this article, the more number of children decrease, the more number of people can't stand noise which children make. When I live in my parents' home, my family and I were disgusted' about noise which a child lived in the upper floor made, but now I think we didn't get used to children's noise as this article says. Of course, parents who have children take care about excessive noise, but nobody can't stop children play freely. Children should enjoy their playing and we should have mind accepting children. If we don't have sympathy each other, the number of children decrease rapidly. We have to think this problem seriously."
NBE02893,"When I read this article, I was surprised because I didn't think so much people couldn't put up with the noise children made. It may be true that such noise is very annoying for some people, however, I think we have to considerate for other people around us. Also, declining of the number of children is getting severe problem recently. Therefore, we all understand the matter and to do actions we can do to solve the problem. As for women, I think it is very good that the government gives them financial support because I hear many women concerns about not having enough money."
NBE02894,"When I read this article, I was surprised because I don't think children's noise make me annoying. There voice are very cheerful and symbol of peace Japan."
NBE07049,"I felt sad to read this news. When I was a child, adults didn't complain about the noise of us. I want adults to remember time when they were children. Probably, adults would not complain when present adults were children either. Aging society is one of the most serious problems of Japan. So, I think that it is necessary to keep the environment where children can play freely."
NBE05227,"I was surprised to hear the bad news. I think the voice of children is not a nuisance. On the contrary, I am refreshed by that. When was a high school student, I lived near a park. I always heard the lively voice when I was studying. It didn't irritate me at the time. All people had a term to go outside and play with a loud voice. Thus, we should not complain about that. I hope that people in Japan become more tolerant about children."
NBE07213,"If one resource lean one side, the other side become harmful to the opposite side, and both sides go bad. I hope more and more people notice this nonsense, and tackle this matter in cooperation."
NBE05226,I agree with you. All children have a right to play freely. Adults should not complain about that only because they are noisy. They have to receive it because the noise of children is natural thing. They should notice that they also played freely in their childhood. I hope all people to be tolerant and comfortable about the noise.
NBE06877,"I was very sad to read this article. To tell the truth, I am sometimes repugnant to the noise of children, but each time I reflect on it. When I was a small, I was supposed to be very noisy. All the people are noisy, too. Therefore, we should stand the noise of children to some extent. Children must be raised by each region."
NBE05424,"I agreed with your thought. I wonder why some people complain children's voice . it cannot be said that children voice is not loud, but children is normally loud , and we might be loud in daily life. So people must be more acceptable and look children warmly."
NBE06092,"When I read this article, I felt that adults should act like adults especially in front of children. People who are now complaining about the children's noise also used to be children, and I believe that they use to make noise when they played outside in their childhoods. These complaints would also affect other adult's motivation to make kids, which leads to the low birthrate and longevity society in Japan right now. I think people should be become tolerant about children's behavior to create a better society which children can grow up freely. I really hope these situation improves by the time when I become a parent."
NBE07156,"When I saw the title of this article, I could understand it. I was sometime uncomfortable with noisy children simply because I couldn't compose myself in that situation. Of course, children are active and I was noisy in a childhood. However, it doesn't mean they may do everything what they want to do. The role to teach it is their parents. I think this news can read the undereducation of the parent from this thing, too. I have been taught from my parents, so I followed that I must not do it not to do it. It's important for a parent to make the place where you may be upset about a child and a bad place certain and tell. For a parent to copy a child again, there is also a possibility that a pro-self body can't do the distinction. Therefore an adult should also be careful of itself."
NBE01544,"When I read this article, I was surprised to know the fact that the measures taken in Abenomics is not always good for people. The influence of cheap yen is one good example. Therefore I want current government to act carefully when doing economical measures. Also I want it to think carefully about the change of the current constitution. Anyway, through this news, I felt that I people should see things from various perspectives. From now on, before I do actions, I want to reconsider about them carefully."
NBE01672,"I cannot understand this article at all because I do not know ""Abenomics"" at all. What only things I know ""Abenomics"" are ""a financial policy"" and ""monetary policy"" and ""a growth strategy"". No clear picture about it comes to mind. But judging from the news, I think that business activity has gradually gotten better than at least before."
NBE02266,"Shamefully, I hardly know ""Abenomics"", so I investigate that system and effect on the Internet. In my opinion, ""Abenomics"" will probably fail. The key point of the Abenomics is The Trans-Pacific Partnership ""TPP"", which is one of the most ambitious free trade agreements ever attempted. It is a proposed free trade deal currently being negotiated between 11 countries. These are Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, United States, Singapore and Vietnam. It is expected to boost investment flows between the countries and further boost their economic growth. But, the products made in Japan are expensive in the world. No matter how larger the market becomes, high-priced goods remain hard sells. Eventually, the profit of the TPP will revert to the other country."
NBE01984,"I think 'Abenomics' is good plan. Of course the price of every things is rising. However, in the long run, salaries of people will be raising by companies. People should wait for good results from long term point of view. It is because people wanted good results so early by now. Japanese people should have patience. In addition, only aiming for sensation, the mass media should not stir up worries of people."
NBE02763,"I have thought that 'Abenomics' is very wonderful policy, because I have not known about 'Abenomics' well. So I learned many things of it from this article and realized that 'Abenomics' is not always beneficial for the citizens, it also has disadvantages at the same time. In future, there will be a lot of controversy which 'abenomics' is success, or not. However, I believe that it is the right policy for us, so I'd like to support it and hope the Japanese society will recover."
NBE02738,"Before I read this article, I got a negative impression because there's no guarantee that inflation would lead the economy to recovery. There also might be a possibility of stagflation as Shukan Post (June 14) said. Now, through this article, I'm still wondering if the policy is precarious because Shukan Post points out another problem with ""Abenomics. "" It says that Japanese exporters' slightly rosier situation has failed to spread to other sectors because they haven't had a more favorable exchange rate. Of course, it is important to make drastic reforms to change the society, so it desn't mean I criticize all this policy, but there may be a necessity to think more about the problems."
NBE01416,"I was shocked to read this news. Before I read this article, I believed abenomics are good for Japan because it can help us to recover from deflation. But after reading this article, I was shocked to hear that abenomics can lead to stagflation. If this article is true, abenomics is not good for Japanese economics at all. I think we should discuss the abenomics and find solution for these problems."
NBE01696,"It's really difficult to study economics, and I don't know about it very much, it's so complicating. Therefore, I can't judge whether Abenomics is good for economy in Japan or not, but it seems a problem to rise not salaries but prices, which must hit us all. However, nobody knows what will happen in the future because of Abenomics, and I think it better thing to change something in any situation. It's natural to have both good and bad side in changing something, so It needs some bravery, and many people tend to want not to take a risk. Thus, in my opinion instituting Abenomics is better than conducting nothing. It has a chance to make our economy revival because nothing will happen unless we do something."
NBE02114,"I sometimes watch news of ""Abenomics. "" In that news, some people say "" Business is improving"", but other people say "" I don't think business is improving. "" I don't know ""Abenomics"" well, but the rise in prices of everything is big problem for me. I started living apart from my family from this April, and I came to care the prices. I try to buy cheaper daily necessities, so a price rise bothers me. I hope the consumption tax won't rise."
NBE02140,"I did not understand all about ""Abenomics"". But, I think it may be a mere facade that the media makes. The stock price and yen's worth true rose, but they were only temporary. Now, many problems happen. So, we must understand a fault of ""Abenomics"" and we need to think how to develop the economy in Japan."
NBE02503,"I found it so difficult to understand what this article said. I don't agree with ""Abenomics"". This policy looks like the biggest gamble of Japan, in my opinion. This policy is carried out by Shinzo Abe in order to climb out of its deflation. The important part of this policy is Trans-Pacific Partnership ""TPP"". As he announced that Japan virtually took part in TPP, all goods became a target of negotiation. In short, it depends on negotiation whether TPP will power its economy or not. In fact, this policy is leading Japan in good direction so far, but there is no guarantee that things will go as planned. If this policy turns out to be a failure, this policy will cause stagflation which is called the worst economy. So we should think about this policy carefully."
NBE01932,"I think ""Abenomics"" to be effective. When ""Abenomics"" fails, economy is confused, but the economy declines when we do not take action. Japan becomes surely like Greece if we do nothing. Unlike conventional three years, I thank for having taken action. Strong stimulation is necessary for the present economy of Japan."
NBE01640,"The writer of this article casts doubt on ""Abenomics"". However, I do not think Abenomics have negative affects on our daily life. Since rising commodity prices means wage increase, and furthermore, low yen is good for export. As you know, we have little resources in Japan so we have to get foreign currency by exporting. All Abe doing things make Japanese economy pick up, I'm sure."
NBE02714,"I am not familiar with economy. But when I hear the news, I think there is a gap between the government of Japan and the Japanese people. In other words, wealth people and people who make money on the stock market can really feel the effect of ""Abenomics"" , however, average people can't only feel it, but also their lives are being more and more hard. In the past, Japan went through the collapse of the bubble economy. So I think that the consumption will decrease rather than rise contrary to the rise in prices for fear of the second collapse of Japanese economy . Certainly we should evaluate the action present government have done and practicing their policy, but I think the government should formulate a policy directly connected with the life of average people."
NBE02088,"Abenomics is too much a narrow-minded policy, I think. It's true that if you ease money, the money circulate more faster and the economy gets active. But that's only a theory. Abenomics relies too much on theory. It doesn't focus on the sight of individuals, from average to poor people. Thus, I think this policy won't last long."
NBE01367,"I have a doubt for ""Abenomics"". Because it is groundless, and the rise in prices has not been accompanied with the rise in wage . Actually, there are a few people who answered that he or she receive a higher salary than he or she used to and economy is good now in a man-in-the-street interview . However, I think it is sure that many people are looking for the economy to make a recovery. So, I desire that good economy cycle is born and other countries whom economy influence Japanese economy become good, too."
NBE02295,"Before reading this article, I knew the word ""Abenomics. "" The bold financial policy is thought as important. It is because there is a view of becoming an explosive of buoying up the economy if thorough money market relaxation is advanced. I think that this policy does not continue for a long time. Conversely, if there is a danger of causing the stagflation which is in the worst situation, I regard."
NBE01908,"When I read this article, I was very surprised because the price of many things were increased. I didn't notice it. However, I don't think that ""Abenomics"" is just a bubble. There are some reasons. First, salaries is rising. For example, spring labor offensive in this year was succeeded. A lot of companies rise salaries. Second, consumption is increasing. Many consumers buy expensive things for mid-year gifts in this year. Finally, Japanese weekly magazines are mostly rubbish. Shukan Post is not exception, either. They only write gossip and lies. So I cannot trust this article because of quotation from Shukan Post."
NBE02012,"I thought ""Abenomics"" to be good until I read this article. However, I know an particular person may profit by it and can't have a good feeling. If a salary does not go up and the consumption tax rises, a citizen will be angry with him and his policy. The government should consider our future economy again."
NBE02583,"Abenomics goes well in theory but for the average citizen, it can be hardship. In my opinion, it's not a good policy that is dependent of only a theory. The good one is the plan that fully takes account of us, the average citizen. I think this policy will fall down before long."
NBE02686,"Next April , the consumption tax will rise to 8% from 5%. Only this situation , our lives will somewhat be hard. And the effect of ""Abenomics"" is concerned. But I do not think ""Abenomics"" affects worse our lives. Because we should evaluate it for a more longer time. And I think policy about economy , politics and so on can not be evaluated over a short span exactly."
NBE02609,"On 5.23, we had the stock market crash. Weather this happening is the fault of Abenomics is indistinct, but it surely damaged to the market. Today, the stock price is not stable. Then, why did this stock market crash happen? One of the optimistic ideas is that it was just an adjustment term. Until then, the stock prices sharply jumped, so investors sold their stocks to adjust the market. However, as a negative idea, the stock market crash meant the limit of Abenomics. Abenomics only aroused our customer interests, and it was not the structural reform. Therefore, it was bubble, and the stock market crash was the bursting of bubble and inevitable. To judge which idea is right, we should pay much attention to the economy."
NBE02384,"I think people should wait to complain about 'Abenomics' at the moment. That is because we haven't really got to see how 'Abenomics' will impact on Japanese society yet. It is true that the rises in prices of everything has been forcing hardships to people in every social rank. However, it is also true that an economic boom should be caused by inflation too. So it is possible that an economy continues to improve by sustaining 'Abenomics' and people can easily buy expensive things. We should wait to see how the Japanese society will change from now on, and then criticize it."
NBE02633,"I think ""Abenomics"" may be good to our society in the future. Now, the prices of everything from utilities to toilet paper, food to furniture, has already begun and will accelerate. The prices of everything is rising but not salaries. But the salary will rise, too. Then, ""Abenomics"" will be a good policy to us."
NBE02659,"I can't judge 'Abenomics' produces a revival or a bubble because I am not an expert of economy but a general person. Recently news frequently reports that business has been recovering, but I feel these kinds of news don't have a clear basis or proof. Of course, it is the fact that the Japanese nation uses more money to anything. On the other side, it is also the fact that salaries hasn't risen at all. Therefore we feel distressed by higher prices rather than enjoy good time of business. In addition, I claim that the low yen is not always admirable. This is because Japan cannot work out without importing many sorts of stuffs. So, it is the most important for Japan to keep the best balance of the yen value."
NBE02478,"I think that ""Abenomics"" is a makeshift. If the government help the economic, the Japanese economy can't recover. Because power of the Japanese economy is weak. The Japanese government should have different aim. It is no meaning that only economic development. We need that think about ourself happiness."
NBE02061,"Abenomics made some motion of Japan's economy. Yen moved to cheap and stock price rose up. The time of the first, media reports recovery in the economy, and revival of bonus in large companies. Everybody of course me too, thought Japan's future is bright. But eventually, media started to tell us about inflation of prices, oil, gas, flour and bread. They reported that salary is not rising in almost companies. by the way, I want to buy Macbook, but it gone up about 10, 000 yen by weak yen. I couldn't comply, I realized rising price. But I don't curse Mr. Abe, I think he does good job. Politicians until now doesn't move to rebuild Japan's economy. On the other hand Mr. Abe put into practice. I think even if something doesn't good work, it's important whether to challenge, not just say."
NBE02554,"When I read this article, I thought that the Japanese should know and be more interested in the information of the politics and the economy. Because most of the Japanese know the word of ""Abenomics"" but don't understand the meaning of this word. I can not have the actual feeling of this effects so I want this policy to success and lead the Japanese future bright."
NBE01390,"I don't know what is the best way for Japan. ""Abenomics"" is the best way ? Maybe yes, but maybe not. The price of every things rises, this situation is not so much matter for rich person, but a lot of general person should upset. . This is rapid and drastic changes of economic structures. I hope this policy affects us better. We should continue to think about this problem carefully."
NBE01787,"When I read this article, I was very shock. I was not too interested in ""Abenomics"" so far, but I believed that there is no demerit in the policy. However, a demerit written by an article occurred by""Abenomics"". I didn't know these facts at all. I reflected on not having been interested in politics so far. After all, it is bad not to know own country's detail. I want to study hard about this problem"
NBE01450,"I thought Abenomics is good policy for us, but actually I can't judge whether this policy is good. Abenomics has many sides. The price is rising, but Japanese economy is getting better. People should judge this policy carefully. However, it is clear that no action can produce no good results."
NBE01235,"Abenomics is very good opinion. Because, as a result, an economic recover. But I don't know anything. This policy is very difficult, so I can't understand. Japan will be better than any other country, and people will get a lot of wages. I want to be good by I graduate from KEIO!"
NBE01835,"I think that ""Abenomics"" is a good plan. ""Abenomics"" revived the economy of Japan which had hung low. I think that economy will get confused if ""Abenomics"" breaks. In order that a country may make ""Abenomics"" successful, I want it to be consistent. I am opposed to a rise of a consumption tax. I think that people's consumption will decrease."
NBE01569,"I think Abenomics is a bubble, as Shukan Post viewed. Of course it helps Japanese economy recover, but it is not sure that the effect will last for several years. This policy's purpose is to increase the amount of money on the market. However putting too much money at the same time may confuse the situation. Also Mr. Abe carries out deregulation and issues government bonds to activate the market, but it means that the amount of debt which we, young generation, have to pay off is increasing and our burden gets heavier and heavier. I understand that recovering from recession is very important, but the policy should be more sustainable."
NBE02240,"I also regard a Abenomics as uneasy. Business has been improving recently. However, I think that it resembles the bubble economy. But, we only have believing the Prime Minister's thing. It is hoped, as it is, business of Japan continues improving. After business improves, it is expected that the wonderful life will wait."
NBE01314,"It is fact that rising prices of goods hit our family budgets. From the this point, we will feel being poor. But , from the view of social security, if, by the whole of the society being better, government can do a better policy, we may be get real chance of being well. Government naturally have duty of persuade people. But we also have duty of believe our leader."
NBE02337,"I was really shocked about this news. This is because, I thought Abenomics has just good influence for Japanese economic. But after I read this news I realized it has not good affect like a weak yen. We already get some bad influence. Also the news which I saw in this morning said, people who recommend Abenomics are less than people who are not recommend. It means many Japanese people are afraid of Japanese new economic style and not really recommend. So that we need to know both of good and bad effect of Abenomics."
NBE02360,"I often watch the word ""Abenomics"" in newspaper and news program , but I couldn't explain the meaning of this word or get straight to the point. Economics is difficult to be predicted. If the Japanese economy is on track for recovery, it will not be able to guarantee to keep a good condition after several years, too. Therefore, I think ""Abenomics"" is not said to be effective easily. Also this article makes reference to the word of stagflation. The meaning of this word is prices have gone up in spite of salaries of people can't be raised or the number of unemployed people rises in depression. If ""Abenomics""will lead to stagflation, we will not get out ""Lost a score of years"". So that we have awareness of the issues of Japanese economy and check the movement in the government, may cause economic stability. I think we are only attracted to the charms of the word of ""Abenomics"" and believe to recover Japanese economy is danger."
NBE01498,"After I read this article, I notice the influence of "" Abenomics"" which I have not been interested. A strong yen rate may have good influence for exporting, but it will theater our daily. In fact price for example Mcdonald's raises prices not only hamburger because I guess most of material of hamburger are imported from foreign countries. It is very small influence for rich people, but one for the middle class like us are so serious. The price increase makes our life needy and our demand is decrease. As a result it makes a recession. Of course I know the higher price are good for business conditions in theory. In fact exporting are better than ever and company's profits are increase. But salary are not increase, so ""Abenomics"" make a difference between rich people and poor people broader. I think ""Abenomics"" are not bad for economy. but it will not success without increasing salary."
NBE02165,"Actually, i'm not understand about Abenomics well and economy well. But I think that a economic policy is have to reduce to every citizen, not a part of people. Now it maybe in the early stage of revival. We cannot hurry, and should to observe the circumstances."
NBE01811,"Rising price is necessary for economic recovery. Actually, this phenomenon can be seen now and it was a part of""Abenomics"" from a beginning. However, this policy has many risks. It needs the corporation of the nation. Without persuasive explanation, people can't understand policy correctly and government can't carry out the plan. If the prices continue rising and salaries don't be raised, people won't buy things. The government should encourage people to buy for economic recovery."
NBE02037,"I was surprised when I read this article because I thought Abenomics had very good effects to Japanese economics. But, it was not correct. Judging from this news, sudden weak yen or some economic action don't go far below the surface. I think if we improve our economics , we have to change fundamental system"
NBE02529,"Before I read this article, I got a positive impression because it can help our lives better. I heard that economy was restored in news recently. However, according to this news, I thought this economic recovery to have possibilities to be only a temporary thing. After Next April the consumption tax is due to rise to 8% from 5%, I am afraid whether economy in Japan does not go to the bad direction."
NBE01723,"Even though the economy tend to good direction, I can't call it succeed unless we feel ourselves wealthy. Off course, the increasing prices and taxes may revitalize the economy. But if our income doesn't increase, we only suffer from the rising. So I think president Abe should take action to better income for workers before raising prices . However, I feel he want to regain the wealth of bubble generation. As for me and the generation which doesn't know the bubble, it is so interesting revolution. So I don't want him to give up."
NBE02271,"I don't agree with naoeID13018's opinion that business activity has gradually gotten better than at least before. According to the newspaper, the key point of ""Abenomics"" is TPP. It seems to raise investment flows between the countries and further improve their economic growth, indeed, but the products made in Japan are expensive in the world. No matter how larger the market becomes, high-priced goods remain hard sells. Eventually, the profit of the TPP will revert to the other country."
NBE02410,"To be honest, I hardly knew about ""Abenomics"" before I read this article. I had thought it brings us a lot of good influences. But now I know it doesn't give us only good effects. And I understood why the prices of many things has gone up recently. Rising the price such as ""A McDonald's 100-yen Mac is now 120 yen"" is not a big deal for rich people, but for people who are not rich this would be a big effects. I know it is very difficult to control the economics and give good effects to everyone but I hope this situation will get better."
NBE02365,"I don't agree with your opinion. Because I think people's salary will rise that can't say. And economics is difficult to be predicted. If ""Abenomics""will continue by Prime Minister Abe after several years, it will not say that can guarantee to keep a good condition. So I hope ""Abenomics"" will have a good effect on Japanese economy, but ""Abenomics"" is not said to be effective yet."
NBE01239,"If the consumption tax rise from 5% to 8%, I will be damaged. For example, if we buy something at average 100 yen shop, I have to pay 108 yen. If we buy ""Umaibo"", we have to pay 11 yen. Its sales will be down!"
NBE02637,"I don't agree with your idea. You said 'abenomics is not good for Japanese economics at all' , but now some change is happening in the industrial world. Some big companies raised salary and gave bonus. This is clearly good for Japanese economy."
NBE01522,"I think 'Abenomics' is very good plan. The price of everythings is rising, but salaries of people will be raising by companies. People should wait for good results from long term point of view. Because people wanted good results so early by now. Japanese people should have patience. In addition, only aiming for sensation, the mass media should not stir up worries of people. And we should pay much attention to the economy."
NBE01574,"I agree with ID13006's take. I think only investors and big trading company have made profits and ordinary people cannot find any benefits of Abenomics. If Mr. Abe's ""groundless"" policies met with failure, it would take much time to recover Japanese economy."
NBE01260,I think that rising in prices of everything is necessary for Japan. But I don't want Abe to rise in prices of everything . Because the tax that I pay now is only consumption. So rising consumption is big problem for me.
NBE01317,"I can't agree with your opinion. It is fact that Abenomics make tax rise. But this will make good affection to our life. For example, employment rate will rise by spread money. So we have to stand high taxes."
NBE02483,"I agree with your comment. I think so that ""Abenomics"" are not bad for economy, but it's stopgap measure. If the ground of Japanese economy strong, we can say ""Abenomics"" succeed in recovering Japanese economy."
NBE01937,"I agree with your opinion. I think the government cannot completely save economy now ""Abenomics"". It is not only"" Abenomics"", and a different policy is necessary for Japan. we should think about""what is the most important""."
NBE01287,"There are many opinions about the Abenomics. Some say it endangers Japan's agriculture, others say like the articles. But the deflation that has been for 20 years itself is clearly bad situation. The Abenomics actually changes the situation. If it gives us bad effects, then we think about it. As Japanese government has taken no actions (as a result, the deflation continued), we shouldn't oppose the new actions without effective solution."
NBE01887,"I agree with Abenomics. Of course prices are staying high but in the future, salaries will be raised and consumer will be more active. People should expect for this profit."
NBE01595,"Before I read this article, I thought that Abenomics is very marvelous policy and includes no risk. But it becames to be wrong. Actually it may contains some risk, but I hope it will success and Japanese economy will revive."
NBE01962,I thought ABENOMICS is only a good policy. But this article said ABENOMICS have dangerous sides. People tend to support a sort term success. We should see a long term about ABENOMICS.
NBE01290,"I almost agree with your opinion. Japanese prime minister Abe is getting Japanese economy recovered , but, on the other hand, he encourages public works. The Government shouldn't provide a cover for public works by the Abenomics."
NBE01752,"I think the rapid changes in these days is scaring. In fact, I haven't got any jobs and paid my own living so far, and it is hard for me to realize the actual changes in economy directly, but compared to history, and considering the economical situation of past few years, the change seems too rapid. We cannot conclude whether the economic policy is right only from predictions, but if this is bubble economy, I'm pretty scared of the time for me to get a job."
NBE02613,"I agree with you. Abenomics depends on the theory, so it discords with the real economy. Moreover, the blessing that Abenomics gives us is only for the rich. For example, investors get big money from high stock prices, while the poor does not have enough money to invest, so they cannot share the blessing. To make Japanese economy more stable and extensive, Abenomics has to make allowance for not only the rich, but the poor."
NBE01479,"Abenomics has the risk, but it will be effective economic policy for the time being. Growth strategy after this is really important."
NBE01480,"I disagree you. Abenomics has the risk, but it will be effective economic policy for the time being."
NBE02341,I disagree with your idea. This is because I don't think Abenomics' is not good plan. This is because price of every things are rising is harmful for poor people. I think one of the important recent problem of Japanese government is poor people cannot rise to the normal. So that Abenomics' is not good plan for Japan.
NBE02189,Abenomics has positive points and negative points. Policies of economy often have risks. But it is better to carry out policies than not to carry out anything. Sooner or later the result of Abenomics will be clear.
NBE01345,"Abenomics is a Abe's political strategy. It's a plan to recover Japanese finance. Actually, almost of Japanese citizens expect it. Now, Not only a big company but also a lot of small businesses support Japanese economy. So I think ""Abenomics"" should have a good effect to them. Unless do it, ""Abenomics"" won't success"
NBE02440,"I think Abenomics improve economic. But the products made in Japan are expensive overseas. And I have heard the prices are raised by yen rate changing. I also think Abenomics is not always good for people. Big company receives benefit but ordinary people don't receive it yet. Actually, I can't feel any benefit in my daily life. I hope Abenomics lasts long stably and happily for all, not only the rich but also the poor."
NBE02791,"In order to make Japan better, economic policies are essential. Of course a weak yen is not the only good thing, but any economic policy has ambiguity. Abenomics has 3 course of action. To make economic policy successful is probably difficult, but I expect Mr. Abe will do well in the long term. Japan's Prime Minister always change soon, but political success need long time. Therefore, I want Mr. Abe to do carefully over a long time."
NBE02651,"I disagree with your idea. You said 'abenomics is not good for Japanese economics at all' , but now some change is happening in the industrial world. Some big companies raised salary and gave bonus. This is clearly good for Japanese economy."
NBE01862,"I cannot understand at all because I do not know well about abenomics but I think abenomics is a good plan because the price of everythings is rising, I will study more about abenomics from now."
NBE01630,"I still think the Abenomics will have good impact on our lives in the long run. The rising of the price of everyday stuff sounds bad first but in the long run, it means high wages and more consumption. So Japanese economy will recover I'm sure."
NBE01770,"I think Abenomics has produced a economic bubble. The definition of economic bubble is ""trade in high volumes at prices that are considerably at variance with intrinsic values. ""This applies to the economic in these days. But the media reports the positive dimension alone, and we can say we are deceived by them and the government. Thus it is difficult for us to grasp the real situation only from the information provided, and we have to learn to acquire what is called media literacy."
NBE02895,"About half a month have passed since the government raise the consumption tax from 5% to 8%. 3% appears to be tiny and the increase in tax revenue will benefit the government, but I think it would do harm than good for Japanese economy. According to the article, an across-the-board price is increasing and the rise is what ""Abenomics"" was delighted in order to conquer deflation. However, just because Price have gone up (or the economy was stimulated), it doesn't mean that the wage standard rises immediately. Even if companies receive the benefit of Abenomics, many of them would save the money as internal reserves in order to prepare for the next recession. So, the majority of people would suffer from high prices. Given the situation, the raising of the consumption tax would make us anxious about our daily expenses. In conclusion, I think the negative side of Abenomics will stand out in the long run."
NBE02896,"I think this kind of opinion is not correct. Shall we discuss the exchange rate between Japanese yen and US dollar? Before the financial crisis in 2008(Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers), It was at one hundred yen to the dollar. After 2008, It has become at eighty yen to it. 2013 Mr Abe came back to the power and Abenomics started. The exchange rate changed rapidly and now, the rate is at one hundred yen. We just returned to 2008. I cannot imagine some people call this economical situation an inflation or something worse."
NBE01545,"What I think is most important for doing presentations in English is that listeners can understand the contents without any efforts. We should not care small grammatical mistakes, but we should explain general points of the contents to the listeners. To do so, we have to speak slowly and clearly and speak with loud voice, of course in easy English. Also, eye-contact must be done in order to impress the listeners. And I thought it is interesting to offer quizzes or movies or pictures in presentations in order not to bore listeners."
NBE02115,"Doing presentation in Japanese is difficult for me. Of course, doing presentation in English was so difficult that I couldn't do that well. To do a good presentation, first, I think the words used in the script should be easy to understand. My script contained some difficult words and phrases. Such words or phrases bother the listeners. Second, presenter should make good eye contact. Only reading the script makes the listener bored. Third, good slides and clear main point are needed. Good slides attract the interest of listener and clear main point help understand the news. Next time, I want to do presentation better."
NBE01985,"I think eye contact and clear voice is important for doing good presentation. It is because eye contact is needed to see whether people understand or not. And, I can make themselves understood by clear voice. What is more, good slide is also needed to help people understand. That is all."
NBE02267,"I learned two things for doing a good presentation in English through the last class. First, I learned that memorizing the manuscript is important to make a speech without any trouble at all. In fact, the speech of Akiya and Mayu, who memorized their own manuscript were easy to hear. Second, I find the influence of the figures and the pictures. No matter how we make a good manuscript, the words lose the figures and the pictures in the impact. Expressing the main points in figures or pictures is important for a good presentation."
NBE02479,"Important things of doing presentation is careful preparation and playing it by ear. If prepare carefully the presentation, we can doing presentation to relax. Besides if see audience, one can play it by ear in the presentation, the presentation become perfect. Preparation of my presentation in the last class was not perfect. So, I got into a panic. But I could play it by ear, finally Mr. Marchand smiled."
NBE01673,"What I think the important for doing a good presentation in English is doing eye contact with listeners regularly. I think that we have good communication by doing eye contact. And, by doing so, a presenter see whether listeners can understand or not. I think that eye contact is the most important for doing a good presentation in English."
NBE01570,"I learned that a presenter need lead and help a listener join the presentation and I think the following two ways are important to make a good presentation. The first way is asking questions during the presentation. This way is very good because both a presenter and listeners join and make a presentation together. All the students I listened to did ask some questions to draw out my reaction. Thanks to them, I enjoyed the news stories without feeling bored. Asking questions makes listeners think about the topic more deeply and react to the presentation. The second way is eye contact. At first, I was too nervous to look at my listener, but it seemed to make her a little uneasy. Then I tried to make eye contact to see her reaction. As a result, she appeared to be relieved and understood the contents better. Moreover, I got comfortable to speak to her. I realized that making eye contact is very important for both a presenter and listeners."
NBE02062,"If we want to teach something by presentation, we have to use easy words and speak slowly and clearly. When I watched TED, nobody speak while looking their script. They are not just say something, they tell and listen audience's reaction, sometimes they ask a question to the listener. They communicate with audience. In contrast, sometimes I read my script, and spoke unclearly. I just spoke one-sidedly, so I can't tell all of things that I want to convey. I think communicating with audience is important for doing presentation in English."
NBE02013,"I think it important to speak with the enthusiasm that I want to convey. I cannot speak English well. But when I do my presentation, I try to speak more clearly, loudly and slowly. Because I want to convey information in my presentation. And I think the enthusiasm reaches audiences. So we should have the enthusiasm that I want to convey when we do a presentation."
NBE02739,"My opinion is that there are 2 big points for doing a good presentation in English, which are thinking about listener and making a good Power Point. First, we need to think about listener because the purpose of presentation is to have listener understand what we want tell them. For example, to make a presentation understandable, we should look at listeners expressively, speak with clear voice, and using easy English. The second, we need to making a good Power Point. It's maybe kind of thinking about listeners, but let's think about this as a different point because it is a big detail. Powerpoint should be attractive to get attention. So, in order to that, it would be better to keep in mind that we should use few keywords, use many pictures, and write notes if there are some difficult vocabulary. Thus it is important to think about listeners and make a Power Point for doing a good presentation in English."
NBE02764,"I think what doing nice presentation need are eye-contact, clear voice and well-organized slides. First, we should take eye-contact in presentation, because taking eye-contact make listener more listen and I can grasp degree of understanding of listener. For example, we have to look partner's eye when we talk to someone. Second, we should speak clearly during presentation. If we speak low, listener cannot listen what we said and cannot understand contents of presentation. Finally, we should make well-organized slides used in presentation. We use as little words as possible and several pictures on slides. Such slides make listener understand more. In conclusion, I think taking eye-contact, speaking clearly and organizing slides well are very important for doing presentation."
NBE01957,I think being able to speak what to think is the most important thing. So I should expand my vocabulary and practice to pronunciation.
NBE02141,"I think interesting theme is very important for good presentation. Because, to choose interesting theme is easier than to make progress English skills. So, to choose good theme is easy and important for us. After it, we should practice our English skills."
NBE02504,"In my opinion, it is the most important to make listeners understand my own presentation, so we have to use simple words as much as possible and speak clearly. Of course we sometimes have to use difficult words according as I choice difficult subject matter, but we make efforts to convert difficult words into simple words flexibly. In order to speak clearly, we have to take a lot of time to practice our speech of presentation and memorize my draft of speech completely. In conclusion, we have to take a lot of time to complete our presentation."
NBE02434,"I think organizing is important. The way of it is different from in Japanese to in English. Introduction have to be attractive and clear conclusion is usually said at first in English presentation. making eye contact and not looking your notes all the time, speak clearly not swaying back and forth like pendulum, and facial expressions are also important."
NBE02530,"I think that it is the most important to make the main point which oneself wants to tell to a partner clear. This is why the contents become plain naturally because it is decided mainly on the main point by doing so it. In addition, I think that I come to strongly read the part which I want to tell more by being conscious of the main point"
NBE02555,"I think that most important thing of presentation is the motivation to tell. Of cause, eye contacts, presentation and the volume of voice are important. But the motivation moves the listener's hearts and concentrates to listen."
NBE01697,"presentations with fewer explanations are easier to understand, but It's not good to have little detail. Furthermore if it's too long to remember, It will cause that we can't catch listeners' reactions. Therefore, the balance is important. presentations in English are difficult for us to conduct, but much more difficult to understand. Then slides help us understand more, and pictures and figures are more powerful for listeners, so It's better to explain with dynamic slides with a little word. Of course, it's essential to memorize our presentation. If do so, we can speak with accents in important points and It will be better with eye contact."
NBE01475,"I think the most important point in the presentation is ""simple"". It is important to be clear about what you want to convey, and explain it easy to understand. If you talking about too much, it is rather difficult to understand."
NBE02634,I think that it's important for presenter to speak clearly and make sure to tell what you want to tell to the listeners. It is not enough just speaking clearly. You need make sure that listeners understand what you said from their reaction or their faces. I learned this thing from my presentation.
NBE02660,"I believe the most important point is eye contacts and some gestures, not passages we speak or pronunciation of the language. It is proved by the fact that the other day Japanese Tanaka Rie's speech of inviting the Olympics was very highly admired in the world. At the time I feel her English skill itself is not so good, but she smiled and made gestures all the time during the presentation. Maybe those elements are more important when we present to foreign people because they talk with their 'eyes', while Japanese often look at the paper on the desk during other's presentation."
NBE01933,"I think the most important thing is ""simple"". The listener does not read if I write words for the slide too much. The listener will not hear all if I talk too much. Talking and writing have to be minimal. Steve Jobs did only minimum explanation as an expert of the presentation. And also important thing is ""voice"". We should speak loudly in a clear voice."
NBE02584,"In my opinion, what is most important for a good presentation is giving your listeners eye contacts because they attract their attention and make you look confident. These two things is needed when you do a presentation. And I think speaking fluently is also needed because clear words make it easier to understand the contents than unclear ones."
NBE02715,"I think the most important thing when we do presentation is to try to make eye-contact with listeners. Doing so, we can see their reaction, in other words, we can grasp whether they understand the topic of our presentation or not. If we do so, we can put the phrase they don't understand in simpler terms on the spot. But for doing so, we should prepare minutely and practice so hard. So we have to understand the details and main points in order to enable them to understand more easily."
NBE02385,"The most important thing for doing a good presentation in English, I think, is explaining details simply. It is because it is always more difficult to listen to explanations than to read the passages. Especially when you give a presentation to non-native English speakers, you should try to use easy that everyone can understand. Last week, one of the students whom I sat by the same table with kept talking really fast in vague voice, though the classroom was very noisy. However, the next boy explained details in easy English, and I could know the main points precisely just by listening to his presentation and looking at slides."
NBE02361,I think is most important for doing presentations in English is that thinking what is importance for listeners. It is not until there are listeners that presentations are consisted. So speakers should think what is importance for listeners and tell its importance specifically. Therefore speakers have to devise vocabularies and expressions. They are not objects that itself expressing formal and simple.
NBE01236,"First, I think we should research deeply, and we have to answer questions if I am questioned anything. If I can't answer the question, Listener will think I don't understand the contents. Second, we should be a good speaker of English. If I can't speak English very well, people have to concentrate to listen my English, so they will not understand the contents deeply. Finally, we should see the eyes of listener. It means that I talk them, so they can feel relieved."
NBE01368,"I think it is important to explain slowly and to take eye contact in order to know whether a listener is understood or not. And, I feel that it helps understand to repeat an important point . If there are many words to hear for the first time , so explaining a term first is good way to help listener's understanding. Not to mention, it is important understanding contents well and talking by good pronunciation in a loud voice. However, I feel it is important to explain slowly carefully particularly when we give presentation in English ."
NBE01451,"I think the most important thing is eye contact in presentation. Communication makes our presentations clear. Without eye contact, our presentation would be boring. It is too difficult to use perfect English, but we should try to use English. Active motivation makes our presentations well-organized."
NBE01909,"I think that speaking loudly and making eye contact are very important things for doing a good presentation in English. The most important purpose of presentations is communicating information to others. Without loud speaking and eye contact, you cannot communicate any information to them. However, most Japanese, including me, cannot do them well. So I need to get accustomed doing them."
NBE01391,"The most important thing when we make a presentation is ""passion"" I thought. Needless to say English skill or eye contact are also necessary skills, but ""passion"" engages listener's attention more easily I think. So we should research a topic more carefully and make a presentation passionately."
NBE01284,"To make a better presentation, the most important process is to find a good material that is easy to understand and interesting. No matter how attractive the slides are, no matter how fluent I speak English, difficult story is difficult to understand itself. Well-ordered slides are also important to make a better presentation. It is not good to write too many words in a slide, but it is not good to write few words. Next time, I want to make a good presentation, keeping these points in mind."
NBE02610,"After doing my presentation, I had a feeling that it was difficult to tell what I want to say. To do so, you have to speak easy English, face to the listener, have many pictures, and make contents brief and easy to understand. Especially, you have to put yourself in the listener's shoes. I think this is most important for good presentations."
NBE01836,"I think that confidence is the most important at a presentation. It is because I can talk clearly if I have confidence. Moreover, it can talk and looking at a partner. If it practices so that I have confidence, I will regard a presentation as being memorized. I think that Making it grand with confidence considered."
NBE01724,"I learned that it is difficult to make my speech without looking at the paper written what to say. But if I try to emphasize or make some gestures when I speak what I want to tell, it will become better presentation. In the last presentation's case, everyone made their speeches at the same time. It might made me forced to speak aloud from start to end. So next time, I want to challenge to make my speech in the silence situation."
NBE02241,"I think that important points are eye contact and clear pronunciation in a presentation. Eye contact is the foundations of a presentation. I think that the eye contact can convey a feeling. I think that clear pronunciation is required in order to give information correctly. Unless the right information is transmitted, there is no meaning of a presentation. I think that people's attitude to hear is also important. A presenter's motivation will also be lost if an attitude is bad."
NBE02185,"I think the most important thing for presentation is to speak clearly. When I listen to other's presentation, I sometimes can't listen the main point. It's because the voice is unclear. The purpose of presentation is inform listeners of information. Speaker should be conscious of speaking clearly and slowly."
NBE01641,"The most important thing in a presentation is using easy words, I think. We cannot understand difficult English, so using easy words are required. Also, I feel that I have to make my presentation much more conscience next time. Speaking in a loud voice is also very important. If presenter speak in a small voice, we cannot understand what he or she is saying. I have to practice more for the next presentation."
NBE01500,"I think it is important for good presentation to guess if listeners can understand means of presentation. Of course, it's important to make a presentation which is easy to be understood, but to guess listeners' ideas are more important. But if we are crazy only to do presentations, we can't look at listeners and judge listeners' ideas. So we must look at listeners and we should make communications with listeners as possible as we can. So I can't look at the manuscripts and do presentation like speaking."
NBE01812,"I think the attitude to convey our message to a listener is important for doing a good presentation. If we try to persuade a partner, we will prepare for a presentation before. Firstly, we should understand our news completely and memorize. Then, we need check that there is no words we don't know and whether we explain difficult words. Secondly, when we do a presentation, it is important that we speak clearly and look listener' s eyes. Listeners try listening carefully if we do that. In conclusion, if we have a mind try to do a good presentation, we can do it."
NBE02216,"The most important things to give a good presentation are: speaking clearly, making eye-contacts, catching the audiences' interest. I think those 3 things are the key."
NBE02688,"I think 2 things are the most important things to give a good presentation. First thing is ""attitude"". For example , trying not to see a memo , to tell simply enough to be understood by listener. Second is ""contents"" . However simple we give a presentation , it does not make sense if listener cannot understand the contents. So , contents are also important."
NBE01588,"I think some points are important to make good presentation. Above all, The most important point is to think about listeners. We should take care of listeners so that they can understand our presentation better. For example, we should speak with loud voice and we should look at listeners eye."
NBE01747,"In doing a presentation, I think what is most important is to get the listeners to understand what you want to say. In order to do that, you have to talk to the listeners and look at the listener's eyes, and care if they could understand you. And the speed you talk seems important to make one understand as well. Remembering the details of your speech will also help you to pay more attention to the listeners."
NBE01886,I learned two things for good presentation. The first point is to memorize the manuscript. It is important to do clear presentation because I can always see the listener and utter clear pronunciation. Second is to make the clear slide. The pictures and figures so much attached to the context make the listener understand the contents easily.
NBE02319,"What is most important for doing good presentation is having confidence in my own presentation, I suppose. If I have no confidence, my voice is getting smaller and communications between me and listeners are getting difficult. I think it is also important to make it clear why I want to make listeners know the contents of my presentation. It helps me speech logically."
NBE02041,"I learned 3 things from my presentation. To make a better presentation, the most important process is to find a good material that is easy to understand and interesting. Second, confidence is important at a presentation. Also, I feel that I have to make my presentation much more clearly next time and I want to do presentation better than this time."
NBE06352,"I learned not only main points of each news but also how to do presentations. Presentation has to be clear and easy to understand for listeners. Slides also have to be clear, because it will be helpful to understand the contents of the news. I could know other teams were interested in what kind of news by this presentation. One of my group members chose a similar news with our teams', but I could learn the other main points of the news by him. I thought I would like to try to research more and to do a presentation from various viewpoints in the next time."
NBE02268,"Indeed, the World Cup should bring development and money. But it is the benefit of the future people. It cannot be helped that Hundreds of thousands of people rallied as a protest movement because their money levied will return not them but the prosperity of Brazil. I think that the World Cup should bring also energy to a people. In 2011, the terrible earthquake struck Japan, especially Tohoku district. Being influenced by the disaster, Japanese people seem to be less energetic in these days. Japan, the country which seeks vitality, is just the right country for staging the World Cup."
NBE01546,"Of course, I think it is good to stage the World Cup in Brazil, but the government should make sure that socially disadvantaged people can lead lives where they do not cause such demonstrations. I think that big inequality of wealth among people in Brazil is the main cause of this accidents. If poor people are benefited enough economically, they would be able to stand even when government raise taxes. Anyway I think that social security is important issue in every country to solve problems like this accident."
NBE02142,"The World Cup is very popular event all over the world and this event has many merits for the host country. But these merits must not precede happiness of people. Moreover, many countries want to hold The World Cup. If It is not held in Brazil, it may be able to be held in other country. So, I think governments must protect happiness of people."
NBE02505,"The World Cup is the most international soccer tournament held every four years. It is good for host country Brazil, because it brings development and money. However, it will cost host country a lot of money to prepare the World Cup. In my opinion, the world Cup should be staged by not only host country's government but also its people, and its government must convince its people to pay the cost of preparing the World Cup. If people in host country Brazil strongly oppose for staging the World Cup, its government have to reconsider the World Cup. Of course the World Cup is important for host country, but host country have to pay attention to points in dispute, such as a hike in public transport fares, more than the World Cup and should make efforts to solve them, preceding all others. I hope that Brazil solve them completely and the World Cup is held in Brazil."
NBE02089,"I felt a little complicated when I read this article. Many people in the world are looking forward to have the world cup. Also many of the soccer fans long to have world cup in their own country. However the news shows that many of the Brazilians are not welcoming the world cup. This is contrary to my expectation. I think that development or a big project which ignores the people can be harmful. Developing countries, including Brazil, should more think about the people's quality of life and don't be attracted to much by the immediate profit."
NBE02740,"I felt how people dissatisfied with the government. According to this article, people have made a protest because of the bad quality of public services and the high cost of staging the World Cup. To tell the truth, I could understand about the bad quality of public services, but I have never thought the high cost of staging the World Cup would be a cause of the protest because I thought Brazil was famous for soccer. So, I was surprised when I knew the governments in Brazil actually have just wasted money for the World Cup. Of course, I like the World Cup, but I don't want Brazil to be in a financial crisis. So, I hope the Brazilian government will solve this problem soon."
NBE02014,"I was surprised at protest demonstrations in Brazil when I was pleased and sad in what Samurai blue's game. I look forward to the World Cup. So I want Brazil to hold it. However, if it causes economic conditions of the nation, I cannot become selfish. Brazil will be able to get profit by World Cup. I think the government should show the outgoing and incoming expectation to the nation."
NBE02786,"I love the World Cup because it is the hottest event in the world and very exciting. So I was very surprised at the protests. I understood the problems in Brazil. However, I think the World Cup is necessary for people all over the world, also for people in Brazil. It is because it is very popular and bring good influence to the Brazilian economy. So I expect Brazil will have a good economic policy and it will be successful."
NBE01725,"It will be difficult problem to hold World Cup or take precedence over economic policy. But it is true that poverty breaks people's heart. So I think the government should listen to what the demonstrators say. Holding World Cup should be after the solution of the trouble. As for me, I can't enjoy soccer game in the situation. So even if the World Cup make the government wealthy, they shouldn't take action under the trouble."
NBE02242,"I think it good for Brazil to hold World Cup. Soccer is a national sport for Brazil. Much money may be applied to holding. However, I think that there is an economic effect of an absurd big frame if Brazil wins the victory in the World Cup. If Brazil misses a championship, Brazil will go into the red. Probably, many people have a question in having held the convention. Great expectation will start the representative of Brazil for soccer. But I think that there is power which meets the expectation in Neymar."
NBE01392,"World cup is really famous soccer invent, and there are many funs all over the world. I also like watching soccer game, so this news was shocked for me. Government should care about their citizens first of all."
NBE01499,"After I read this article, I was so interested in it because I belonged to soccer club, so I like soccer very well. But I think it is interested in not only me but also many Japanese. Recently, Japan soccer team has became stronger and most Japanese must expect the next World Cup. But I think The World Cup can be held in wherever. Brazil is strong in soccer, but citizens are against for holding The World Cup. I wonder how The Government suppresses this protest movement and if it's possible to success The World Cup."
NBE02408,People from all over the world loves World Cup. I think hosting World Cup make people exciting and make the country wealthy. So I think it is good for Brazil to host World Cup. But it is clear that people in Brazil are dissatisfied with their government now. The government should listen to the people and solve a problem before they host a World Cup.
NBE02687,"Next year , World Cup will be hold in Brasil. Brasil is the country that the gap between the rich and poor is intense. If supporters from many countries come Brasil , they spend the money only safety area : the area the rich lives. So , the poor remains to be poor. I think that's why the protest happened."
NBE01369,"I am surprised with the size of the protest is large, To Judging from the size of a large protest, politics of Brazil does not seem well. I do not know much information about Brazil, so I do not know which is the cause of the demonstration; the intention of the government doesn't become widely known to the public, or the government is corrupt. However, the ability of the government's shortage is clear. Also, I'm worried about whether urban functions are working. If Demonstration continues, it is inevitable to decline of the economy and urban function. I hope that Brazil will settle down soon."
NBE01370,"I am surprised with the size of the protest is large, To Judging from the size of a large protest, politics of Brazil does not seem well. I do not know much information about Brazil, so I do not know which is the cause of the demonstration; the intention of the government doesn't become widely known to the public, or the government is corrupt. However, the lack of the ability of the government is clear. Also, I'm worried about whether urban functions are working. If demonstration continues, it is inevitable to decline of the economy and urban function. I hope that Brazil will settle down soon."
NBE02556,"Now, Tokyo is working hard to get the right to be able to be held the Olympic Games. The people of Tokyo feel the complicated feelings. Generally, the city can invite the Olympic Games will grow the economy and industry. But like this article, the government should understand what the people really need."
NBE02557,"sorry, I missed World Cup and Olympic."
NBE01856,"Of course , I want Brazil to hold World Cup but I also think this country should consider medical care and education of the children. If this protest will going on , World Cup of Brasil may be canceled. I think it is very sorry. This World Cup may be a start of an economic growth. I hope World Cup of Brasil is held !!!"
NBE02116,"Holding World Cup promotes the economic growth. Not only World Cup, but also Olympic in 2016 is to be held in Brazil. These events cost a lot to be held, but the benefits are much bigger. For example, Tokyo Olympic in 1964 promoted Japanese economic growth and thanks to that a transportation network spread. The government of Brazil and the people should cooperate and make Brazil a better country."
NBE02765,"I had thought that Brazilian were so pleased to stage World Cup in Brazil where is soccer kingdom. Therefore, I was surprised at protest demonstrations in Brazil when I hear this news. I think that other countries should spend money to Brazil to help staging World Cup in soccer kingdom."
NBE02716,"When I heard the news, I thought I had not been very interested in demonstrations I unusually saw on the street. Having heard a major victory of Brazilian people, I learned the importance of demonstrations insisting our thoughts and ideas. As they caught the victory, the power of nations sometimes actually change the plan or the idea of the government. So I realized that it is very, very important to insist our idea raising our voice. I think it can be said in other various situation and to various problems. So I would like to insist my thoughts positively."
NBE02215,"I was surprised to hear that there is a protest marching against World Cup, as I thought it always brings positive outcomes especially in economics. I knew that corruption is one of the most serious issues in Latin-American countries, but I have nothing to say for that. My knowledge of politics is poor and the problem does not seem relative to my daily life."
NBE01452,I think hosting World Cup is good for Brazil. It makes Brazil affluent. Many people in Brazil can enjoy watching games. Therefore I was surprised to read this news. I think the government of Brazil should consider Brazilians. All people in Brazil should live happily.
NBE02386,"I understand the demonstrator's feelings. Although I do not really know how the Brazilian government is irresponsible for economic policies, I can still see that people are angry at the act of the today's government. By reading this article, it seems that people and the government have not discussed Brazil's future course. Without reflecting public opinion, the government has been trying to stage the World Cup aggressively, so people have not agreed with it. People may not want to waste their money, if they cannot be convinced that the World Cup will bring development and money. Considering that fact, I think they should talk over their issues more each other. It is the government role that it explains concretely how the society will improve if it invest in the World Cup until people understand. Also it is important for the government to clarify the reason why the economy remains stagnant and how it thinks to recover. If they do these things carefully, the demonstration could be moderated."
NBE01986,"I think Brazil protests should be continued. Of course, people who protest should not use violence to make government change their plan. However, whether people do whatever actions, government can not change their plans in related to world cup program. People have no choice but use power. So they continued protests."
NBE02480,"The demonstrate in Brazil this time was very significant. Because the Confederations Cup and the World Cup are in the spotlight. If the Olympic take place in Japan, demonstrate would happen? Recently we could see demonstrate to nuclear power plant. I think there are happen that big demonstrate to politics. It is problem that demonstrate doesn't happen rather happen. Japanese have to say our opinion."
NBE02063,"I was so surprised, when I saw this news. Because I didn't know Brazil has many serious problem. in my imagination, Brazil's economic is growing and Brazilian's life becomes rich so they are happy. But in fact Brazilian's life is severe enough to gather 800, 000 people to do demonstration. If this protest activity aim to tell to the world about this issue, it works. Many people in the world saw this news and leaned Brazil have many problem. And I think Brazilian should continue protesting, by doing so, their life will be better, but I think they have to do demonstration with no violence, no riot, no looting, and no bloodshed. At last I hope their life will be good and will held wonderful and happy World cup and Olympic."
NBE02362,"Generally speaking, that staging the World Cup bring a huge sum of positive economic effect for the host country. Of course, Brazil is the host country of the World Cup in 2014 will receive this benefit. One of examinations says Brazil will receive 142, 000, 000 real as economic effect and create employment of 3, 000, 000 people. Although, the protesters raise their voice about expenses for World Cup, corruption, poor public service and so on. Brazil is a rising country developed rapidly, while it has various problems still. I think if Government hope for developing and getting ripe country, it should listen to the people's voice. Brazil will not probably join developed countries without satisfying the people. So I think, Government has to make a social system the people accepted before the World Cup and Olympic."
NBE02635,"I think that protesters don't protest to staging the Confederations Cup and the World Cup but to cost of staging. I know Brazilian like soccer, so everyone may think hosting the Cups is good to Brazil. But they don't like the government waste too much money. Brazilian Government should understand their feelings, save the money and stage the Cups in peace."
NBE01571,"In Japan, the government often doesn't make policies that reflect public opinions even though people protest in a proper way. For example, when they protested against construction of dams, American army bases, or reoperation of nuclear power plants, they could not draw out any concrete measure from the government. For this reason, I was very surprised at the success of the demonstration in Brazil. The will of the people affected the authorities!! Even though there may be some people who have not been satisfied with the result, it is great that they raised a cry of protest and overturned the government's decision. I think staging Confederations Cup and World Cup itself has a good effect on economy, but Brazil government should open the information to satisfy its people and carry out the policies showing the sincerity."
NBE01674,I was surprised at the news and I felt that the protest movement was dangerous. I did not know Brazil protests until I read this article. I think that mounting public resentment caused this protest movement. I also think that the government should be fully aware of the minds of a nation.
NBE02296,"I think it good to hold the World Cup in Brazil. Because a possibility of Brazil that immense economical profits can be obtained is high. However, people feel dissatisfaction for using it for World Cup holding of a tax with an immense state. Therefore, people have caused the riot. I think that there is even a possibility that such a riot will have a bad influence on the world economy."
NBE01910,"I was very surprised because I think that Brazil is a peaceful country. It is true that there are a lot of crimes in Brazil. However, Brazil is not a country that there are many riots in the country. Its system is democracy. And brazilian economy is growing rapidly. So I couldn't expect the riot. the riot might be caused because people couldn't keep up with great changes in this country."
NBE02455,"I think this protest is not good for everyone living in brazil. Even though there is people who don't want WC to be held, protesting now is too late. And it is better for them to make efforts to make WC successful."
NBE01934,"I couldn't understand this news at first. The Brazilian people were pleased that Brazil was chosen as the site of World Cap. However, the people insist that they do not hold it now. Why the people don't want to hold World Cap? Answer is ""no money"". But I think that profit is over the World Cup. Furthermore, it is necessary to heap up it so that profit appears. I think that people should find former big profit than a short-term loss for two years or three years."
NBE01813,"I think a demonstration is one of the effective means that people appeal to the government. If their opinions are difficult to be accepted, the demonstration itself is worth doing. The government can know people's thoughts directory and have a opportunity to think again about the problem. It is important for people that they protest against public problems. They can share complains with other people who gave up improving the situation once and encourage them to protest. And by becoming the the topic, the demonstration will spread and inform many people of the present issue. I think there are few demonstrations in Japan. If Japanese people express their opinions together, young people will also have more interests in politics and the situation will have taken a turn for the better than now."
NBE01237,"I like watching soccer game, and playing soccer. So I am looking forward to seeing World Cup! But, in Brazil, people demonstrated. It is very dangerous for the player, if World Cup is held. If demo continue, World Cup should not be held in Brazil."
NBE02661,"Wherever the country invites the Olympics, they always meet more or less with residents' complaint because of such examples in Brazil. Although the government has serious problems about the way to use money, they don't have to give up holding the Olympics and World Cup. This is because the two are the biggest sports events in the world and they will bring good economy. I believe that they finally will give Brazil numerous amount of money that might solve the protest movement over the quality of public services as a result. Of course, I can understand the validity of people's protest but they finally should be satisfied with the Games."
NBE02435,"Before I read this news, I thought Confederations Cup and the World Cup are welcomed favorably. I never thought about such protests movement when I enjoyed watching the soccer game on TV. I agree the 28-year-old medical student in this article because the good economic impact are expected by hosting these events. I think it makes people happy and give positive energy to hold world-wide championships. Actually, I'm so excited because Tokyo invites Olympics now. Of course, I also think that the government have to be take countermeasures in order not to waste money."
NBE02531,"Because I thought that soccer is the most popular in Brazil, I was surprised when I heard this news. But I have come to the conclusion that Brazilian is also looking forward to WC in Brazil, however the situation of their life is bad, so they were not able to miss this perfect opportunity to attract attention from the world. I think this demonstration is the effective means that people appeal to the government. I hope that the quality of their life will improve and WC will held on peacefully!!"
NBE01476,"I also think staging the Cups is good for Brazil. It bring not only money but also popularity. In Japan, some people also say that ""Tokyo Olympic""wastes money. But there are no corruption, this is not true. I hope government should correct the corruption."
NBE01958,"I think protest movement is good because it signify people are interested in politics. Big protest movement don't happen in Japan. Because Japanese politic is stable comparing with foreign countries. But, another reason, Japanese aren't interested in politics comparing with foreign countries."
NBE02585,"I think it's high time that Brazil stops the corruption. People there have got the chance to realize that because the government is sensitive to their big movement, for the World Cup will be held there and people around the world pay attention to it, thinking of the security."
NBE01788,"Many countries think that they invite World Cup to be important, because it makes big profit. However I object to it. It will surely have many merits to hold such a big meeting at own country, but, at the same time it is a fact that various problems such as the aggravation of the peace and order occur. Particularly, they should still less do it when the nation objects like Brazil of this article. When a nation collects large amount of tax and torments people, it becomes illogical. Similarly I think Tokyo shouldn't spend money to stage the Olympics because many of the people are unconcerned about to hold the Olympics in Tokyo. It is useless of a tax. I think that Tokyo should do it more."
NBE01615,"In Japan, sometimes people demonstrate on street, but they seem to make no effect on government's plan. I think it's because of the sizes of demonstrations. Japanese have less consciousness of changing politics ourselves, so the demonstration's scale don't be so big. So the number of people who participated in Brazilian demonstration and its impact on government surprised me. The power of mass ordinary people is actually forcible."
NBE01837,"It agrees, if I am the Brazil people. I am a country and think that it is good to carry out sponsorship of Confederations Cup or the World Cup. A country consumes money by sponsoring. However, a country yields profits. For example, the increase in tourists, etc. That is, I think that it is good to sponsor."
NBE01417,"I think demonstrations are important to make one's country better. I have two reasons for this. First, demonstrations have power to change one's country's policy. For example, in Egypt , many ordinary citizen joined the demonstration, and the political system of a state changed. Second, by joining the demonstration, people will have a good opportunity to criticize their own country objectively. By doing so, a country can be better . So I think demonstration in Brazil is important to make Brazil better."
NBE02611,"Japanese people often demonstrate about governmental policies. Recently, I saw the demonstration about objection to participating in TPP. Foreigners living in Japan also sometimes demonstrate about the governmental attitude to their mother countries. However, I seldom see demonstrations about more political things such as democracy, the Tenno system, government collapses, peace and war. It is said that this is because Japan is already democratic society, so the government fully reflect the will of the people. However, it seems to me that there is another reason. It is the political apathy among the young people. Few decades ago, university students often demonstrated about political things. Today, it is common for the young people not to vote elections. It is not always said that demonstrations can change the country, but it is clear that demonstrations make opportunities to interact the government."
NBE01698,"Demonstrations are not so common in Japan, and I've never thought of doing it. It's because we are happier, but it's possible for me to conduct it in the future, so I should think carefully about it. Money and education are much more important for people than world cup, so it's natural that people in Brazil demonstrated, and I noticed how demonstrations are powerful thanks to it. However, it was better if they had achieved it without violence, so I think we should demonstration with peace way such as demonstration parades and campaign to collect signatures."
NBE02186,"I was disappointed to hear this news. I thought that all Brazilian love soccer so they hope to stage World Cup but it's not true. I don't think staging World Cup is ""wasted money""."
NBE01642,"I have never thought about the negative effect of the World Cup. I had expected that every one like sports and it is very good for everyone to hold such big sport tournament in their home countries. So I was very sad to hear this news. Not only the World Cup, but also many factors make this demonstration. It is true that Brazil has a lot of problems to solve, however, I hope that people there can live peaceful."
NBE02166,"It is natural that people claim about government's policy. A nation must compensate people's life, that is the most important thing a nation to do. And I was surprised at police fired tear gas. It means that citizen and government are enemy. government have to apologize to people and persuade people,"
NBE01548,"I do not think Japanese people have less consciousness of changing politics themselves. People in Brazil participate in the demonstration because the government corruption is so bad and people severely wants it to change. Of course, corruption exists in political systems of Japan to some extent, but the government make effort to secure the lives of people as possible. I think people in Japan think they do not have to change government policy."
NBE01748,"I think it quite natural that the people take actions when the authorities go wrong, and they should as positively as possible in democratic countries. In Japan, many people are ignorant of and uninterested in politics. We usually exercise our political right when the elections are held, at least once a few years. But in particular situations, this frequency seems not quite enough. People in Japan should take more actions and try to reflect their thoughts on the politics."
NBE01285,"I know what's going on in Brazil, but every time I hear about the news, I always think about a dilemma the gap between the rich and the poor and the developing of economy. As for the government of Brazil, it is important to hold the World Cap to show the economic power of Brazil. However, as for citizens, not few people don't care about the World Cap. They need a job and public service. The Government should act equally to both sides of people - those who are poor and those who want to get the benefit of the World Cap."
NBE01501,"I agree with your opinion. I hope that The World Cup will success and life of Brazilian will be better than now. I think the demonstrate has good effect for changing ideas of the government too. Now, 209 countries and regions are members of FIFA. The number is more than the number of members of UN, 193 countries. So you understand how much soccer is popular, didn't you? There are not few poor countries in the world including Brazil. But I think sports have huge power , so development of sports can make life of people better. So it is so good chance for Brazil to develop. Of course there are so many and difficult problems and Brazil cannot solve them by oneself. So advanced nations, of course including Japan, should help for Brazil and I hope The World Cup will success for development of soccer and Brazil."
NBE02664,"I don't think people should continue demonstrating for a long time. When I did research in Brazil society and economy last year, I realized many people are still suffering from poverty while Brazil economy has been growing rapidly. So I am convinced that they demand raising the quality of public services. But the issue of hosting the Cups and Olympics is not related to the demo because people were jumping for joy when Brazil won the right to host them. I think it is not proper for people to make complaints in this period of time."
NBE02364,"I agree with your opinion. I think also Government of Brazil should consider Brazilians. Otherwise, Brazil will not probably join developed countries forever. If Brazil will become developing and getting ripe country and all people in Brazil will live happily, it should listen to the people's voice. I hope the World Cup in Brazil will success and all people in Brazil will enjoy it!"
NBE01936,I disagree with your opinion. It is not bad to hold the World Cup it a working-out method of the budgets to be bad. I think that it becomes the profit of the nation by all means if we look in the long term.
NBE02508,"I agree with you. I like soccer very much, and so I am really looking forward to World Cup. However, in Brazil there are more serious problems, such as a hike in public transport fares, than World cup. So the government in Brazil need to solve them first of all and should convince all people in Brazil to hold World cup, in my opinion."
NBE02066,"I expect the activity of Japan too. I look forward to Brazil World Cup, also Brazilian wait anxiously too. I think probably Brazilian don't oppose to holding the World Cup, they protest against the cost too high and economic disparity. If their lives is painful, they can't afford to enjoy World Cup. So I think government have to consider all of Brazilian's life."
NBE01523,"I was surprised to hear that there is a protest marching against World Cup. I thought it always brings positive outcomes especially in economics. I knew that corruption is one of the most serious issues in Latin-American countries, but I have nothing to say for that. If demonstration continues, it is inevitable to decline of the economy and urban function. I hope that Brazil will settle down soon."
NBE01913,"I agree with your idea. Japanese government slights demonstrations. However, the number of people who participate in demonstration is very different. In Japan, we cannot imagine that 800, 000 people protest against the government. I think Japan is a very peaceful country."
NBE02245,I approve of this opinion. Brazil is holding the chance. It is holding the World Cup. I expect that it will be held by me in Brazil. It will certainly have influence good for Brazil.
NBE01961,"I disagree with ID13012 's opinion. I think demonstration is higher politic movement. Revolution is illegal. But demonstration is legal. Certainly, violent demonstration is not good. But legal demonstration should be continued. So brazil's demonstration is not settled down easily."
NBE01701,"I agree with you. I think that the purpose of World Cup is originally making people happy, so it will be like cart before the horse if we hold it under the situation that people don't wish to be held."
NBE02482,"I disagree with your comment. Because I think demonstration can't avoid violence. If protests continue demonstration, people who are injured increase. Protests have to think another way for change the government."
NBE01261,I think that this movement was good thing and necessary. Because I think citizen should show government their opinion. And this movement could show government their opinion. So government understood their opinion and I think this is the first step to improve .
NBE01884,"I agree with you. The World Cup may be able to bring Brazilian the development and money, but it is the matter of future. the government must understand that there are now lots of people live in poverty."
NBE01885,"The World Cup may be able to bring Brazilian the development and money, but it is the matter of future. the government must understand that there are now lots of people live in poverty."
NBE01421,"I disagree with your opinion that ""people should find former big profit than a short-term loss for two years or three years. "" I don't think that no money is the only reason for this demonstration . Brazilian got angry because government didn't work well. So if there was lots of money, Brazilian would demonstrate because the government is not good."
NBE02169,i agree with you. a world cup must be a event that makes people happy.
NBE01989,"I disagree with his opinion. People in Brazil have no choice but protest by violence. if they could not do so, this does government harm."
NBE02441,I agree with this opinion and I could get a new viewpoint from this comment. I'm so excited and looking forward to Olimpicgame in Tokyo. And I just think it is good for poor people to grow the economy by hosting the games. I learned we should consider the gap between the rich and the poor.
NBE02437,I could get a new viewpoint from this comment. I'm so excited and looking forward to Olimpicgame in Tokyo. And I just think it is good for poor people to grow the economy by hosting the games. I learned we should consider the gap between the rich and the poor.
NBE01596,"World Cup is one of the biggest event all over the world. And host country could get a lot of economic benefit. So, it is natural that every country wants to held World Cup in their country. But a country must take care not only economic benefit but also country's social problem such as unemployment rate."
NBE02318,"It is exciting to watch the worldwide event in our own country, so I was very confused when I first read this article. I can never imagine that I demonstrate against staging the World Cup in Japan. However, it is only because Japan is not so much suffering financial crisis and the standard of living in Japan is comparatively stable. Governments should not do things that doesn't match the present situation of their countries."
NBE01344,"I worried about it would have a bad effect of holding World Cup in Brazil. Certainly, to host World Cup bring their nation a lot of profit. It must be useful to rise their standard of living. I'm sure that it will guide the nation to be happiness."
NBE01318,I think these protest should be apart from sports event like world cup. The government should make sure that socially disadvantaged people can lead lives where they do not cause such demonstrations. I hope that Brazil solve them completely and the World Cup is held in Brazil
NBE02338,"I was really surprised about this news and I also worry about the news. This is because protest's movement is really dangerous thing. I think I am not able to understand what Brazilian people think about this news, because of I am Japanese. But, World Cup would bring a lot of profit for Brazil. As a result of this, standard of living of Brazilian people will rise. So that I think movement of government is good, but government need to care about their citizens."
NBE02614,"I agree with your opinion. Brazilian people protest about the government policies. Therefore, the government should reflect the popular will and improve the social security. If the government solve the problems and host World Cup smoothly, Brazil can get big money and prosper increasingly."
NBE02691,I agree with your opinion because the money given by sponsor and a lot of tourists is enormous
NBE02017,I agree the opinion. I think government should protect both citizens and The World Cup.
NBE02042,"I was shocked when I read this article because there are clearly the gap of motivation for World Cup between the nation and world. In fact, the World Cup should bring development and money. Although I think it is good to stage the World Cup in Brazil, the government should make Brazilian social peaceful. No one can enjoy soccer game in the situation. So, we have to help Brazil and make more peaceful this nation."
NBE02457,I disagree with you. it is more important to make efforts preparing for WC. Since WC has been decided to be held.
NBE01347,"I agree with you. The World Cup is the most exciting event. If this movement won't finish, The World Cup maybe won't be able to held in the future. Unless Brazilian economy is recovered, the movement will never finish. The World Cup will make a lot of profit, so I expect Brazilian economy is improved."
NBE02320,"I don't agree with you. For sure, staging events such as World Cup will bring profits to Brazil. However, it is very risky and it can cause more violent protests from citizens."
NBE01769,"In Brazil, many people believe that the government ignores the people's lives, and it seems a natural reaction. But I think the decision of the government is a reasonable one. The problem is that the government could not make the people understand that their policy make some benefits to them in the end. How reasonable their policy is, if not be understood, they naturally lose their trust."
NBE02897,"I'm concerned about having a similar situation in Japan. The Olympic Games will be held in Tokyo in 2020. And, Japanese government is going to rise in consumption tax. I think that some people will claim to stop raising tax before host the Olympics. Japanese government should explain the need for increasing tax rate, and raise the general level of wages for all workers. Otherwise a huge demonstration would occur in Japan. I hope that the Olympic Games in Tokyo will be held in safety. Japanese government must create an enjoyable environment for the guest."
NBE06719,"I think the governments should think what give first priority to do. They should solve people's cause of dissatisfaction first. The government and the marchers should have talked about quality of life and holding World Cup. Now, Japan has the same as this problem. I think Japanese government has to solve problem of revival in the Tohoku district before staging the Olympic."
NBE07430,"World Cup will need a lot of money. But, it is true that visitors who come there pay money for various thing. For example hotel charge, taxi fee. Finally, economy will go smoothly. I think the Brazilian should cooperate for World Cup."
NBE01547,"I cannot decide which side(admiration of Snowden or rebuke of Snowden)I am willing to agree. Both sides have their own reasons for their claims. This news made me think about the question, "" Is it allowable to force people to be victims for the interests of the countries?"" Of course it is important to defend interests of countries, but I thought fundamental human rights should not be dismissed because these rights must be the important elements of democratic countries. Especially, privacy rights are significant in this information age."
NBE02217,"I would say that Snowden is both a hero and a traitor. Snowden may have broken the law, but it is obvious that national invasion of US citizens' privacy has much more to be impeached. This news reminded me of the last stage of nations such as USSR. Though Snowden is a traitor for the people who make a profit by secretly collected data, he is a hero for most of US citizens."
NBE02143,"I think Edward Snowden is a traitor because the government will not abuse any information they research. If we believe it, the nation can not exist in the first place. So, we should approve that research is for the society. But, invasion of privacy by malice government may exist. Then, we must support the whistleblower if he arrests. But, we do not need to support a traitor as if a hero."
NBE02558,"When I read this article, I think Edward Snowden has two sides of hero and traitor. Surely, though he believe what he did is right, it is against the low so his action is classified in bad things. But it is sure that there are the rights by his action. Whether he is hero or not is affected by what we think most important."
NBE01371,"To be frank, I felt that it is great that Edward acted even risked his position for a first impression. Although, I do not mean his actions are correct in all points . I think that if to divulge confidential benefit the public, his behavior may be correct for the most part. However, there is a risk confusing , he has to be careful if divulge confidential. In summary, the public's right to know and to defend the law, which should also be respected. So, this problem is difficult."
NBE01315,"I don't know which I should agree. They claimed their opinion based on their justice. But I think when it comes to collision between group force and a person, we should consider about basic human right : privacy right."
NBE01393,"This is difficult for me to decide that he is hero or traitor, which side is better? When I read this news, I thought low is really difficult thing. Even if someone does good thing for citizens, it sometimes happens that he is punished, like this news."
NBE02243,"I regard him as his being a hero. He did the treason act of leaking US information. However, I think that international society also needs those who do action like him. I want him to escape so that it may not be caught by the United States."
NBE02117,"I want to take a neutral position. What he did was brave, and thank to his action we could know the truth of NSA. He told us only using the Internet is dangerous. On the other hand, what he did was an illegal act. Letting out the secret should be punished. When he was employed, his employer didn't assume such an incident."
NBE02717,"Reading this article, frankly speaking, I would like to praise him. However, I disagree with his Edward Snowden's action. Surely, he did a important leak in American history. But he endangered so many people at the same time. It is to advantage of someone on the one hand, but it is to disadvantage of the other people on the other hand. If his action is admired breaking the low, where is the significance of the low's being?It means everybody can do anything which they regard as right thing. So I think he should have more thought carefully and reconsidered the importance of the low."
NBE02269,"To be shame, I think that spy is a virtual job in the movie. Frankly, I was so exciting during reading this article, though I understand it is serious news. However, I expect that the number of spy will decrease. Now, more and more countries are controlled by information and most of information are treated not via a person but via Internet. So, I think that ""a digital spy"" will be active in the future world."
NBE01749,"I don't think he did a very good job. Actually, he revealed the fact that there are lots of violating of human rights, but because of him some countries now cannot help avoiding the problems between other countries which they didn't want to touch. He caused visible conflicts around the world, some of which should be left untouched for the international peace. A perfectly clear government is impossible to be made, so I think he is a traitor."
NBE02767,"I think that this article is like a movie, because I can not believe spy really exist. I want to support Edward Snowden as hero of ordinary people. He did not choose his safety, but choose citizens's safety. I think that almost people could not choose citizen's safety. Therefore, I am being sides with him."
NBE01418,"I praise Edward Snowden for his act. I have two reasons for this. First, I think what he did is right , because his act could prevent National Security Agency from violating human rights. The act of US surveillance programs could be invasion of privacy, so someone should stop it. Second, I want to praise him for his courage. If I were him, I couldn't leak information of NSA, because I would be afraid that I will lose my job and be arrested. So, I regard Edward Snowden as a hero."
NBE02387,"I regard Edward Snowden as Traitor. He let out the important secret information all over the world, in spite of the fact that he was the former CIA employee, which is disgraceful for American society. CIA employees should have been forced to keep information secret. Why did he do that seriously? It is dangerous for the CIA to keep the person like that because the law will be violated and all of the system will be in disorder. I think the CIA should find people who cannot obey its regulation to fire them. As you can see that I feel as though Snowden is Traitor, I do not agree with the idea of ID1304106123136. I do not believe that international society also needs those who do action like him, because more people reveal international secrets, more countries will face the violation of the law. That leads the bad relationship with other countries, even in globalization times. However, I agree with ID13021 when he says Snowden has caused visible conflicts around the world. It can be said that a gulf has formed between Russia and the US To eliminate unnecessary conflict globally, we should keep some information on our own."
NBE02741,"When I heard this news, at first, I thought Edward had done virtuous conduct. However, after reading this article, I realized there was the exact opposite opinion that his action had been treason. Even though I still think his action was brave, because he tried telling us the fact despite the risk, I also think there is something in what they say. We often want to know facts but it is truth that there are sometimes facts which disturb the social order. As the saying goes, ""uso mo hoben "", which means it is sometimes necessary to lie. Facts are not always helpful for us, so I think it is very difficult to solve such information issue."
NBE01726,"For example, let's think about the case that one officer who works at Japan Coast Guard leaked a video of Chinese ship's attack at Senkaku. In the case the uploader was forced to retire the job because he transgressed the duty to keep the secret. But the leak revealed the government's conceal and he got so much support by many people and it led him to be innocent. But in this case, Edward Snowden doesn't seem to reveal government's definitive corruption, and only to be said ""valiant"". I can't praise the action like him because he didn't make the result to be a hero."
NBE02409,"I cannot decide whether he is a hero or a traitor. Of course he did break a law and it is not something to be praised. But thanks to him, we could know the information of NSA. His action was really brave and if I were him I would be too afraid to leak the information. It is too difficult for me to decide which side I should agree but there is one we all need to think about: privacy rights."
NBE02064,"I think he didn't have to expose that NSA collect call data from major US cell carriers. He just confused the public. But the other day, I read an article about US citizen tolerate that, NSA was collecting call data from major US cell carriers, to prevent terrorism. NSA said they did interception to prevent terrorism. I understand, of course it's necessary for national defense. On the other hand, many country said ""our national sovereignty was infringed. "" I can understand both opinion. National defense and fighting against terrorism are so difficult issues. I think we have to think about those issues."
NBE02662,"First of all, I'd like to admire Edward Snowden's brave action and regard him as a hero. I know what he did is unlawful and so he has received much more criticism or anger than admiration. However the most important fact is not its legality, but the details leaked by Snowden. He revealed that the U. S. authorities are monitoring each nation. Though they explain the program aims at preventing terrorism, I suppose it will be a total loss for general public. People probably don't want to be kept watch because of terrorism measures. In short, the program of NSA is vicious and we should take a look at this point. This article doesn't include opinions of the ordinary people. I think their opinions are more honest and significant because VIPs in the government or some organizations often say their thoughts by political position, not their own one."
NBE01987,"According to this article, ""Edward Snowden has been hailed as a hero of civil liberties and rebuked as a self-absorbed traitor for revealing information on classified National Security Agency programs aimed at preventing terrorism"". I think it is hard to decide whether he is traitor or hero. However, I have the only answer. In short, he is hero if you are people. he is traitor if you are CIA."
NBE01911,"I don't think he is a hero. It is true that the information he revealed is very serious problem. NSA shouldn't do such a thing for getting some useful information. However, it doesn't mean that he can justify his action. His action was unworthy of a secret agent. If he knew some information that the government did something wrong, he must have guard the secret. An agent has to guard the secret until he dies."
NBE01675,"I think that Edward Snowden is not a hero. I also think that whatever some reasons he has, he should not leak classified information on US"
NBE01238,"I can't answer this question, because this is difficult for me. Snowden broke low, but it is really bad!? If I have to answer this question, I will say ""He is hero"" But I have obvious reason."
NBE02219,"I partly disagree with naoeID13018's opinion. It is true that Edward Snowden has broken the law and he deserves punishment, but in terms of privacy issue, his act can be praised."
NBE01988,I agree with ID13007's idea. it is important to recognize that this problem is difficult to decide. Whether he is hero or agitator will be clear by time.
NBE02090,"We can't make a wholesale decision of whether Snowden is a hero or a traitor because we don't know the concrete information which Snowden leaked. It is true that classified information is important and the leak of the information may harm us, but at the same time, enforcement of the authority by the concealment of those information may strengthen the dictatorship and harm our freedom of life. And in my opinion, there are too many dark side in the US authority and this, Snowden's action is one of the step that may reveal the dark side to the people."
NBE02091,"I agree to your opinion , harry. Though the classified information may protect us from terrorism, surveillance against nation and whose people by single authority is a big problem, same as terrorism. Liberty should not be enjoyed by small part of nation or authority, it should be enjoyed by every people."
NBE02363,"When I heard this news, I thought he is ""traitor"". There is not a organization like CIA in Japan, so we are unfamiliar with spying and this news is like movie and drama. He defects from his own country by a sense of justice in order to prosecute on line crimes of America. In this way, I think that he thinks ""hero"" rather than""traitor""himself. Consequently I can't decide that he is ""hero"" or ""traitor""."
NBE02144,"I can not agree with ID13041's idea. If the nation allows the man like him, the nation will be destroyed by itself. In the first place, the government will not pervert the personal information. People should believe their government. Otherwise, they choose moving to other country or demurring to the government by the legitimate way."
NBE02145,"I agree with ID13018's idea. The political affairs always become white wash and use a lie, but those action is to protect their nations. I think this case fits it, so Edward Snowden is a traitor. However, people must think about the government particularly and prevent the abuse of power."
NBE02297,"When I heard this news, I thought that he was a traitor. As for the word ""spy"", Japanese people may not have familiarity. Possibly, it may be the word heard on the one scene of a movie. However, the occupation of CIA exists in the United States. After all, the personnel should keep the secrecy in the course of duties, also after retiring and it is the body which is that it is required for a country though, as for it, the country is supervising people , I think."
NBE02636,"I know Snowden broke the law but I think he is a hero because he did it for all American citizens as one American citizen not as a member of NSA. Many people in America, also in Japan, want to open all information but we did realize that the government hide many important information from this Snowden case. He made a sacrifice of his life and family to open information. This is a great decision, don't you think so?"
NBE02298,I agree with your opinion. It is because leaking the secrecy of a state level has influence in respect of being various.
NBE01935,"This thing is very difficult . As for his action, we can think both of right and wrong . I thought he is a hero at first, but I thought that on investigation he was a traitor. His action was not crime because it is an accusation . However, the action extinguishes the trust of a nation and the nation. All the actions that are not a crime may not be good. Only at the time of revolution, I could call him a hero."
NBE01838,"Edward thinks that he is a hero. It is a crime surely to steal confidential information. However, Edward who gave the information which should be given to people is a hero. The secret of a country needs to be known by people. So that the secret is large. Edward is brave."
NBE02506,"In my opinion, Edward Snowden did the wrong action that he leaked classified information on US surveillance programs. Of course, his action enabled people in US find that US violated their privacy, however his action endangered people in US Now that a lot of acts of terrorism happen in the world, and so the government have to take counter terror measures. One of them is U. S's collecting call data from major US cell carriers. I think that we should be willing for our government to violate our privacy in order to fly the approach of danger. In my conclusion, he is not a hero but a traitor."
NBE01839,"I can not agree with ID13018's idea. I regard Edward as his being a hero. Because, I think that the people have to know all the countries."
NBE02015,"He is a hero for American citizens. But I think he is a traitor. Because he received a salary from CIA. And the reason why he escapes is that he think I did a bad thing. If he think that I am a hero, he should not run away!"
NBE02689,I agree with your opinion because the leak of information should not be done.
NBE02016,"I think spy is to be in the movie, too. And I agree your pinion that spy will decrease for spreading Internet."
NBE02586,"In my opinion, he is a hero because he disclosed the information that American government violates many people's privacy in order to change this corrupt situation, in spite of being exposed to great danger. Maybe various countries do such things but if no one stands up, no one has any question about that and the situation lasts forever. He is one of the few people that have the courage to stop that."
NBE02690,"Some people see him as a hero , but I do not so so. Because leaking of classified information is a serious crime especially in America. America is influential country over the world. Therefore the action of Snowden should not be assessed ""hero"" ."
NBE01524,"I don't think he is a hero. I think every country has some top secrets, so officers shouldn't reveal them. Because it may lose the country's reputation. I want to ask him the reason why he revealed."
NBE01789,"I think Edward Snowden is a hero. It is surely bad to steal information of the state secret. However the action uncovered the injustice that the United States performed and announced it to the world, and became an opportunity to let us think about importance of the information and national trust. In addition to it he abandoned a previous living to leak information. For such a reason, I think that his action was right."
NBE01453,"I cannot judge whether Edward Snowden is a hero or a traitor. Some people think he is a hero. Others think he is a traitor. Leaking US information is bad thing, but I think this action may be indispensable for the society. Everything has many aspects like this news. Especially, the national matter like this cannot be judged easily."
NBE01572,"I think he is a traitor. For some people, what the US government did was shocking, but for others, it could be predicted. These days, there are many surveillance cameras around us and anyone's private information can be accessed. We often open our privacy to a whole world by ourselves such as uploading pictures and writing blogs. In such an information-oriented society, protecting the nation from terrorists could be a right reason to keep watching information. Turning to Edward Snowden, he took out classified information out of the US. His action may expose American citizens to danger. This is the opposite to of the purpose of the US government. That's why I think he is a traitor."
NBE01503,"After I read this article, I thought that Snowden is hero. According to the law, the freedom of speech is guaranteed. In addition Snowden is so brave. It is also the condition to be a hero."
NBE01912,"I don't agree with the idea that the number of spy will decrease. It is true that most intelligence are gathered by the Internet. However, secret national intelligence couldn't be gathered by the Internet because a lot of governments may be on the watch for cyber attack. I think the most important intelligence might be gathered by human beings."
NBE01307,"I don't agree with you. Don't regard this matter as emotional matter. Nobody knows why he leaked the information. , but his actions clearly endangers the US itself. As long as the country has the biggest power around the world, you should care about the bad effect that caused the leak."
NBE01286,"No matter how he praised as a hero, no matter how morally right his action was, as a result, it is illegal and he should not bring the classified information out. Some say that what NSA did itself is illegal, but the US court must treat this as ""political question"". In any way, Snowden has no escape, but his action surely arouses public opinion. It must judges what NSA have done."
NBE02244,"I am opposed to this opinion. The United States is a leading country in the world. If not all countries are equal, they will not be nice. It is not allowed just because it is a strong country."
NBE02612,"I regard Edward Snowden as a traitor. His exposure endangered US people. For example, he exposed that NSA hacked China. This damaged the human rights diplomacy, which US made for China. The relations between US and China are so important for the all countries because two countries have the mighty influence on them in various aspects, such as the military, economy, and politic. Therefore, his act worsened the relations between two countries and endangered not only US people but also all people in the world."
NBE02187,"I think he is hero. He leaks secret information of The US . Leaking information is illegal, but that information is unacceptable. By Snowden, we know the way of the US to collect information. However, he can't go back to the US."
NBE02188,"I can't agree the opinion. Snowden escaped in several countries, but I think he don't regret leaking. He may be under sentence of death penalty in The US, so he must run away."
NBE01857,"I think that he is a hero because he searched a lot of information it is US's secret and unacceptable . I also think that to leak information without being permitted is wrong, but I guess he wanted us to know how US is."
NBE01699,"Now, Edward Snowden is the person much talked about, and there are both side which praise him and which blame him. Actually, I don't know about it with many details and whether he is a hero or a traitor. It seem to be a right action, but some says that it put American at risk. However, I respect the way of Snowden's acting. He did it because he believed it right, though it won't be profitable for himself but risky. I can't think of revealing some national important information, but I do want to live with my belief."
NBE01959,"I think Edward Snowden is traitor. Edward Snowden leak top secrets of NSA. Certainly, if NSA listened in on EU and China's information, it is illegal. But it is higher politic issue. So this news is controversial now. USA's secret service is not permitted. But Edward Snowden isn't also permitted."
NBE02481,"I think Snowden is traitor. Certainly, impeaching with intelligence by CIA has a few good points. But also an obligation to keep official secrets is important for society. I think intelligence by CIA in this case isn't problem that have to impeaching. This impeaching has only bad influence upon America. This impeaching is for him rather than society."
NBE01262,"Before I read this article, I didn't know Snowden. So I surprised when I read this article. And I think Snowden is traitor. Because I think there are lots of informations which should be keeped in the world and I think this information is the one which have to be keeped. So I think he is traitor."
NBE01882,"I can't agree to this comment completely. Information may be more and more gathered on ""the Internet world"", but the security against this new world must be more and more strengthened. And of course, the secret of each country won't be leaked so easily. So the spy like what they are now will be remained and will continue to have the importance."
NBE01883,"I think he is both hero and traitor. Of course he broke the low, and it is absolutely bad thing. But also this age of international society needs the action like him."
NBE01643,"I do not know much about this news, however, I think he is a traitor. It is true that his behavior has some positive effects on the US citizen, however he spoiled the US national interest. I guess he is a betrayer. The US government should punish him severely."
NBE02167,"I think Edward Snowden is a traitor because the government will not abuse any information they research. He let out the important secret information all over the world, in spite of the fact that he was the former CIA employee, which is disgraceful for American society."
NBE01840,I agree with ID13023's idea. I also regard Edward as his being a hero. It is because he provided us with information.
NBE02532,"I think Snowden is both a traitor and a hero. I don't decide which I should agree. On one side, he broke the low and it is not forgiven as a American citizen. But other side, he is so brave because he leaked it at the risk of his life."
NBE01289,"I don't agree with you. Don't regard this matter as emotional matter. Nobody knows why he leaked the information. , but his actions clearly endangers the US itself. As long as the country has the biggest power around the world, you should care about the bad effect that caused the leak."
NBE02436,"I think Snowden is a traitor. I can understand he was so brave, but I don't think to leak secret informations of NSA was meaningful. Because, I think his actions threatened the state and citizens. The activities of NSA is for protect the nation from terrorism. Regardless it is justice or not, there are some truth which is better not to know in the world."
NBE01343,"As for his action, it would be so careless in terms of his position. maybe it is caused of exposing his nation to danger. I can't praise for his behavior, but I agree with his opinion. According to the news, the embassy was bugged by American government. He probably couldn't excuse such movement. I also think it too exceeding and his action is right."
NBE01814,"I think Edward Snowden is a traitor. As he is a member of CIA, he shouldn't leak the information of the nation. CIA has keeped secrets, so U. N. can conduct state affairs smoothly. If the member of a national information betrays the government like him, people in the country will be confused and it can't maintain public order. He should have known the influence of U. N. and been aware of his responsibility as a member of CIA."
NBE01750,"I don't think him as a hero, because some international problems can be visible ones due to him. International conflicts can turn into wars, which makes people unhappy. He touched the problems which should be untouched, so I don't agree with you."
NBE01751,"I agree with you. He violated the most important principle to keep the secrets as a CIA employee, so we cannot value him high."
NBE01549,"I agree with you. Countries must protect its secrets information. Although fundamental human rights should not be ignored, but I think interests of a country is more important because only countries make sure that people live peaceful lives."
NBE01478,"Seeing from American government and CIA, he would be a traitor. And in fact, he is a criminal. But I'd like to praise the courage of his that do not care about the risk for the sake of justice."
NBE01597,"It is true that Edward Snowden commit a crime, I think he did right thing seeing from moral point. From American view point, his action was guilty. But from Korean and Chinese view point, his action was innocent."
NBE02402,"I agree with ID13021 when he says Snowden has caused visible conflicts around the world. It can be said that a gulf has formed between Russia and the US To eliminate unnecessary conflict globally, we should keep some information on our own."
NBE01851,"I think that he is a hero. It is a crime surely to steal confidential information. However, Edward who gave the information which should be given to people is a hero. The secret of a country needs to be known by people. So that the secret is large. Edward is brave."
NBE02038,"I think Snowden urged us to reconsider. What are information, privacy, national secret. . . ? It's perplexing problem. With the advance of the Internet, the amount of information is increasing and our privacy is decreasing I think. I don't know what is correct and what is important about our privacy and national interests. In this way, I think Snowden is a HERO because we could notice our life are watched by SOMEONE."
NBE02339,I really shocked about this news. This is because the government which need to safe the right of privacy harmed citizens. They harmed citizens right is really annoying thing. I can't imagine that. So this news was really shocking news for me and I can't believe.
NBE01815,"I don't agree with you. He is not in a position to leak the nation's information. If U. N. allow him to do it, people who do the same thing will increase. As he broke the low, he should be published."
NBE01455,I cannot agree with his opinion. We cannot judge whether he is a hero or a traitor. It is very difficult matter.
NBE01816,"I agree with you. Even the people can get the information that has been secret, the risk of leaking is bigger problem than its advantage."
NBE02299,I disagree with your opinion. Because secrecy of a country should not be leaked in any situations.
NBE02456,"snowden should be punished. Even if there are some reasons, it is illegal."
NBE01346,"I agree with you. Edward Snowden 's action is right. His action is caused by cruel espionage by American government. Not to expose his nation danger. Recently, American government is chasing him persistently. I want him to run away from them."
NBE02792,"I think Snowden is a hero. Certainly he broke the law, but excessive nationalism is bad for people and a accuser is necessary."
NBE02793,I agree with your opinion. I think he is courageous too.
NBE02794,I disagree with your opinion. The laws are not always right.
NBE01631,"I agree with the opinion that Snowden is hero. If I stood on his situation, I would choose my safety. I became to have more respect to Snowden after reading this comment."
NBE01632,I think his act was right. It is right that he broke the low but low is not always justice and his decision to leak the information is justice I think. His act saved the ordinary people's safe and the right to know the political things.
NBE01768,I think he is a traitor and criminal. The media report as if he were a great hero - he sacrificed lover and money and steady life for his conscience. But in the first place he violated the law. The people in the US have duty to obey the domestic law. His act can leads to disorder so we cannot value him as a hero.
NBE01779,"I agree to your opinion. He violated the law to cause visible conflicts. What he did is not acceptable. A huge disorder may take place in the future because of him, so we cannot praise him as a hero."
NBE01780,"I don't agree with you. Whatever the motive is, we must not permit violating laws when seemingly having proper reasons, then the system of legislation would be no longer respectable."
NBE06414,"I regard him as his being a hero. He did the treason act of leaking US information but I think that international society also needs those who can do action. It may be caught by the United States, so I want him to escape from the United States."
NBE02898,"This affair occupied many people's interests. He gave us the opportunities which we think about NSA's true character. Without his leak, citizens wouldn't pay attention to importance of keeping secrets. In that respect, his action is admirable, so I think he is our hero."
NBE05702,"Of course, he is traitor because he broken the law But he is a hero too. In fact, there are quiet a few people who welcomed his leak. What should be careful about this case is what we don't too much admiration for him."
NBE06995,He is hero because he disclosed NSA's ill indeed and gave many people opportunities of thinking better of keeping personal information. It is that he USA was put on risk by his disclosure. But he must not be regarded as traitor
NBE01550,"It is unfair that Italy is only responsible for this accident . It is a problem of every country. I think that the biggest cause of this kind of accidents is the difference of wages between Europe and Africa. Also I think the unemployment rate and poverty of Africa are the reasons of this problem. To solve this problem fundamentally, wage differences between countries must be corrected. To achieve that, we should pay more attention on the UN or the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly etc, and should make every effort to form international community where every people can live comfortably and happily."
NBE02272,"I was surprised second times at this news. First, capsize of the boat occurs in the reality. I think it is the accident only in movie and comics. Second, the number of bodies which rescue workers recovered amazed me. Saving 111 lives is so wonderful thing!!!"
NBE01646,"I strongly believes that the best way to prove this problem is that European countries and African countries corporate and work together. Maybe, the Africans who died in this accident was so called ""illegal immigrant. "" Illegal immigration is a serious problem in many European countries. Also, it is not good for African countries that their people go foreign countries."
NBE02769,"I was very surprised at contents of this news. I think the reason why immigration occur is that most African migrant did not satisfied with their life in Africa. Therefore, European countries should support African who endure poor life. Naturally, African countries have to effort to develop their economy."
NBE02388,"This news made me realize hard facts of the situation in the developing world in our time. There are still many people who found themselves in difficulty in their home countries. For example, people are suffering from a food shortage, unfavorable terms of employment, or the spread of terrible diseases. Moreover, I have recently heard that some women who have moved to the developed world do not want to go back for the reason of the frequency of sex crimes over there. I think refugees should be accepted more because they have no choice but to move away to more comfortable countries to live. It is not right for us to blame them for escaping from their countries without trying to help them find happiness, just because entering other countries with no permission is illegal. It is natural that they have a right to have better lives like we do in Japan, isn't it? If you say that the number of migrants has to decrease, I think you should contribute to them get comfortable life. For example, you can start a fundraising campaign, or be a member of some kinds of NGO to support developing countries in supplying what they need and maintaining public order. If more people do so, thousands of migrants who may die making the journey to developed countries could be saved."
NBE01678,"I was very surprise to read the news. I have a question that why the migrant boat caught fire. I think that if a boat sinks, I will die in an instant because I cannot swim. I really realized how wonderful rescue workers are and I think that things were better that many people were rescued."
NBE02744,"The headline reminded me 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami because there are also still many missing people in the sea. However, there is a difference, too. While the earthquake couldn't have avoided by human, the shrinking could have been prevented. The article said that this kind of accidents had been often happened before. Because of this, I hope the international community will take urgent action. The victims must have been looking to make a brighter future for themselves in Europe. I hope no more Africans will die on the way to Europe. I pray their soul may rest in peace."
NBE02484,"It is difficult that solve a problem of refugee. Because Long as there is war and poverty in the world, refugee born. When does the war for resources, land, and ideology end? Or does it never go away? We shouldn't think that peace of Japan continue forever."
NBE02366,"This accident is said to be the worst in a series of accidents that have occurred in the Mediterranean, so I was surprised when I heard this news. It is not only producing numerous victims, but highlighting the problem about illegal immigrant. The problem of illegal immigrant is a perplexing issue in the decision-making process of the EU, but the accident should be used as an opportunity to consider the problem of immigrant and I want the EU to approach a solution."
NBE01990,"I was surprised to hear that. This accident is so devastating that I think there are no survivors. However, at least 155 people could be survived. This is because rescue workers did things which they should do. This is good."
NBE01991,"I was surprised to hear that. This accident is so devastating that I think there are no survivors. However, at least 155 people could be survived. This is because rescue workers did things which they should do. This is good."
NBE01575,"I am very sorry for migrants' death in this accident. I am afraid but I've never heard that thousands of migrants have tried to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Europe, and have died many times. Regarding this accident, I wonder why people living in the island of Lampedusa didn't help the migrants on the burning boat, since it sank only half a mile from the shore. If they tried to help migrants, more people would have been rescued. Migrants escape from their home countries as they cannot live there stably because of internal conflicts, poverty and tyranny by their governments. However, for European countries, it is very difficult to accept all the migrants every year. I hope that African countries will have democratic governments and people could live happily in their home countries so that there will be no one who wants to escape by crossing the Mediterranean."
NBE02067,"When I saw this news, I thought it's happened in Middle Ages. A TV program said in the past, slaves had carried to Europe using small boat. The Blacks were forced, very bad circumstance, there were no toilet, no space to sleep and no something to eat. Further, the boat sunk frequently. I think nothing is changed. We repeat same mistakes many times. We have to solve this issue. This issue is not only Italy's. I think developed country have to aid developing countries."
NBE02120,"It's a pity thing that many African people died. To avoid such a tragedy, it's important to offer the good working places in Africa. Moving to the developed countries may cause the same thing someday again. I think developed countries should help the developing countries in Africa (of course, not only in Africa but also all over the world), and should treat them equal terms with the rich."
NBE02146,"I think this problem is very difficult to solve. However, the government must be careful for the migrants to stop the accident like this. The migrants will be big power to solve working problem of nation. So, we treated them important, equal. We should accept them and exist together in the same society."
NBE02639,I felt sad when I knew this news. Over 100 parsons were killed in this accident. A lot of Africans need job and want to move to Europe. This problem might lead to happen this devastating accident. I think European and African countries need to consider this accident and do some effort not to happen such a accident again.
NBE02720,"When I read this article, I felt sad and was surprised. But I thought that there is not 100% safety in the real world. So, we need to reduce the possibility of happening terrible accident such as the accident appearing in this article. I want to praise the rescue workers who saved about 160 people and want them to carry out measures immediately."
NBE02509,"I was surprised to hear the news and felt sad. The reason why the accident happened is the migrant worker problem, in my opinion. A lot of unemployed people in Africa often come to Europe illegally in order to get job. Each year swells the rank of the unemployed in the world. So European countries also have to accept the migrant with restraint to raise their own employment rate. I think this problem is not only European but also African problem. Of course, European governments make efforts to accept more migrant, however African governments should work hard to supply the more environment of a workplace. In short, both European and African countries have to solve this problem."
NBE01616,"I think the most important aim of the voyages are to get jobs. A lot of Africans who don't have jobs go to Europe in order to get jobs. In order to solve this problem, the European countries and African countries should cooperate each other. For example, European enterprises advance into Africa and offer employment opportunity and African government should make safer society. In any case, to prevent the tragedy the international cooperation is essential"
NBE01792,"I was very surprised by this news story because I didn't know this news. To begin with, I didn't know even that emigrant activity from Africa to Italy was carried out. I think that the African countries which produce many migrants without being able to feed the nation are responsible for this accident. It is a minimum duty as the countries to keep the life of the nation"
NBE02094,"This news is too sad, tragedy. The migrants have done all the effort to get out from their plight but finally ended in vain. Tragedy after tragedy. Their effort was unrewarded. However there are nobody to blame on, I think. The accident may have been avoided but the situation was difficult to deal, difficult to predict, difficult to react immediately indeed. That makes me feel more and more complicated."
NBE02589,"The accident was caused by the people made light of Africans. Clearly, we should take an action to realize the brighter future of them. At first, we should help them for example financially to live comfortably in their countries. And secondly, we mustn't desert all the people defecting to our countries."
NBE01525,I was very surprised to hear this news. Because over 200 migrants were killed in this accident. I think the Council of Europe's parliamentary should make sincere effort to prevent similar accidents . And furthermore to solve the difference of wages between Europe and Africa is also necessary.
NBE02665,"I was very surprised to see this news in last week's class because that I hadn't heard this news before. Unfortunately, we often hear this kind of tragedies around the world. I strongly agree with Jean-Claude Mignon's statement, which says about the improvement of all the situations. In addition, I want to claim that sailors, who actually take the handle of vessels should think of safety more. Of course, the governments should make some changes of system, but I think sailors themselves also hold problems."
NBE02300,"When I heard this news, I was very surprised. Because I could not imagine such things. I think more and more people could be alive. If people made effort to protect from such things. So we should learn from such things."
NBE01938,It is difficult that solve a problem. I think that this problem is not responsibility only for Italy. This incident is affected poverty in Africa. It is necessary for the global community to cooperate. And Japan should do more movement.
NBE01336,I think there is not 100% safety place in the real world. That thought is shocking. But it informed me of our life that is next to danger. We should make more safety society for myself.
NBE01319,"I became very sad when I read this article. In terms of law, it cannot be forgave that migrants were killed. Some problem, race and skin color, make people think that ""we"" are not same with ""them"" in spite of the fact that we are all human beings. In this case, these bias may have one responsibility to this tragedy. Although this problem might have been in for long time, we have mission to remove that bias."
NBE02562,"The migrant went on their journey for getting the peace place, but their hope has come to an end such as tragedy. Any accident occurs without purpose and suddenly. So I think that the responsibility of this tragedy doesn't belong to Italy, European countries and any European organization. What they can do next is to learn a lesson from this and never to repeat such happenings, for example, keep the rescuers going into action as soon as possible."
NBE01817,"I think if we pass over this problem of migrants, we would make repeated same mistakes. Now we must discuss what to do about it all over the world. This accident happened in Italy this time, but there is a possibility of happening in other countries. It is important that many countries have senses of impending crisis. What we can do for victims of the accidents is to learn from history, change the environment and solve the problem."
NBE01481,"I think that Southern Europe countries should accept a refugee as much as possible. On the other hand, I think that not only to help a refugee but also to reduce the refugee through the support for Africa are required of developed countries."
NBE01914,"I was very shocked when I heard the news. When I was a high school student, I knew the fact that some Africans went to Europe though they run risks in dying. The causes of the action are conflicts and the corruption of the government. So the UN should solve those problems."
NBE01456,I was surprised to read this news. I cannot imagine such an awful thing. I hope people in Italy can live safely. Africa and Italy try to prevent accident like this and solve this problem. The governments should make effort to solve this accident and other accident like this.
NBE01241,"I was surprised at this news. Because I think it is very scary to die to sink. A lot of people is sinking, now. I hope to be discovered. When I was at the age of 10, I went to sea. Of course I went into water, and played. I was drown. It was very scary."
NBE01729,"I felt so sad to hear the news. Why those poor migrants couldn't make good journey though such tragedy could easily prevented? And why they had to be caught fire and capsized off? People all have equal rights. And even though they are poor, they have the freedom of journey and safety. And it mustn't exist to attack such poverty at any time."
NBE01841,"I was surprised for me to read a report. It is because the correspondence to a refugee is severe. I think that a refugee is not lost unless war is lost. Is argument lost? I think that war is not lost by me. Because, people are since he wants profits. We must not pursue only our profits."
NBE01964,"I think that government of Eritrea and Somalia are responsible for this tragedy. In stable government, people will not migrate abroad. Eritreans and Somalis can't help migrating to Europa with dangerously overcrowded and unseaworthy vessels . Because they hope to live in peace area. We can do nothing about this problem until immigrants go through the border between Africa and Europa. This tragedy is difficult to be stamped out."
NBE02536,Immigrant from Africa to Europe has caused my arguments. Many immigrants come to Europe risking their life. In order to make these problems not happen we need to make Africa richer so that Africans won't have to risk their lives to make a living. International cooperation is indispensable in order to solve this issue.
NBE01424,This was a terrible accident. I think governments of Eritrea and Somalia should try to reduce the number of people who migrate from these countries. The reason why so many people try to migrate is the bad condition of their own country. So I think the government of Eritrea and Somalia should try to improve their own country.
NBE01505,We are poor to solve such a racial problem because Japan has only one race. (There are the Ainus and Ryukyuan to be exact. ) So I usually think it is bad to come foreign country to work for migrants. But every country isn't peaceful and rich. So every migrant doesn't want to work foreign country. It is so difficult for human being to solve an international problem. But we never get really peaceful without solving an international problem.
NBE01864,"I was very sad to hear the news because this accident may be kept. I heard that italian ship came there and went away. This means that this accident should be defended by that ship. I am sorry for hundreds of migrant but i also think this voyage is very high risk and dangerous. So they should think more about the situation and change some systems. For example, to ban the migrant people but it is very difficult. . ."
NBE01375,"I was surprised to ad this news, because I didn't know that such a tragedy often happen. I think migrants make a dangerous because they can't make a living if they do not so and have not enough money to ride a good ship. So, I think surrounded countries should offer help to them."
NBE02274,"I agree your opinion. At first, I thought that migrants are pitied. But, we should not think that the plight of migrants is out of the question. Japan may possibly go bankrupt in a few years. We have to be very much aware of the world situation."
NBE02222,"I don't understand why people suffering from serious poverty give births even though it is obvious that their children are going to suffer, too. Relatively rich countries such as European countries cannot afford to save overflowing poor people. When I was in Finland two years ago, the same issue was in crisis. ( And I'm sure it still is. ) My host mother told me that poor immigrants do not work not only because they don't have skills that is needed to work, but also they are lazy. I think they are not used to work before, so they cannot work stably in the same place."
NBE01702,"It's inevitable to happen some tragedy in the world, but I'm so sorry about this time because the case could easily have been prevented. we are living peacefully in Japan, and actually have nothing with people in Africa, so we can live without caring about them. But, the world is becoming more and more global, and we can do very many things we couldn't imagine to do twenty years ago. So I believe that we can even solve the situation in Africa if people in the world cooperate one another to help them. Furthermore, I'm highly expect that the world will continue to progress and make something impossible possible including solving the situation in Africa."
NBE02694,"In Europe , many people from a lot of area live together. Spanish living in Italy , the French living in Russia is an everyday affair. Therefore , this kind of thing can be happened often. I think this kind of problem is difficult to solve."
NBE02615,"I think this miserable accident originates in Immigration issues. In the world as well as Europe, the issues cause so many accidents of this kind, social problems, and even disputes. The root causes of immigration issues lie deep, including historical problems and racial discrimination etc. Therefore, it is so difficult to solve the big issues, but we can solve the accidents kind of this. To solve them, independent organizations, such like UN and NPO, should intervene between immigrant countries. It is also important to increase the number of immigrant countries, including Japan limiting immigrants. Solving seemingly small problems such like this boat accident will finally help us to solve big issues such like immigration issues."
NBE02248,"This accident is a really miserable accident. We have to accept this accident with sincerity. And never don't cause that it is the same as that of future. Therefore, it is necessary to study this incident thoroughly and to knead a preventive measure."
NBE01335,". I sympathize with you. The sentence""there is not 100% safety in the real world"" shocked me and informed me of our life that is next to danger. We should make more safety society for myself."
NBE01326,"I sympathize with you. The sentence""there is not 100% safety in the real world"" shocked me and informed me of our life that is next to danger. We should make more safety society for myself."
NBE01686,"I agree with your opinion. I think that Japanese that live now take it for granted that this country has the peace, but we have to think again about the mistake."
NBE01401,"This news is really miserable. I think this accident has many important problems. For example, people who has taken that boat was illegal immigrants, and they are lived in developing country. So when they need to help to an other country like this situation, the other country will not try to rescue immediately and seriously, because they are illegal immigrants and they are developing people. This fact is really really sad. But this is true I think. I heard that In fact the rescue didn't come as soon as they can. The illegal immigrants is serious problem."
NBE01402,"I agree with you. But it is difficult that many people be member of some kinds of NGO to support developing countries. I just think that many more people know about some international news like this. By doing this, world will start to change."
NBE02594,"I totally agree with you and, what is more, now it is the most important that European countries take migrants more seriously and protect them even if with some requirements."
NBE01866,"I think so too. This accident is very big scale and very scary. Of course, sinking when you played is very scary , but this sinking of the news is more scary. I pray his soul may rest in peace."
NBE02666,"Perhaps this news was not widely broadcast in Japan so many people said in the class that they knew the tragedy for the first time. I think this is a problem. Japanese media should let us know more information around the world such as that accident because the gate from Africa to Europe, the Mediterranean is a significant spot, and over 100 people died there. Of course, Poor migrants always consider big risk to go to other places but we must not ignore the risky situations. Rich countries often rely on the labors from poor countries so they should improve the circumstances around the works as minimal repayment.

Of course, Poor migrants always consider big risk to go to other places but we must not ignore the risky situations. Rich countries often rely on the labors from poor countries so they should improve the circumstances around the works as minimal repayment."
NBE01461,I agree with your opinion. I think the government should consider peace. We should think our country. We should change our world.
NBE02620,"I agree with your opinion. To solve problems of this kind, independent organizations such like UN should impartially intermediate between immigrant countries and emigrant countries. Furthermore, they should sometimes interfere in emigrant countries where people have few jobs and government corrupted."
NBE02023,"I think it is a serious problem. African migrants going to Italian island are increasing. And They go on a jam-packed board. It is danger. I think this accident relates it. And African migrants increasing has two problems. One, Italian population growth rate is rapidly increasing by them. Another, young Italian people has difficulty in catching occupations. So I think African countries and Italy should have the consultation and make some policies."
NBE02802,"I felt quite relieved to know A total of 155 survivors were rescued. However, I was worried about a further 200 people still missing. I hope they will be recovered soon. Moreover, I was sad to think about at least 111 people gone. In order not to cause such a tragedy again, countries all over the world should prepare to accept migrants urgently."
NBE02803,"I agree with you in that it is a problem of every country. In order to make world where every people can live comfortably and happily, every country must try to support poor countries."
NBE02026,"I think it is the accident only in movie and comics"" , this attracted me! I think so! It must not have occurred as your reaction. It is a serious problem has various meanings. From now on, it is on my mind!"
NBE02324,"Most migrations are attributed to the poor living standard in migrants' country. In order to solve this problem, all the European countries should unite and endeavor to improve it. It doesn't matter which European country is most responsible for it."
NBE02342,"I was really surprised about this news. This is because I can't imagine that thousands of migrants tried to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Europe, and have died many times. Also this news make me sad for the immigrants. I think that kind of immigrants are very serious problem. So I think countries should responsible for this problems."
NBE02416,"I was really surprised and felt sad when I read this news. I think that the responsibility of this tragedy doesn't belong to Italy, European countries and any European organization. But there should be something that they can do for the poor people. It must help to solve these problems."
NBE02396,"I like your idea. Although it is difficult for us to solve the migrants' problem, there are still some ways that developed countries can do. One of it may be the cooperation between Europe and Africa."
NBE01889,I was shocked by this news. I think there're many other case like this and are never able to disappeared. We have to face that we are always near the catastrophe of the war or natural disaster.
NBE02421,"I agree with you. I especially like the sentence ""there is not 100% safety in the real world"". That is so true there won't be the completely safe place in the world. But we should keep trying to create better world."
NBE01970,"I don't think so. I think UN should not make an effort to solve this problem but THE african countries should do. Certainly, UN have to work together. But The african countries must play the main role to solve this problem."
NBE01753,"This was so shocking. We many Japanese are rich that we can live with no need of change of situations around us. But on other sides of the world, some people have to change something to live on, disregarding danger. But I think the migrants themselves are responsible for this tragedy because no one wouldn't have forced them to take the dangerous journey."
NBE01627,I agree with you. European countries should support African.
NBE01291,"The news can potentially happen every countries in Europe. There are so many migrants in the area, so this is high time started to discuss the problems about migrants. I think countries should accept them because a country isn't for the natives of a country."
NBE01738,I think so too!! All African people doesn't want to move to European Countries . So they must accept Africans.
NBE02807,"I agree with you in that it is a problem of every country. In order to make world where every people can live comfortably and happily, every country must try to support poor countries."
NBE02257,"I think so too. Rescue workers did very good things. The news was very sad news, but I think very good that many people could be survived."
NBE02569,I agree with you. This crisis is very important not only for Italy but also the other nations including Japan. Migrants is one of the biggest problem in the world. We should think this problem again.
NBE02783,"I agree with you. I respect rescue workers, because they saved a lot of life not only in this case. Therefore, I want to support them."
NBE02170,"I was very surprised at contents of this news. I have a question that why the migrant boat caught fire. It is not only producing numerous victims, but highlighting the problem about illegal immigrant. So, we need to reduce the possibility of happening terrible accident such as the accident appearing in this article."
NBE02471,this news is very interesting to me.
NBE02469,"I agree with you. Whether immigrants is good for the country or not, they must do something to help immigrants. Because it is natural to help other people."
NBE02197,"I feel sad and heave a sigh. I can't believe that such a terrible accident happened some times. I think the accident like this time will happen in the future. To prevent it, it is necessary that people make the good relationships between Europe and Africa."
NBE01249,"I disagree with you. Because if people of a lot of countries live together, we can understand a lot of cultures. Let's live with various people"
NBE02198,"I agree with you generally. However, we can't denounce the migrants. I think they are poor and get out of the situation, but they should take another way."
NBE02519,"I agree with your opinion. I think the government should consider about worker problem. It was not only other countries problem but also Japan's problem. In order to be peace, all we have to solve it."
NBE01531,I agree with you too. European countries need to support African. (I couldn't log in my account. )
NBE02045,"I was very surprised at contents of this news. We repeat same mistakes many times and have to solve this issue. In any case, to prevent the tragedy the international cooperation is essential"
NBE02310,"I feel the same feeling, too you. In the future, the same things may happen. So we should have countermeasure."
NBE02031,"I think it is the accident only in movie and comics , this attracted me! I think so! It must not have occurred as your reaction. It is a serious problem has various meanings. From now on, it is on my mind!"
NBE01350,"This is very sad news. I wonder why such tragedy accidents occur continuously? In fact, we can't feel it is real because it occurs another place where we can't see. We just try to avoid happening same accident again."
NBE01764,"Giving economic support the poor is nothing other than the rich's self-satisfaction. Only under the situation the European countries are suffered by immigrants, they should support them not to let them in. So partly I agree with you."
NBE01846,"I agree with you. It is because international cooperation is required to solve such a problem. However, Japan cares about aggravation of a relation with a foreign country, and has not done good correspondence to the foreign country. Japan had better let an opinion pass more."
NBE02547,"I agree with you. To solve problem like this, European countries should support African who endure poor life."
NBE01440,"when I hear this news, I feel sad. We should do something if we can prevent such terrible accident. In my opinion, governments of Eritrea and Somalia should try to reduce the number of people who migrate from these countries. So many people try to migrate is the bad condition of their own country. So I think they should try to improve their own country."
NBE01269,I felt very sad when I heard this news. I hope that accident like this will not happened anymore
NBE01490,"I agree with you. I think that there is some responsibility to Europe in the refugee problem in Africa, but it is not the only cause. In addition, I think that before bring a charge, saving lives to cooperate in each country is important."
NBE01302,"I agree with you. No matter how serious the cause of the accident are, the life of the people is invaluable. I feel the same as you."
NBE01598,"I thought that this is tragic accident. Generally, passengers riding the immigrant boat are economically weak peoples. They forced to ride the boat for themselves and their families. But by this accident, not only victims but also their families will be suffered. Such accident should not occur again."
NBE01605,"I think so, too. It is not easy thing to rescue people from firing boat. It is very brave action."
NBE02900,"I would like two to describe this incident. One is that I was reminded of the South Korean passenger ship sinking accident. A difference of two incidents is both a sad incident but only the point that the victim was illegal immigration. As for Japan where another of low birthrate and longevity have been a problem, an immigration problem often becomes the center of attention for an increase in population. In that case, Japan has to take in immigration positively rather. . . . As for us the Japanese, this incident may not be every others."
NBE02899,"I approve of homosexuality marriage. It is because one of my friends is bisexual. It is because she only calls it a woman and changes no objects taking to it to us. However, the sexual act between persons of the same sex causes a venereal disease of AIDS or others. Someday, Japan will also face this problem. We have to consider this problem deeply then."
NBE06138,"I think this problem must be urgently resolved. That more immigrants die by such accident would adversely affect both Europe and Africa. And, I think this problem is that both Europe and Africa must be efforts to solve the problem. By doing so, countries in the region will also be on to cooperate."
NBE05115,I became very sad when I read this article. This accident is very terrible. And it is very difficult to solve. But I don't think only Italy has the responsibility of this tragedy. We all must think how to solve this problem deeply because it is the gate of Europe and a lot of people are using it.
NBE07327,"I did not know this kind of sad things still happen today. To me, tragedies while going to new land is just something seen in history textbook as there used to be a lot of people sacrificed in some eras. I hope no accident will occur for people who are really excited to move to new place to start a new life."
NBE05488,"I've forgot or haven't known this tragedy news. Even though circumstances are different, it reminds me of 3.11, which people flown in the sea by Tsunami. But I don't really understand why Human rights become problem if migrants sunk in Europe. ."
NBE07150,"When I read this news for the first time, I remembered Great East Japan Earthquake. This disaster plunged us into fear and sorrow. A lot of people were died and spread in the tsunami. If people who could survive, most of them lost their home. By this news, there are still many people who found themselves in difficulty in their home countries. They must be suffering from a food shortage, unfavorable terms of employment, or the spread of terrible diseases. So, I think we should be accepted more refugees because they have no ways to survive and choice to move away to more comfortable countries to live. Even Japan is a country with many disasters and does not know when we fall into such situation. At that time, how about if other countries do not send us to the country at all? it is important to think about it how I want it if it is oneself if a partner is in trouble. I think we can say this not only a person to a person but also a country to country."
NBE02486,"Long as there is an issue of rich and poor, migrant workers will not disappear. Worker is treated like a machine. They get the money instead of life. Managers want only profit, and forget that workers are human. We should notice something important than profit."
NBE02275,"When I reading the news, I remember the Jewish asylum. Being forced to work in up to 50 C heat, with little water and no air-conditioning in the home is the very life of a slave. It's a pure anachronism. Because we live in affluent circumstances, we tend to think that starvation and the death of fatigue is virtual thing. But, the benefits of the Industrial Revolution are not given to every people."
NBE02368,"When I heard this news, I think there is luck of press freedom. Qatar government said ""Number of dead is exaggerated. ""and denied media reports of labor situation, as long as taking their toll, I think getting attach to the number is crazy. Qatar government accepts this case as read seriously and should take a proactive stance on problems in labor environment. Otherwise Qatar is not said the nation fit to host FIFA World Cup."
NBE02147,"Many people look forward to 2022 FIFA World Cup. However, it should not be held by immolating Nepalese laborers. FIFA World Cup and The Olympics are often called as the symbol of peace and friendship. But, they may be only the festival of money basically. We should think ""Which is more important, the fun of sports or the life of laborers?"" Of course, the answer is clear."
NBE02390,"Nepalese workers came to Qatar to earn their families' living, so I think it is inevitable that they suffer from bad conditions. I would predict that many Nepalese people are living in poor surrounding in their home countries as well, and it is not good for them to send back to Nepal either. In order to solve this problem, I think NGOs or some sort of international organizations should help Nepalese get better life in their country."
NBE01617,"I am sad to read the article. One of the important purposes of the international sports meet is to promote mutual friendship between the countries, I think. Of course the World Cup is not an exception. So the fact that many people are dying behind that purpose is so ironic. To solve the problem, the transparency of the process of the construction should be released and if needed, the other countries should cooperate to improve the work environment."
NBE02107,"I was surprised to hear the news. I didn't think of those plight that many people dye because of the world cup. The anticipated number of people who dye until 2020 is also shocking. The number shows how the environment of the workers is horrible. Every time we hear of a big event(like world cup ) hosted in developing country(like Qatar) maybe we should imagine that there will be a huge number of people who work in a plight, just like this case."
NBE02095,"was surprised to hear the news. I didn't think of those plight that many people dye because of the world cup. The anticipated number of people who dye until 2020 is also shocking. The number shows how the environment of the workers is horrible. Every time we hear of a big event(like world cup ) hosted in developing country(like Qatar) maybe we should imagine that there will be a huge number of people who work in a plight, just like this case."
NBE01819,"The problem of labor circumstances should be shown and other countries should recognize it. Such a problem is difficult to be seen by others. Qatar may take an action to it by the criticism from all over the world. In the first place, World Cup is the event that all people enjoy joining. The player and the spectator don't want to think that the labors die because of it and the family of victim would be sad every year of Would Cup. All labors must be treated as a person who has human rights."
NBE02122,"The tournament would not be ""built on the blood of innocents"". I think it is correct. The purpose of the World Cup is not only watching heated games, but also making contribution to the development of the host country. For Qatar, hosting the World Cup is effective in economy. And a lot of profits can be gained. However, in the process of the World Cup (for example making infrastructures) , worker's right should be saved."
NBE02301,"I wonder for what to ignore the problem of workers leading to death by overwork many, to hold the Olympic Games. The government must improve the working environment. And, I think that we should consider the human rights of human beings. Without regard to human rights, I am against the Olympic Games to be held."
NBE01915,I think it is a very serious problem. Other countries which hold the Olympic Games and the World Cup would do the same thing. It is because they have to build stadiums though they don't have enough time. So they tend to force migrant workers to work harshly.
NBE02746,"Such perilous conditions is sad news for me because I think the FIFA World Cup should be entertainment for everyone. However, at the same time, I am ashamed of having fun watching the game without knowing such bad conditions. I don't want 4, 000 people to die before the 2022 FIFA World Cup. I hope the Qatari Government will immediately support workers who went there to work and send money back to their poor families."
NBE02772,This article make me feel sad. A lot of migrant labor work so hard to build infrastructure for the 2022 World Cup. I doubt whether World Cup which cause many migrant labor die is really important. I think the place held World Cup should be changed.
NBE01995,"I was very surprised to hear that. Trade unionists and human rights campaigners have forced the world to recognize the plight of Nepalese laborers in Qatar, who have to work ""like slaves"". This is not good thing. This country have to change the way."
NBE01705,"I felt sad to read this article. The world cup is what originally bring us peace and happiness, but it's actually leading many tragedies. I believe that people in the present time can use the greatest technology ever and help one another in the world if we try, so we should do them. I want our country Japan to be one of leaders to achieve them, and hopefully, I do want to make a contribution to it in the future. To make it true, I must study much including English, experience a lot and think carefully and widely."
NBE02490,I agree with your opinion. The power of sport can be made world peace. But victims for sports are not allowed. Such a sport does not make sense.
NBE01776,Many people look forward to holding FIFA World Cup in 2022. But I think it should not be held by people who work in serious environment. Preferably other country should send on a voluntary assistance. I think course on the way not only the results but is also very important.
NBE01380,"I was surprised and felt sad when I read this article. It is regret that the event everybody should enjoy is realized on sacrifice. I think that such a case happened in various countries so far. However, I thought that such a tragedy should have disappeared as the years go by. Something like worker association and labor standards supervision place starts and longs that the labor circumstances of people is kept. In addition, I think that other countries should help with the establishment, if necessary. I hope that something like worker association and labor standards supervision place starts and a working condition is protected by them. In addition, I think that other countries should help with the establishment , if necessary ."
NBE02224,"I am sad to read this news. I thought international events such as World Cups or the Olympics make severe economical situation better. There are many migrants suffering from slavery labor for those events. This is like we , who live in developed countries, are the privileged classes in the old days exploiting slaves to have fun. I feel sorry for the migrants."
NBE02225,A voluntary assistance is a good idea that I did not come up with.
NBE01681,"I think that it is cruel and I feel sad to read this news. That is certain for sure , holding World Cups or Olympic Games bring a profit all the aspects. But it is necessary to put worker's in substance shoes. I think it should be make things better."
NBE01578,"I believed that holding World Cup had a good effect on a host country as it needs construction of many buildings, infrastructure and transportations and that this gave a great chance to get a job to people both in the host country and in the countries around it. On the other hand, it didn't come to my mind that migrant workers had been forced to work under a very bad condition. The Qatar 2022 supreme committee should improve the working condition immediately. In addition, it must compensate workers and their families for their injuries and deaths with sufficient money. I hope that benefits of hosting World Cup 2022 will be shared by as many people as possible."
NBE01462,"I was sad to hear that news. Nepalese workers came to Qatar to earn money. it is bad that Nepalese work in bad condition to held 2022 FIFA World Cup. Many people are looking forward to 2022 FIFA World Cup. However, FIFA World Cup has sad background. Sports festival like this is a symbol of peace. I hope many people in the world enjoy national sports festival. Sports festival can be a ray of hope."
NBE02515,"I felt so sad to hear the news because I am really looking forward to The Qatar 2022 World Cup. The World Cup is the most international soccer tournament held every four years. Host country have to make efforts to prepare in order to succeed it. Of course, host country have the duty that all thing must be prepared by 2022. However, nepalese workers were dead because of bad condition. The government must take action quickly to solve the worker problem and reconsider the way to prepare it. . The real success of the World Cup is that not only host country but also any other countries can really enjoy it without sad accidents, in my opinion."
NBE02672,"Forced labor under the bad conditions such as heat and no water is a heinous crime which one uses only his power. A rule by using one's power doesn't have legitimacy, so we should prohibit this kind of rule. However, I believe the huge arrangement of infrastructure for World Cup has a positive impact on a host country as a result. And I want to focus only on football at World Cup, tournament management should not be conspicuous."
NBE01331,"I felt sad to read this article. Some times, it is said that FIFA World Cup is the symbol as world's peace and friendship. In spite of this, the situation is the reverse. In order to make FIFA World Cup fun for every one, we should change this situation. For this, first thing we can do is knowing more problem."
NBE02343,I felt so sad to hear this news. This is because World Cup is the symbol of world's peace and friend ship. Also a lot of people are looking forward it. I think one of the problem about it is the luck of freedom. I think human rights should be protected. So that we should try to change the situation now.
NBE01560,"I think that the World Cup can make one's country's economy better. However, cases like this news often happens. Host country must finish preparation of facilities which are needed to hold soccer event, but sometimes it is difficult to do it for host country itself. Therefore, FIFA should give money or other things so that workers can work in safe conditions."
NBE02702,"Generally , we think Qatar is the rich country. So , this news surprises at me. I think the government should bridge the gap between the rich and the poor."
NBE01754,This news article reminded me of the female workers in the time from Meiji to Showa era. They also worked in severe conditions and low wages to help their family's lives. So I'm so shocked and surprised at this news because I hardly have thought that the problems like this are still taking place now in 21 century. I hope this horrible situation would improve as soon as possible.
NBE02568,"When I read this headline, It gave me big shocking. Before I know this topic, my image for World Cup is only enjoying the playing the soccer. But actually it is not true. Behind people's joy, many poor people are forced to work at bad situation. I think we should be hold World Cup with the way everyone is happy."
NBE02725,"When I read this article, I feel really sad. We can always live our lives in comfortable. So we may not imagine this condition correctly. But for them urgent action is necessary. Supply without breaking their life style is important."
NBE02259,"I feel very sad. I like to see FIFA World Cup very much. Word Cup is very good event for me. But I don't agree to hold World Cup in Qatar. I want to change the host country, for example Japan!"
NBE02208,"I think this news is the tip of an iceberg. In Japan, there're news about work. In order to cut labor costs, boss makes hard condition for workers. I think government should soon cope with this problem."
NBE01847,"I agree with you. Because, probably, the manager does not regard them as people. The manager regards them as it being a tool. I am impressed by the World Cup of soccer being held. In practice, if I think that there were a labor problem etc. , I am sad."
NBE01441,"I was really surprised to hear that. Trade unionists and human rights campaigners have forced the world to recognize the plight of Nepalese laborers in Qatar, who have to work ""like slaves"". The truth that some peoples are being worked like slaves is a bad situation, . This country have to change this situation."
NBE01898,"This fact is nothing but catastrophe. Employers no longer see workers as the machine, not the human."
NBE01298,"I think Qatar shouldn't have detained the two Germans because Qatar has a lot of oil and money. It is clear that the labor may start the riot under such a bad condition, but it is also clear that giving the labor a good condition makes us feel good. I'm wondering why Qatar did such action."
NBE01551,"Of course I think drone should not be used. There are three reasons for that. First, I think the users of drones may not feel the sense of killing people. Users of drones do not have to go to the field of war and can live everyday lives after their work. Second, I think that people can trigger wars easily if drones are used because no people of one's own country would die. Third, because of inaccuracy of drones , many civilians are killed indiscriminately. To decrease the use of drones, I think that America must cooperate because America have so many drones. To attain that, UN should try to regulate the power of America in the UN. If that can be achieved, situations may be improved somewhat."
NBE02485,"I have read this article, I remembered the Nintendo War. To kill a lot of people, using missiles feels a guilty feeling less than to kill a human with knife. It would give us a little guilty to kill people even by using unmanned aircraft. Even more it is absurd that citizens became victims. I don't believe in peace which is brought by military power."
NBE02273,"I think drone strikes is the epoch-making method to kill the people, exactly. Because the company can alive by using this method even when we kill a lot of people. So, I understand that the Obama administration escalated the use of it little bit."
NBE01992,"I think it is difficult to decide which is justice about this problem. Drone strikes, UAVs, is the methods the U. S have used in order to counter terrorism. It is not easy for them to replace it by using other means. This problem will be debatable for along time."
NBE01679,"I was surprised at the news. I think that the drone strike is very dangerous weapon. By using drone strikes, many people are killed without difficulty. I also think that why a side that drop bombs on a country that is another side does not talk a matter out with another side before dropping bombs. It is so far to come the peaceful world."
NBE02367,"I was surprised at the case that many citizens has become victim to drone strikes. The report said ""Drones can reduce the damage of citizens depending on how. "", as long as victims of more than 400 people have come up to now, there is no difference to be dangerous. At the same time, a courier service by drones is started in Australia, it is a useful use to reduce costs by using drones. Therefore, we should be considered how to make useful citizens, instead of hurting the citizen."
NBE02745,"Is the use of drone strikes good for peace? When I read this article, such question crossed my mind. Before, my answer to this question was absolutely ""No"" because I didn't think that killing people was the best way to maintain public order. Then, I got confused because I could kind of understand the US argument, reading the article. However, I still have the same answer. We shouldn't use drone strikes so much. I think drone strikes can promote war because they are unmanned weapons. Such weapons may lighten the guilty feeling. Of course, to punish radical terrorist, it sometimes needs to use such weapons, but it had a risk of involving innocent people. That's why I think we should refrain from using drone strikes."
NBE02148,"When I read this news, I remember Three Laws of Robotics. This law tells ""A robot may not harm a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. "" Actually, many people think this law is a fancy. To sum up, a robot can not keep this rule. If we use drone and UAVs, we must be careful about not be out of control."
NBE02389,"I was shocked by reading the following passage. It is said that Pakistan ministry of foreign affairs has records of as many as 330 drone strikes in the country's north-western tribal areas since 2004. Up to 2200 people have been killed of whom at least 400 civilians. Knowing this fact, I do not think drone strikes should be accepted for now. It is because so many innocent people have been killed due to the strikes. I know that they are necessary for Americans to prevent terrorism, but I feel that they should think other ways unless remotely piloted aircrafts are dangerous. Other than that, the American government would be able to use those improved enough to handle safely. For example, American forces can operate some sort of system that predicts unusual situation to prevent attacks scientifically. If science develops more, I believe it could be done."
NBE02221,"Americans love to be a ""hero"" but they need to think about what ""justice"" they are fighting for."
NBE02770,"I think that using drone have both negative point and positive point. First, negative point is guilty conscience. Of course, murder is heavy crime, so people who remote control drone do not kill others directly. As a result, they do not feel guilty conscience. Second, positive point is the number of casualties. Drone is unmanned vehicle. Therefore, if drone was broken, nobody died. In conclusion, I agreed using drone in order to counter terrorism, because it makes the number of casualties decrease."
NBE02096,I really feel frustrated every time I hear of a
NBE02097,"I feel really frustrated when I hear a news or a paradoxical problem related to US military. And that's one of my greatest conscious. Well well indeed , those drones and other military technology shows the nation's power and how great the US is. But that's all. The US haven't gained any other power to solve international issues. The US haven't changed since 9.11 . US should search other way to show the strength of the US."
NBE02563,"I think this problem is not simple and there is no best answer for everyone. The one thinks it is the most important to guarantee the civilian's lives and safety, the other thinks using the drones is only to protect the country and civilians so stopping using them can't allow. It is difficult to use them with no victims. the happening without intentionally can not be avoided. We should find the point of compromise between ""military"" and ""civilian safety""."
NBE01793,"When I read this article, I was very shock. I didn't know that UAV has been made and killed a lot of civilians already. I had thought such a vehicle is not made for a long time. I oppose using such an UAV. Surely the pilots who died by a battle will decrease. However citizen dies as ever, and war will become easy to happen. So I can't agree to it."
NBE01818,"Even if the strike is safer than traditional methods, actually, it made civilian casualties. So the Obama administration can't say it is one of means to counter terrorism. The strike causes damage to citizen and it isn't effective in protecting them. The violence produces the violence again and it is vicious cycle. I think the best way to solve the problem of terrorism is discussion, but it is true that this method is difficult. So America should offer information people need at least. The lack of transparency makes people uneasiness."
NBE02510,"I don't agree with the use of drone strikes. There are two reasons. First, the drone have the lack of judgment. In my opinion, the machine won't judge who are a non-combatant exactly even if it is difficult for human to judge exactly. So the drone will not keep the international law. As a result, a lot of non-combatants may be killed at random by drone. Second, the drone cannot be immune to breakdown. Drone is machine, and nobody knows the time when the machine is out of order. So the drone should not be used."
NBE02721,"I was surprised and terrified by reading this article. America uses the drone strikes under the pretext of counter-terrorism. But actually they use it to make their profit, for instance economical profit. In spite of this situation, more and more American ordinary people lend their hands to the government to do the drone strike. I think they did it like playing game because they cannot see the situation which is attacked by drone strike. In addition, it is so difficult to have sufficient evidence. I think if we do not touch the problem, only America makes their profit and the number of civilian casualties will increase. So, I do not agree with the use of drone strikes and we need measures to deal with the situation soon."
NBE01703,"I'm living peacefully in Japan thinking like no more danger to be involved in some war. I consider the world war two last big one for us, because people in the world experienced the worst tragedy ever. But it doesn't seem to be true. It's possible to happen some tragedy again, actually terrible things are still on in the other part of world, though I haven't experienced but only watched them on TV. We must learn from the past and mustn't repeat mistakes by cooperating one another all around the world. I hope that nowadays' great technology of human such as drone will be used with proper way and the world will be changed better without wars."
NBE02068,"This is so difficult problem. Certainly, it's important to attack without risk of attacker, but it's limited only if attacker is absolute justice. But, there are not such as absolute justice. US and terrorist have a reason to attack somebody. Of course terrorist's reason is unacceptable. I think US is attacking to help civilian, but if they're killing innocent, it's same as terrorism. If drone strike kill many civilian, US have to stop attacks by UAVs. However if US do nothing to these country, many civilians will be killed by terrorist. My opinion, US drone strike is not guilty, but it must stop, and many country (not only US) have to think and act about this problem."
NBE02121,"Even if whatever reasons there is, I think, we should not injure or hurt other people. Drone strikes can injure people easily. The people attack need not go to the front. Of course, I oppose that going to the front and attacking. I hope there would be no arms all over the world."
NBE02590,"I'm afraid that attacks to people steadily escalate because drone strikes are very ""effective"" to kill a lot of people. We can do that very easily by drone, if we hope. It's very awful circumstance. According to the article, in the world, 2200 people have been killed. This number was made by that ""easiness"", I believe. I hope humans stop to pursue it, noticing its awfulness."
NBE01618,I am against to use drones. It is so easy to kill people and the consciousness of killing people is so week when you use drones. It is so terrible that one can kill people without conscience even if casualties are terrorist. I hope the drones will be abolished
NBE01730,"When I read this article for the first time, I was only opposed to the drone strikes and Obama's policy. But after reading your opinion that mentions other good way to use drones, I couldn't help changing my opinion that oppose drones perfectly. But it is natural that the latest skills are always used to injure people. They must understand better way to use such skills."
NBE01939,"It's difficult problem. If a weapon becomes unmanned the dead people of the friend soldier decrease. However, more citizens will die of it. Because as a result, weapons increase. US become in danger to keep peace. I have a doubt to keep peace whether such many weapons are necessary."
NBE01731,"I felt anger with such dangerous weapons and Obama's escalating. Of course such skills are useful and epoch-making. So we can find better way to use them, for example, to make them work in dangerous places like atomic power plants. If we think others each other, we can prevent accidents easily."
NBE01965,"I think this problem is odd. To begin with, I can't understand why many countries permit foreign country's attack. A state have sovereignty. I feel drone's attack infringe sovereignty. But America justify drone's attack by insisting ""world police"". I will not grant the present situation that we can't help depending on America's army power."
NBE01482,"I don't oppose the use of unmanned aircraft. This is because riding a bomber plane long time is dangerous for the pilot. But in this matter, I think the United States is wrong. Whatever reason there is, killing civilians is not allowed absolutely. Drone strike may reduce sacrifice of American soldiers, but the operation should be carried out very carefully."
NBE02640,"Of course, I think the drone must not be used. However, if the war continue, drone might be used because by using drones can save lives of offense side country's soldiers. The war kills both sides people, but they hope nobody get hurt. In order to stop using drones, we must end the war."
NBE01457,"Drone strikes is a weapon to kill a lot of people. This weapon is too dangerous to use. However, drone strikes has many way to be used. People should consider how to use it. Drone strikes can be a device to help people, but it can be also a weapon."
NBE02693,"The way of US sometimes kills a lot of innocent people. Drone can be the tragedy like Iraq War , but if this incident can be justified or not is uncertain. I think this should be carefully watched."
NBE01242,"I think drone strikes had better not be used. But it is an ideal. They are very strong and safe for user. Because pilot is not necessary. So people will use them if government deny them. I think government should limit the size of them or amount of explosive. If do it, damage will be small!!"
NBE01320,"I think American's mention is selfish and not reasonable. In fact, considering of casualty, they don't see the real that are caused by UAVs in drone strikes. In addition, they should recognize that their action violate international humanitarian law. If they think it should be America that lead the world, they have to think what is real safe."
NBE01916,"I think that it cannot help the USA using drone strikes. It is true that drones kill a lot of people. However, they save a lot of soldiers' life. If the USA throw soldiers into battlefields, a lot of soldiers would die and commit war crimes. Drones prevent those things. We cannot criticize drones simply."
NBE01842,"I was surprised for me to read this report. Many people are dead when A attacks. And the civilian is also dead. The side which surely is attacked is safe. However, the side attacked is dangerous. A will surely be used more. The civilian must be made not to be attacked."
NBE02537,"USA has played a important role in the international power relationship. The overwhelming military power has allowed US to do that, and yet that overwhelming monopoly of military power has caused controversy in all times. Drones may be discussed as a issue now, but as time goes by the argument will vanish and fade away."
NBE01647,"I was very surprised to read this article, also I was sad. I do not think USA should use drone strikes any more. Many innocent people have died because of the bomb. I strongly believe that we cannot end war by using such dangerous weapons."
NBE01526,I was surprised at this news. This problem is not simple and there is no best answer for everyone. I think it's the most important to guarantee the civilian's lives. I also think that why a side that drop bombs on a country that is another side does not talk a matter out with another side before dropping bombs. It's so far to come the peaceful world.
NBE01425,"I think escalated the use of drone strikes is not acceptable. I have a reason for this. The reasons is that using drones don't make the users of them feel guilty, because the users don't have to go to the killing fields by themselves. Because of the reason, I'm against the use of drones."
NBE01376,"I agree to the contents of the first paragraph. It may be necessary by any chance. However, the authorities must not injure an innocent citizen and will lose trust if they do such a thing. They will regret that they judge decision to make harm on people. I can not understand the reason why they want to use drone strikes for by all means. And, I think the people objecting to the dangerous policy of the authorities should insist more."
NBE02439,"America says drones are used to counter terrorism, but I think there is a paradox. Drone strikes made so many casualties in the world. Innocent civilians having been killed generates grudge and hate against America. This cause to grow up expected terrorists. You should think about what you deal with. Though drone have no life, there are many lives and human's emotion in the attacked area. I disagree the drone which makes negative feelings in peoples mind and new terrorists."
NBE01553,"I do not think that the arguments about drones will vanish and fade away. The reason is that I think that in the future, the number of drones will be increased and almost all the wars will be occurred by using drones because of the development of the science. I think that drones make war easy thing and bring less guilty feeling to the operators. Therefore, many more drones in the future must emphasize these negative points more than now."
NBE02194,"Now, Drones is used some countries. A few days ago, China's army said if the Self- Defense Forces shoots down the drones of China, China will attack Japan. Drones has no people and don't catch by radar, so they can invade other country easily. I think Drone strikes should be limited, because they sometimes be causes of war. Terrorism should be prevented by other ways."
NBE02277,"I agree his opinion. The contents of Three Laws of Robotics is so important. A robot is made by humans. So, robot should be benefit to humans. Why people made UAVs? UAVs are weapons to kill people. It's contradiction. Humans make a robot to kill humans."
NBE02616,"I insist that the use of drones should be ended right now. This is mainly because it makes soldiers be lack of senses of killing people and guilty, and thereby increases the number of civilian casualties. Actually, the Gulf War, being also called Nintendo War after using missiles and drones, had more civilian casualties than usual wars. The same can be said of Iraq War. Soldiers only use monitors to decide where to launch missiles and drones, and after that, only press a button to exterminate the place. It kills many people regardless of his or her sex and age. This indiscriminate killing should be strongly punished. To prevent the miserable killings, UN should constitute the international laws which bans the use of drones and punish soldiers who kills many civilians."
NBE01576,"This news surprised me, because the US, which has the biggest influence on the General Assembly in the UN, was accused of its military action. The US has attacked many countries to counter terrorism and to protect people from a tyrant, as if it was the world police. However, even if its purpose is to make peace, relying on weapons cannot be a solution. Moreover, thousands of civilians have been killed in drone strikes. This will create new hatred between people or nations so that conflicts will never end. The UN General Assembly should stop relying on the US army and should take an alternative way to counter terrorism."
NBE02247,I think that Drone strikes is that it is not really good. An uninhabited airplane will be able to kill people. War may become game feeling. And a civilian's victims will further increase in number. This is not allowed even if it is the United Nations. I want to Drone strikes were disappeared all over the world.
NBE01321,"Drone strikes is really make this world peace? It if fact that sometimes force is needed, but now we don't want all world to war. Specifically, when America did strike syria, they were accused and their people felt sad of own country's action. I think America should not repeat same fail."
NBE01687,"I do not agree with your opinion. Whatever reasons USA has, the way that uses weapons should not be justified."
NBE02375,"Drones is easy to kill people, so I think using drones is very dangerous, too. But a courier service by drones is started in Australia, it is a useful use to reduce costs by using drones. So I guess it can't hurt to think another method of using."
NBE02698,"Whether or not Drone strikes violate international law , it should not be justified because it can kill a lot of people. Excessive military technology may cause new collision and war and so on , I think."
NBE02082,"Always I think ""what is the justice?"" when I read the news like this article. Often the US hero movie write ""hero's enemy is full evil"" but it is impossible. Everybody who is doing war, believe ""I am the justice!"" so I think this issue is difficult."
NBE02022,I knew Drone by this article. I think USA should stop using Drone. Because it bombs by only sensing a block of body temperature. So Drone kills many innocent people meaninglessly. And USA government conceals its information. I wish that Japan doesn't become as USA by adopting secret law.
NBE01404,"The Pakistan ministry of foreign affairs has records of as many as 330 drone strikes in the country's north-western tribal areas since 2004, Up to 2, 200 people have been killed of whom at least 400 were civilians. And in Yemen, as many as 58 civilians are thought to have been killed in attacks by UAVs. This information was shocked to me. Why are innocent of civilians killed? Drone strikes are really dangerous. That is true, but it is difficult to extinguish them completely."
NBE01463,"I agree with your opinion. It is difficult that human judge the weapon like drone strikes is bad or not. However, we should prevent from using dangerous weapon. I don't agree with the use of drone strikes."
NBE02667,"I'm sure technologies have been improved very much these days, but a drone, remotely piloted aircraft is still too early to actually use. Of course, if we can succeed in making perfectly safe airplanes controlled by machine, that's better. However in fact it is endangering many civilians' life now. Under this situation, to continue using drones is too risky for America's dignity. Although some might say America no longer has its dignity, I think America still takes big leadership in the world. I want American government to bravely stop using drones at once."
NBE02621,"I disagree with your opinion. No matter what efforts we made, the war would never disappear. This is evident from the history. Unless we threw away the concepts of state and race, we would fight each other. Therefore, using drones should be banned because it makes more civilian casualties."
NBE02801,"I was very surprised at the truth that such many civilian casualties hurt by drone strikes there were. Because we live in a peaceful and quiet country, Japan, we tend to be ignorant about terrible matters in the world. In order to realize world peace, we must concern about incidents all over the world as widely as possible."
NBE02804,I sympathized your opinion about the gap of guilty feeling between killing by a missile and that by a knife. Attacks from the sky reminds me of a game.
NBE02322,"It is natural that the drone strikes violate international law, I suppose. It's like the atomic bombs that were dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and , to put it in an extreme way, the simultaneous terrorism that attacked America in 2001. Citizens of countries attacked by drone strikes didn't know when it would be dropped. It is very shameful that the country that suffered the sorrows of indiscriminate killing became an indiscriminate killer."
NBE01947,"I agree with you. Of course, I hope humans stop to war and stop to make arms. However I think that a weapon will not disappear. The people will say, ""it is for peace""."
NBE02344,I'm interested in this news. This is because I don't think drone strikes make world's peace. Also I fear about it will violent international law. Also the users of drones may not feel the sense of killing people. It is really dangerous for human moral. so that I want US government will stop to use drones.
NBE02417,"Is it good for people to use drone strikes? I think this is a really difficult question and I don't think there is a right answer for that. I always feel really complicated when I hear a news or a paradoxical problem related to US military. Drone strikes can kill the people who is innocent, so I think it is not good for them to use drone strikes. I know it will be hard but I want American government to stop using it once."
NBE01511,"I always feel fearful when I read the article of foreign country. I never see the word ""kill"" or ""die"". I don't understand about a foreign situation, but I want foreign country be peace like Japan."
NBE01512,"White do you think more important, our freedom or security? I think security is more important. The law will save our security. So I agree with it."
NBE02158,"I agree with your opinion. US is the one of the most powerful nation, so US ought to consider world peace. However, these weapons may go out of control. They are dangerous weapons for us."
NBE02004,I agree with your opinion. We should oversee their way to use it
NBE01890,"I think it is very difficult problem and much to be discussed. For sure, USA may violate the international law, but also there're no other means to defeat the terrorism."
NBE01875,I was very surprised to read this article because I did not know UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles). It is too cruel because civilians never defend from such attacks. I also think Obama doing a good work but I wonder why a United Nations cannot move more. A United Nations should also take against the terrorism.
NBE02255,I think so. I want to keep peace without new weapons. I don't agree with Obama's policy.
NBE02106,"Yeah I agree with you. This kind of problem is not simply about justice or people's right or something like that. It is true that those weapons are cruel, cowardice, savage. It really sucks. But the fact that the US are the leader to fight terrorism and the US uses those weapons to counter terrorism are unshakeable. To change this situation other countries should gain power in the counter-terrorism field and try to regulate or supervise the abuse of those weapons by the US."
NBE01876,"I agree with you. We have to find better way to solve this problem. This problem is very difficult, but we should not compromise to die many people. We have to think more and more."
NBE01971,"I think so, too. The man cannot help feeling the direct attack is heavy and the indirect attack is light. Because the man cannot feel indirect event as heavy accident. So we should more think about this indirect war."
NBE02425,I also think it is a difficult problem to solve and I don't think there is an answer. We need to try to find better answer.
NBE01434,"I agree with your opinion because I believe there must be a way to settle this problem without fighting. I don't want anyone to be killed or injured because of drone attacks. Because of these reasons, I'm against the use of drones."
NBE01628,I agree with you. It is difficult to make one answer. We should think more deeply about this problem.
NBE01411,"I agree with you. This problem is very difficult. I wish to be found the point of compromise between ""military"" and ""civilian safety""."
NBE02781,I agree with your opinion. I think that we should have consciousness of murder not to be cruel murderer.
NBE01487,"I disagree with you. Of course there are no war, drone aren't used. But in actually, the war never ending and drone was needed. So the most argent task is eliminate sad civilians killed by drone. America should stop the using of drone immediately."
NBE01517,I also think it is difficult problem to be discussed. But I want foreign country to move peace.
NBE01801,"I agree with your opinion . It is true that drone is useful. However people can kill human easily. so, I think we should deracinate drone as soon as quickly."
NBE02465,"US should terminate thing like this. they always stimulate other countries and lead to war. If this occurred, the world would be more peaceful."
NBE02171,I was shocked by reading the following passage. The strike causes damage to citizen and it isn't effective in protecting them.
NBE02468,I totally agree with you. I think it must be prohibited to use drones.
NBE01923,"I don't think so. I think that it cannot help the USA using drone strikes. It is true that drones kill a lot of people. However, they don't commit war crimes. If the USA throw many soldiers into battlefields, a lot of soldiers would die and commit war crimes. Drones prevent those things. We cannot criticize drones simply."
NBE02303,I was very surprised to read it. And I think it is too difficult to decide the justice about them. Because we do not know what we should consider as important.
NBE02027,"I think so. America want to be a ""hero"". But I think America should consider not only American life but also other countries' people's life!"
NBE01250,I disagree with you. I think drone strikes are necessary for us. Because drone strikes will defense our country. But we don't use it to attack country. Drone strikes are necessary for us!!!!!
NBE02520,I agree with you. It is difficult to answer. Maybe no one can judge which is right. We should think more deeply about this problem and manage to solve problem.
NBE02199,"I think so. Japanese media should report more information about world like this, but it's also important that we get news by ourselves from foreign media."
NBE02649,"I agree with you. This problem is so complicated. US have to use drone to save the lives of their people. It is not easy for US to dispose the weapons. To dispose it, they have to end the war."
NBE01532,I think so too. I want to keep peace. Any counties should get rid of weapons. (I couldn't log in my account. )
NBE01711,"I agree with you. We play many TV games on war, but it's real to happen in the world in this moment. It's really horrible and we have to stop it."
NBE02329,I completely agree with you. SIt is impossible to make America stop using drone. It's sad but true. So America should decrease the use of it gradually.
NBE02442,"[shiwori's comment]Americans love to be a ""hero"" but they need to think about what ""justice"" they are fighting for. reply [my thought It's too philosophical to discuss calmly the issue of drone. Although Justice is interesting and academic issue , I think we shouldn't discuss justice in this article. I disagree the drone , of course all of the competition by military power. It can be said an ideal , but I don't want to throw away the ideal and want to be an adult who can think logically and practicably about war."
NBE02400,"I disagree with you on the positive point of using drone that you think. I expect that some or many people may be killed when drone brakes. Because drone goes everywhere without a pilot, it could destroy buildings or strikes people unintentionally. They could bring great suffering of innocent people, so I think every drone should disappear."
NBE01352,"Look back history of war, the new technology or weapon is certainly abused for the war potential. It is true that UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) is very useful if each country makes use of it properly. I'm worried each country abuse it for the war and the situation gets worse."
NBE01353,I agree with you. It may be wrong the solution of stopping the war is military power. It is difficult to solve such a problem.
NBE01755,"Drone strikes may decrease the risks of its soldiers, but the problem is at the same time they make it easier to attack other countries, cities, and people. Because of drones, I think, the structure of human fight is changing. People have had guns and they attack people to protect their lives and families and countries. But drone strikes are committed by few, powerful people. Force of national army is getting absolute power, and I think the way we live and fight will be strongly influenced by it."
NBE01292,"Drone strike is effective way strategically, and it can also reduce the number of soldiers who are killed in action. Therefore, citizens support the way better than previous way. Of course, we shouldn't break out any war, but it is extremely hard to achieve. So I think making the rule about drone strikes is needed and it will be made soon."
NBE01268,"I think We should not use unmanned aerial vehicles. If pilot controls plane, it don't attack civilian by mistake. But drone may attack civilian by mistake. It is very dangerous. So I think we should not use drone to keep civilian's safe."
NBE02546,"I agree with you. It is difficult to solve. Through a debating, We have to find better way to solve this problem."
NBE01443,"I'm against with your opinion that drone strikes are necessary for us. I believe we can defense country without using drones , and we should find better way to prevent country from arracks without using drones."
NBE02051,"I agree with you. I also think this incident is so frightening. For the future, we should talk and improve how to use drone!"
NBE01303,"I don't think so, the US have not shown the power by the military technology. Recently, the US have not won any war completely. Iraq, Afghanistan. More worse, the US couldn't use the military power to Syria. Actually the US has the strong power, but doesn't use the power effectively."
NBE01599,"I think this is very controversial problem. At a glance, unmanned aerial vehicles are so innovative. This machine has chance to lead to technical progress. But it is bad to use this new technology for the way goes against justice. We must deal with technology carefully."
NBE01609,They lost sight of justice. Such childish heroism is no use.
NBE02054,"When I read this article , I thought that Drone strikes and lacking of transparency are not really good. but, this is too difficult to decide the justice. . ."
NBE05765,"I felt resentful when I know the news. Indeed, they have duty to save the world peace because they are the most powerful developed country, but they should protect the law at the same time. UAV is good for achieving the mission. However, while it kill the civilian who don't do something bad. The US should esteem an individual."
NBE02123,"The US is often said to be 'the world's policeman, ' but by wiretapping, the US lost the trust by Merkel and other people. What is the real reason to wiretap? Is that really needed? Two years ago, the US demanded Japan to help wiretap. However, Japan didn't accept the request. I think a lot of people somehow had known the wiretapping by the US. The truth the US was wiretapping was just happened to be revealed."
NBE02773,"I think that spying is unpleasant action. Nobody want to be bugged private talking by another person so spying violate privacy. Even if the US protect own country against terrorism, spying is not best way. It is because spying might involve unrelated person."
NBE01996,"I was surprised to hear that. The U. S use spying to counter terrorism. However, this violates human rights. Although The U. S protect own nation, there is other way except for spying. The U. S should change the way to other way."
NBE02403,"I think the US should operate other ways to counter terrorism without spying because it will destroy relationships with other countries. As Angela Merkel says, it is not fair that the US only spy other countries, when others not. In the world today, the US is the most powerful and influential country in economically and politically, it should not be right that the US are lost faith in it by them. In the passage, it is also written that spying is needed for commercial and business reasons, but I doubt that they are the right reasons for it. One way to avoid spying that I can think of is that the US has a stronger bond with other countries in militarily and commercially. It is of course difficult, but that could be the best way."
NBE02392,"I agree with ID13031. I think the US should operate other ways to counter terrorism without spying because it will destroy relationships with other countries. As Angela Merkel says, it is not fair that the US only spy other countries, when others not. In the world today, the US is the most powerful and influential country in economically and politically, it should not be right that the US are lost faith in it by them. In the passage, it is also written that spying is needed for commercial and business reasons, but I doubt that they are the right reasons for it. One way to avoid spying that I can think of is that the US has a stronger bond with other countries in militarily and commercially. It is of course difficult, but that could be the best way"
NBE01554,"After I read this article, I thought that Japan is in crisis more than German. Because Japan has no law which punish spying. To defeat this situation, present Prime Minister Sinzo Abe suggests that Japan make NSC, an institution which protect secret information. However, I think that this institution may lead to violation of constitution. A right to know may not be assured. Therefore, I think Mr. Abe must consider carefully about how to use it when he make such system."
NBE01917,"It puzzles me that the US did such a foolish activity. It leads to the US's loss of trust with a lot of countries. It never gives any profit to the US. To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if the US spied on China or Russia. It is because they are imaginary enemies for the United States. However, it spied on Germany. Germany is a alliance to the US. Its spying activity is very disrespect."
NBE02098,"I do agree that the US needs to lead the world to fight terrorism. In order to realize it, research or investigation in other country is necessary. The problem is that The US done that without other county's permission, in other word, ""spy"". This action of the US may lead the world to chaos and prevent the world from cooperating against terrorism. I always doubt the way the US fight terrorism. They always harm themselves by themselves."
NBE01706,"I think it's silly of America to having done like that because it's very risky and it would be very serious if it is discovered. We have to cooperate with other countries to maximize human potential now, but America's action this time brought distrust in the world. Of course, to build counter-terrorism strategy is necessary for people on the earth, but I believe that there is otherwise, and America should take a different direction for it by taking advantage of this matter."
NBE02512,"I don't agree with the US. The US do the spying in order to counter the terrorism. Spying is one of the most important thing to counter terrorism. However, the terrorism is not exactly defined in the world, and so different countries have different concepts of terrorism. Even if the US do the spying such as NSA's tapping the Merkel's phone in order to do that, the other countries could not consider it countering terrorism. If the US's action is permitted, the US can do anything on the plea of countering terrorism and any countries cannot stop the US. Through this accident, the US may take more independent action, in my opinion. Therefore I feel dangerous and I agree with European countries reaction."
NBE02488,"To recover the broken trust between individuals is very difficult. Let alone to recover the broken trust between countries is more difficult. I don't know why America wiretapping, Germany ought to feel bad. America must make a sincere response to Germany."
NBE02489,"I agree with your opinion. The US should change the way to other way. If America wants to true peace, America should make true relationship. It is not like wiretapping."
NBE02278,"I was not surprised at this news. In my image, the spy is natural in USA. In the America, Hollywood stars have not privacy because of paparazzi. So, American people seem to be able to get other's private information easily."
NBE02748,"Reading this article, I had gooseflesh because of terror. Such situation may cause loss of mutual trust and conflict between countries. If the problem gets worse, it may also have a risk to touch off war. In my opinion, even though he had assured Merkel that the United States ""is not monitoring and will not monitor"" her communications, Obama should have taken more care about the information management because another news items reported that Obama said he hadn't know about the such NSA's action like a spy. I hope there will be no more such conflict."
NBE01778,"I understand the US claim that NSA's spying is a necessary part of their counter-terorrism strategy around world. But I think this way produce a vicious cycle and distrust between US and other country. If the US has a sense of responsibility for world peace, they should take steps that don't lose the credit."
NBE01777,"I understand the US claim that NSA's spying is a necessary part of their counter-terorrism strategy around world. But I think this way produce a vicious cycle and distrust between US and other country. If the US has a sense of responsibility for world peace, they should take steps that don't lose the credit."
NBE02150,"The counter-terorrism is very important problem for US. However, this way makes bad feeling all over the world. From now on, international relations become more important for counter-terrorism strategy. The enemies are the terrorists but not the other countries."
NBE01378,"I was surprised to read this article not only because details but also America's attitude. I felt German's claim was reasonable and America's deed was unreliable. Why is USA without showing embarrassment? If America is done same thing they did, they are surely be angry, I think. I guess that they think that acknowledge own fault is risky. But I think if they hope for safety and peace world and smooth diplomacy, they should feel shame at own behaves and apologize to German. And I think if USA doesn't apologize, another country can do same thing, so, now, I desire America acknowledge it's misdeed."
NBE02226,"This is like the world in George Orwell's novel, ""1984"". What NSA has done is certainly unacceptable. Actually, the US's spying scares me more than fear of terrorism dose."
NBE01507,"I think bugging is bad think. But it can be justified by the circumstances. In this case, the purpose to bug is for protecting own country against terrorism. Of course, the basic human rights should be respected. But common welfare has a priority to the basic human rights."
NBE01682,"I feel bad to read this news. I think that the United States of America wants to be stand at advantage over all over the world. So, I think that this action is not good."
NBE01736,"I liked your opinion because it was unique. Of course spying is unpleasant because it infringes the country's right. But the best is should be the situation any country have no secrets, same as human. However, once each countries had their weapons, making the ideal situation must be impossible. So it may be true that spying is natural, and each countries must keep their secrets not to be revealed."
NBE02155,"I agree with your opinion. US is the one of the most powerful nation, so US ought to consider world peace. However, the world peace is made up of the good relations between countries. If US consider teh counter-terorrism strategy, they must not use the way like this case."
NBE02373,"Merkel, is referred to as the ""Iron Lady"" in the same way as Thatcher former Prime Minister, has been selected repeatedly in the US business magazine ""Forbes"" as a woman with the power in the world. I think she is an influential people like this, so this incident Merkel's cell phone had been eavesdropping is an serious issue that shakes not only Germany, but the world. Also for the future, the relationship between Germany and the United States is not deteriorated, the United States will have to accept this incident with sincerity. Also, I think Japan must also be measures with a sense of crisis."
NBE02130,"I agree with you. And I think the longer the wiretapping had been done, the more difficult it is to broken recover trust. Mr. Obama looks gentleman. I want him to behavior as gentleman to Ms. Merkel and other presidents."
NBE02131,"I like your opinion, too. When I read your comment, I noticed that I had the image ""The spy is natural in USA. "" It's interesting, and I thought people's opinion can easily affected by some news or other people's opinion."
NBE02374,I was thinking the same thing as what you think. This incident looks like controlled society that is drawn by George Orwell. So what NSA has done is supposedly impermissible thing. We must stop the runaway of the organization and nation.
NBE01824,"I think the information has a influence and worth in modern society. Now, we can manage information easily through the communication tools such as cell phone and computer. In the other hand, information could be leaked easily too, even if we use them carefully. For countries, the information are more important and has many risks. Once this kind of accident happened, it is difficult to make up the lack of transparency."
NBE01579,"It was not surprising to me that the US spied among its allies, because the country doesn't even hesitate to monitor its own people's telecommunication and logs on the Internet. I understand Merkel's anger. Nevertheless, I suspect that leaders of EU member countries could have known the fact, or that they did the same or similar allegations as the US did. In a case of a personal matter, spying your friends is never acceptable. However, regarding diplomacy, many countries have spied each other. In our time, information technology has been developing rapidly. Every country needs to reconsider its data agreements based on trust with its allies."
NBE02598,"I agree with you. The threat of the terrorism is growing today and actually it is needed to get more information as possible, but governments mustn't get information of privacy. This is human rights, that should be protected first of all."
NBE02081,"I think so. I don't want to be spied from everybody. But I can't blame them. Because to fight with terrorism is very difficult, and we don't have the way to counterterrorism. If terrorism decrease by spying, I agree with the US."
NBE02668,"These reactions to the spying are just a simpler and more understandable way to justify a global shift out from under the control of the US. The near collapse of the global economy has created a concerted movement to almost ignore what is now widely seen as a corrupt and dysfunctional plutocracy. China's official position for the downturn is on record as the ""Triffin Dilemma"", and that assessment is correct. It means that the US is systematically parasitic and detrimental to global development via abuse of the reserve currency status and via the IMF, WTO, and the World Bank. This allegation too is so clearly and mathematically sound that there is no defense or excuse that might repair relations. The US simply tried to manipulate the global economy unfairly in every possible way and the ROW is now responding with a united front."
NBE01626,"I agree with this opinion. It is true that we should get more information to confront terrorism , but the way should not violate the human rights . The US should take other way."
NBE01330,"I was surprised to hear that. Although I understand the US claim that NSA's spying is a necessary part of their counter-terorrism strategy around world, they should know the border between good and not good ethically. Even if that act help government in some part, other problem will occur in other part as now. The goal we should head for is more basic part."
NBE02806,"I think we cannot say unconditionally that spying is a bad action. Spying is sometimes necessary for nations' security in the international society. It is true that spying might involve unrelated person, but I think spys of nations would not leak the information they get unreasonably."
NBE01949,"I agree with you. America's action this time brought distrust in the world. It is easy to lose the trust, but it is not easily restored. The United States must make much efforts from now on."
NBE02345,"I was really surprised to hear this news. This is because US used the way of spying. I know counter terrorism is a very serious problem for US, but use the way of spy is not good way and it's dishonest. I can understand US's think but, they need to think other way to counter terrorism"
NBE02625,"This discovery of US's bugging lessens Europe's trusts in US. It is said that the Germany are sensitive to wiretapping and bugging because they were bugged and suppressed in ideology and speech by the East Germany government. Although spying is common in developed countries, infringing individual rights is unacceptable. Therefore, developed countries have to set a high value on the balance between privacy prevention and spying."
NBE02003,"I do not agree with your opinion. You say ""Hollywood stars have not privacy because of paparazzi. "" This is true of big stars. However, we are normal people, not big stars. You have to think about this problem from the point of our view. There are not only stars in US"
NBE01660,"I agree with you. Counter-terrorism is important for the US indeed. However, wire tapping is against morals. This tapping may make the relation between the U. S. and Germany worse. However, in order to present terrorism, the U. S. and Germany should corporate."
NBE01433,I agree with your opinion that the US should know better than to do such spying action. The reason why I feel so is that it is not good for the US to lose trust from the foreign country by spying other countries' leaders. So I think the US should stop their spying .
NBE02397,"I think it is important for America to apologize to Germany too. If you want to be put others's trust in you, apology could be the best way. America cannot be a influential countries in the world without the good relationship with developed countries especially European countries, so apology is needed to make things better."
NBE02701,"This behave seems to be misled by other countries. Recently , this kind of matter sometimes happens. In the future , technology can cause conflict and war and so on , I think."
NBE02424,I was really surprised by this news. The US used the spying to counter terrorism. But I don't think this is a good way to do that and I think they should find another way.
NBE01334,I disagree with you. Because I think it is difficult to decide which is wrong. The important thing is not deciding wrong but searching best solution.
NBE02704,"I agree with you because spying is unethical behave. To protect terrorism , US should more pay attention to behavior not doing this kind oh thing."
NBE02726,"I agree with your opinion. And I also think that US should change their way for terrorism. If the way is not the way it doesn't hurt other people, it is impossible to eliminate the danger or the battle in the world."
NBE02645,"The news of America's spy include this article made me scared. NSA spy to all of the world. By spying, they get plenty of information. Japan is included of their target. It means they may listen to our phone conversation or read e-mail. If so, I feel so bad."
NBE01389,"I agree with your opinion that spying is unpleasant action. I think the US should have protected own, with another way. I think that the state do such a thing may drive negatively to the public. This action will make the world to worse because country may have doubt to other countries."
NBE02570,"This news gave us big shock. I think that the diplomacy is made by the trust between countries. So this matter undermined the confidence for America around the world, especially Germany. I want U. S to reflect on his actions. And never do such as thing."
NBE02470,I agree with you. But the technology has become already the cause of conflict or war. So we should pay more attention to this kind of news. This matters to Japan as well.
NBE02306,"I think our privacy should keep, also the chancellor. Surely, the information about other countries. But A country does not have the right which invade individual privacy, I think."
NBE01354,"I agree with you. The action just violates human rights, so American government should apologize about it. It is surely to oppose terrorism, the information is essential. However, it does mot admit ignoring human rights."
NBE01412,It was dangerous. I worried about US and Germany start to not like each other more. I think the U. S can protect own nation except for spying.
NBE01759,"I have been afraid of these problems since I heard of the news which told about the leak of NSA. Of course international laws have to be obeyed, but you can never stop leaking information or violating the laws perfectly. To keep the world order you have not to point all the violation out."
NBE02209,"I have a image of freedom about the US , but there're a lot of problem like this. Nowadays I look the US on something suspiciously. The US is a big country, so it has a big power. The world should look the action of The U. S. carefully."
NBE01439,I think US should know better than to do such spying action. The reason why I feel so is that it is not good for the US to lose trust from the foreign country by spying other countries' leaders. So I think the US should stop their spying .
NBE02548,I agree with your opinion. Counter-terrorism is important for the US indeed. But I also think it is not the best way to spy. So they have to search better way.
NBE01897,"US is fighting against terrorism. It is reliable. But, to violate the international law and to claim that spies are justified are far from justice. US must claim the necessity of the spy and enjoy the approval from other nations."
NBE01297,"No matter how hard the US struggle to fight against terrorists, it cannot be the reason invading other country's ""privacy"", in short, getting confidential information. On the different point of view, after all, bugging one's telephone must not be revealed. This accident is all blame to the US government."
NBE01900,"I agree with you. Even though for beating terrorism it is necessary to use the spy, the spy violate those who lives common life. It is serious problem."
NBE01492,"I can understand America is doing all the means for the fight against terrorism. However, I think that the spying is counterproductive. This is because spying of other countries, the country is no longer trust the United States. And these antipathy also inhibit international cooperation."
NBE02052,"I was thinking same thing. Nowadays, our enemy is not country, but terrorists. . . . When I heard this news, , I thought about privacy policy."
NBE01993,I was surprised to hear the news. The brain uses sleep to wash up the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking. This is very important findings. I think please continue to research the brain and sleep.
NBE01426,"After reading this article, I realized that sleep plays an important role for us to live. I didn't know that Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease is related to sleep, so I was surprised to know this fact. It means that if we don't get enough sleep, it will increase the risk of diseases. So I think I need to change my sleeping pattern because I don't sleep well these days."
NBE01994,I agree with newcatnewcat's opinion. Sleeping pattern is related to diseases. This surprised me. I have to change it.
NBE01552,"Although I knew a little that sleep is necessary for the brain to arrange information people have, I was surprised to know that sleep washs away the waste toxins in the brain. If this cleaning mechanism of brain is studied more and something would be discovered, diseases such as Alzheimer or Parkinson may be cured. It is true that the brain controls almost all the human, so studying of brain should be encouraged more. However, science and technology must not be abused. To achieve this, education in science and ethics should be emphasized. I hope that technological development contribute to the happiness of people."
NBE02276,"I learned that the sleeping is so important through this article. In fact, I don't have enough time of sleep. Yesterday, I couldn't sleep because of meeting. The day before yesterday, I went to bed at 3 o'clock and wake up 6 o'clock. I have a sense of crisis to not only skin but also brain."
NBE02722,"Reading this article, I was not very surprised and was relieved because I already have had my pattern of sleep. Basically I sleep at 12 and get up at 6. However I was very surprised at some part of the story. The vital function does not appear while the mind is awake. By the lack of sleep, the toxin proteins may accumulate in our brain. The build up will lead us to many conditions which lead to the loss of brain cells such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease. Because these risk are lurking, I hope that the study will be more advanced. At the same time, I thought I should be careful not to break my sleep pattern."
NBE02223,I'm happy to read this news as this article justifies my idle slumber.
NBE02124,"I usually sleep for 7 hours and I often said it is enough, but for me, it's not enough. It is often said that sleeping is good for our health and I think so, too. However, I didn't know that sleep cleans the brain. At first, I didn't have the idea that there are damaged proteins in the brain. Maybe I have less damaged proteins than other people. I read this news and I thought I should sleep for 7 hours."
NBE02771,"This article is so useful for me. I have not known about function of the brain until now, but I have believed sleep is very important action for us and taken a sleep enough time. Therefore, I could reconfirm importance of sleep. I would like to cherish sleep."
NBE02747,"I have never heard the brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins. Now, I understand why I have a poor memory. My brain cannot wash the brain enough because of my short sleep, and there might be a lot of toxins. Anyway, this is just a joke. I know it is the only excuse for me because I am supposed to take enough sleeping hours. So, I have poor memory by nature. However, if it work effectively, I will use sleeping time more importantly."
NBE01648,"I realize the importance of sleep. Of course, I have heard that sleep is important for our health. However, I haven't heard that brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins. I did not know Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease are related to brain cells, either. I would like to take enough sleep in order to my health."
NBE02369,"Although I knew that sleep is good for we are in good health, I was surprised that there is a role to get rid of harmful toxins that sleep produces in the brain. I also thought and It looks there are many that the functions and mechanisms of the brain has not been elucidated yet. That's why I think the brain is a place that is hidden a lot of potential. And taking a good quality sleep for the brain is essential. I cannot help but make light of taking sleep, but I thought I should make much of taking sleep all the same."
NBE02391,"I think it is amazing that scientists have found that the brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking. As they suggest that problems with the brain's cleaning mechanism may contribute to Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, it means that they would be cured if science in technology advances more, like ID13013 says. In addition to that, I am expecting scientists to find the way to cure insomnia, because it is also well-known that a kind of sleeping disorder causes insomnia. When it comes to myself, I usually fall asleep within 5 minutes after going to bed, and it is the best time in a day that I truly feel comfortable. For purpose of this, I do not understand why some people have trouble sleeping, and I feel sorry for them as they cannot know the happiness of sleeping. To solve this problem, I would like scientists to study the mechanism of sleeping more."
NBE01680,I was surprised at the news because I did not know that the brain worked so hard during I was sleeping. I wonder when the brain takes a rest if it works all the time. I think it may possibly work all the time. I understand a brain plays an important role as far as we live.
NBE01820,"I think sleep is necessary for human to live healthfully. I knew that sleep is important, but I often stayed up late when I wanted to watch TV, play games and do my homework. Actually, I usually regret that I didn't sleep enough because the next day, I can't wake up early and I am sleepy all day. So I decided to sleep as long as possible especially when I have exams. I should study beforehand otherwise I can't clean toxins and memorize something new. I keep this article in mind to use my brain in a best condition in the exams."
NBE02193,"I could know by this news that Sleep is necessary for our lives. However, I sometimes stay up late or sleep for short time. According to this news, my body may have a lot of toxins. Besides, short sleeping leads to illness such as Alzheimer and Parkinson. I afraid of it. So, I want to have enough sleep from now on."
NBE01506,"I have thought that the brain don't sleep any time. So, I was surprised when I read this article and I knew the system of the brain. And I was happy to know it. I want to know about the brain more."
NBE01918,"This news made me very happy. It is because the news justified my sleep. I want to sleep more! From now on, if I late for class, I will excuse myself for coming late ""It was because my brain washed away the waste toxins!"" It would make teachers angry, however."
NBE02069,"Whenever the test term, I try to sleep at least 3 hours, because I believe sleep organize memory in the brain and I can't get a good score without sleep. In this news, if we can't get a sleep, our brain ware damaged by toxin. So we have to sleep not only to organize memory but also to protect our brain from poison. This is good reason to explain to my parents ""why I'm always sleeping until noon at holiday. "" Anyhow I have learned sleep is important! But I have a night shift today!! haha! I want to sleep. . . umm. ."
NBE02099,"Well, I didn't know that! I did recognize the importance of sleep but I didn't know the flood wash up my brain during sleep to wash away poisons(however it is uncertain how much this new discovery is reliable). This means if you keep awake for a long time and never sleep. your brain will go bad , or maybe get rotten by the poison! That's awful. I'd better sleep more, maybe during class. HAHA just kidding -"
NBE02149,"I felt the importance of sleeping. I knew that it is useful to fix the memory. However, I don't know this effect of sleeping. Then, I make up my mind to sleep longer for my health. Of course, it is important to stay up in class, too."
NBE01704,"The more studying come out, the more importance of sleep we get to know, I felt this when I read this article. And, it's possible that much knowledge on sleep hasn't found yet, so I'm thinking to take my sleep more seriously, because the students at universities tend to like not to sleep and play at bar, karaoke room or something like that. I heard that it's difficult for sophomore to attend even second period lesson. It must be very easy and usual when they are high school students and before then. We are already next to workers, so should have awareness as an adult and take care of ourselves with knowledge and some device."
NBE02511,"I was so surprised to hear the news and this news makes me sad if this news is true. Of course, I knew the sleeping have a big role in fixing memories, however I don't know it may have another important role in brain such as removal system. The removal system should be needed for human health in my opinion, and so I have to make up my mind to keep more sleeping time because I don't have enough time to sleep every day. I hope this study will contribute to the diseases which have not been solved."
NBE01794,"When I read this article, I was very interested because I take a lot of sleep every day but I didn't know the reason why people always become sleepy, so I have wanted to know a system of sleep until now. To know about this research in the article made my happy, because I take a lot of a sleep. So my brain may be very clean."
NBE02641,"After I read this news, I found sleeping is very important for my body. Sleeping can wash away the waste toxins built up during my hard day's thinking. . . In these days, I often go to bed at 2am and wake up at 7am. It's not enough sleep for me, so I have to try to go to bed earlier than now!"
NBE02564,"When I read this, I understood this view and thought, too. Of course, everyone knows sleep is important. But we understood it vaguely. In my opinion, many students in Japan tend to stay up late and always feel sleepy. So there are a lot of short sleeper! For example, I took little sleep, about 3 hours, recently. Probably with this effect, I feel very bad and keep having headache. Short sleep makes my health bad surely. I realized again good sleep make good health."
NBE01732,"I felt that too! If the sleeping is the correct thing for our health, why it must be banned to sleep at any time! Of course it may not be a good thing to sleep when or where we shouldn't sleep, for example in the daytime or during the class. But if it is our body's reaction to keep us healthy, I think it may not be great to be scolded in such situation. Even if it is idle, it may be nice if we take care of our health."
NBE01733,"After I read about the news, I felt the importance of sleeping because I had thought the time I sleep is useless and I can use it for better thing if I had a little stronger mind. And I'm trying to begin to take a new habit to get enough sleep. I want to continue the habit not to get diseases in the future."
NBE01483,"Until reading this article, I did not know the meaning of sleep well. I thought it's only putting the memory in order. So I thought that the shorter we sleep, the better our life is. But reading this article and learning about""waste removal system"", I began to think sleep is very important. From now on, I want to get more sleep for health. Although right now is the middle of the night . . . . . ."
NBE01243,"I thought there was the sleep to rest , but it is not true. We use the sleep to wash up the waste toxin, and memorize. When people have a lot of homework, they don't sleep. But it is very bad!! Because they memorize to sleep. We have to sleep to memorize!!"
NBE01843,"I read the report and sympathized. I also think that sleep is important. Unless we go to sleep, energy does not come out of them. And sleep is required in order to wash an unnecessary toxin. To be sure, sleep is required although we cannot do it at all during sleep. I would like to sleep firmly from now on."
NBE01966,I know that a brain needs to sleep to put memorizing order. But facilities of sleep for brain this article said are new to me. My environment of sleep is so bad. I often sleep without noticing it. I sleep not on the bed but on the floor keeping the television turning on and keeping the light switching on. So I think that I don't receive the benefit of sleep very well. I may be Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease in the future. I fell I must improve my sleep habit.
NBE01527,"After I read this news, I found sleeping is very important for my body. Sleep plays a critical role in thinking and learning. Lack of sleep hurts these cognitive processes in many ways. It impairs attention, alertness, concentration, reasoning, and problem solving. This makes it more difficult to learn efficiently. I would like to go to bed airier from today."
NBE01377,"I have known that sleep is essential to live, but I have not known that reason. I read vital function don't appear to be possible while the mind is awake, I am convinced why we need sleep. When I was a high school student, as summer homework, , I looked over materials about sleep and felt sleep is very interesting field. And, sleep is concerned with not only Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, but also lifestyle-related diseases and depression. I want research about sleep advanced."
NBE02487,To sleep cleans the brain of toxins is very interesting. Sleep is still important for human healthy. There is some more secret of the human functions. I think that to solve the human functions as difficult as to solve the universal secret.
NBE02591,It is very surprising to me that sleep actually cleans the brain of toxins with fluid. I think we can someday strengthen our ability of memorizing and realize the health of the brain by sleeping well of course and studying the elements of the fluid and so on.
NBE02302,"When I heard this news, I was very surprised. Because the brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins. I think such problem with the brain's cleaning mechanism may contribute to the diseases."
NBE01458,"I have not known about function of the brain during sleep. I learn function of the brain by reading this news. Sleeping is very important for us. These days, young people cannot sleep enough. I hope that this news is known by many people in the world. Sleeping is good for ourself."
NBE02617,"Until I read this news, I had vague knowledge about sleep. I knew that sleep was important for us and kept our health, but I did not know that sleep washed away the waste toxins in our brains. I cannot imagine that cells in my brain shrink during sleep and fluid flows in the gaps between brain tissue. Recently, lack of sleep among young people in Japan has become a social problem and so they, including me, should notice the function of sleep and sleep enough. Finally, discoveries in science kind of this may improve our lives and lead us to the right way. Although I know but little of science and technology, but I want governments more to support studies of science."
NBE01577,The findings of this research are very interesting. It was amazing that sleep removes the waste toxins from the brain. I had only thought that sleep made the body get relaxed and recover from tiredness. The government and companies should help this research financially so that a lot of new facts about the brain's waste removal system would be found out. I hope that the way to cure Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease will be found in the near future and all the patients in the world will be able to share the benefits.
NBE02246,"This news is very interesting for me. I cannot sleep long time recently because I was being very busy. However, I read this report and noticed the importance of sleep. I was the first to have heard that sleep washes a brain. I want to get more information about toxins. I think that I will sleep the longest possible time from now on."
NBE01323,"I like sleeping. Not, I love sleeping. We usually sleep everyday. Our body need sleep. Especially our brain need sleep to act. This news said that sleep 'cleans' the brain of toxins. When we waked up, we feel clear or not so. In case that we felt clear, our brain was cleaned much. I shall clean my brain by sleeping right now!"
NBE02461,I find sleeping very important for human being after read this article. I usually sleep for 7 hours and I think it's better to keep this. But I heard long sleeping is not good for human body as well. So I want to know about long sleep.
NBE01348,"I know sleeping is so important to maintain our health, but why is it so important? I don't know about it. I often hear that sleeping arranges our memory. So I was surprised sleeping washes away the waste toxins build up a hard day's thinking. Today, sleeping must not be solved perfectly. I wish more research will be conducted about sleeping mechanism."
NBE01940,"I knew that sleep is important for our health before read this news. However, I think many people don't get enough sleep. We will sleep 20 years for 80 years if we sleep for six hours per day. Therefore I want to get the sleep of good quality."
NBE02596,"Since when I read this article, I've tried to sleep as long as possible too because I want to clean my own brain every day. The information of this function encourages us to sleep long and raises the quality of sleep."
NBE01403,"Of course, I know that sleeping is important for our body to keep our health, because my parents always said so when I was kid. But I didn't know why sleeping helps to keep our health. I never know that the brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking. That fact is fantastic!! I really surprised when I read this news. Sleep is good for us, and good for our body."
NBE02697,"Before hearing this news , I tend to sleep longer. Hearing this news , I was relieved because long sleep is not wrong thing."
NBE02080,"Are you ok? I worry about you. And I can't sleep well, because I have many things which have to do. I wanna sleep."
NBE02021,"I have understood sleep is important for health. But I didn't know it related diseases. So I became worried about my sleep style. For example, how many hours do I always sleep in a day, in a week, in a month and how does my sleeping condition ? And I am concerned that new sleep can clean the old toxins not to be cleaned past."
NBE02538,"I was surprised that sleep plays an important role to live. I thought we sleep to rest our bodies and brains, but according to this article, the brain is always working. I learned the importance of sleep, so I think I should take enough sleep."
NBE01465,I agree with your opinion. I think many companies and researchers spend money on research brain to find out the way to cure diseases. I hope the number of patients suffer from Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease decrease.
NBE01245,"I think it is very difficult for brain to sleep because people use brain a lot. I was surprised at the effect of sleep. I didn't know to sleep make their brain clean. I will sleep more, and I want be clever."
NBE02622,"I agree with your opinion. Sleeping is more important than I thought. The same as you, I tend to stay up late so I don't have enough sleep. Therefore, in order to keep our heath and memory, we have to sleep in earlier time than now."
NBE02800,I was very surprised at the truth that brain cells shrink during sleep to open up the gaps between neurons and allow fluid to wash the brain clean. I think the mechanism in our body works really nicely.
NBE01625,I agree with this opinion. I want the researchers to continue research the connection between sleep and brain and utilize the result of the research.
NBE02676,"Improvement of technologies by human being is remarkable. Before I read this article, I was already sure that sleep takes a crucial role to live. Still researchers need to have such a scientific proof to make more progress. So, that research was important. Actually I don't know exactly about brain or cells but I can say the development of research about human body helps us keep healthy."
NBE02025,"I think so! I reconsidered my sleep style by this article, too. We should take care of our health more! And you should get more sleep!"
NBE01946,I agree with you. Sleep is important for our health. I understand concrete device of the sleep. We should take sleep more.
NBE02323,When I first read this title I was very surprised because I believed that sleep make our brain only take a rest. And the fact that toxin is generated in our brains everyday also astonished me. The article was very interesting and at the same time made me want to know the negative aspects of sleep
NBE02415,I was really surprised by this article and I found it is interesting. Now I know sleeping is important to keep ourselves healthy. I don't think I get enough sleep everyday but I should take longer sleep.
NBE01873,"I realized the importance of sleeping. I knew that the lack of sleeping lead to the loss of brain cells such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease in this article. I really thought I should sleep enough to work the ""waste removal system"" and living a long life!"
NBE02347,I was really surprise to hear this news. This is because I didn't know the brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking. Also after I read this news I realized sleep is very important for us. I love sleeping so that I'm really happy to sleep and work that system and living long and healthy life!!!
NBE01874,I was also surprised to read this article. I also thought sleeping enough time is only to rest my body. So I thought I did not need to sleep long times but it was wrong. I wonder why sleeping so long times links early death.
NBE01659,"I agree with you. This news justified my sleep. If we do not have enough sleep, our brain cannot work and not good for our health. However, you cannot justify your tardy!"
NBE01432,"I feel the same way , because I don't have much time to sleep these days. Like you, my body may have lots of toxins, so I should improve my life style and have enough sleep ."
NBE01891,I am shocked by this article. Of course I knew that sleeping is vital for the health and shortage of sleep does harm to health. But I did not know shortage of health led to diseases. I decided to review my sleeping style with notice.
NBE01247,I became too. I thought to sleep make us more clever. If we don't sleep enough we will not be clever. So I want to sleep more. Let's sleep more.
NBE01972,"I don't sleep well, too. My sleep is very irregular. So I should change my sleep cycle for future myself."
NBE01410,"Yes, I agree with you, and I also haven't heard brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins!! That is amazing! So we should make time to sleep much more."
NBE01486,"I think so too. however busy you are, you should sleep property time. And I also want to get more information about toxins. What kind of toxins it is? How to remove it ?And, How long we should take hours of sleep?"
NBE02780,"I agree with you. The more we know about brain, the more we live comfortably. Therefore, I want to know about brain's function."
NBE02005,Sleeping pattern is related to diseases. This surprised me. I have to change it.
NBE01633,I learned that the sleeping is so important through this article. I don't have enough time of sleep. I have a sense of crisis to not only skin but also brain.
NBE01516,I learned the same thing. I thought it is just to be tired if we can't sleep. But I learned it by reading this article. So I will sleep well.
NBE02399,"I am interested to read your comments. It is excellent that you have decided to sleep as long as possible especially when we have exams. I want to study beforehand so that I can sleep enough through exam weeks, like you have said. However, it is difficult for me to do that as I usually study just before the exams, because I do not feel like studying when exams are not coming up soon. It's not good, is it?"
NBE01800,"I agree with your opinion. before read this article, I didn't think sleep is important . however I learned sleep is important. so I take a lot of sleep from now"
NBE02256,"I was surprised at the news too. I thought that the brain is sleeping when my body was sleeping. After now, I want to treat carefully about my brain."
NBE02179,"I knew a little that sleep is necessary for the brain to arrange information people have. However, I haven't heard that brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins."
NBE02180,"Of course, I have heard that sleep is important for our health. However, I haven't heard that brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins."
NBE02178,"I am interested to read your comments. The more we know about brain, the more we live comfortably."
NBE02467,I think long sleep is not bad thing. But hear too long sleep is not good for your health. So you should keep it in mind.
NBE02287,"I have the same opinion. I knew that it is useful to fix the memory. However, I don't know this effect of sleeping. After I reading thin article, I decided that I would take more sleep for my health."
NBE02648,"I have same thought as you. To get sleep is more important than I think. It relate to our health. Now I often sleep at 2am, I know this is bad for my body. So I'll try to sleep more earlier."
NBE02523,"I agree with you. Sleep is important for our health. We take 7 hours to sleep, and we usually have to clear our brain in order not to sleep in our classes."
NBE02573,"You are so good student! I'm little surprised you at sleeping 7 hours every day. My sleep is often 3~4 hours. I didn't know sleep clean the brain, either. So I'll follow you to sleep more."
NBE02200,"Enough sleep is essential for our health, but the time we start to sleep is also important, I think. I want to sleep before or behind 0 am."
NBE01536,I agree with your opinion. Sleep is important for us. We should take sleep more. (I couldn't log in my account. )
NBE02308,"I felt the same feeling, too you. And I decided to review it. I agree with you!"
NBE01828,"I was surprised by this news too. I think sleep is very important activity for human to live. When I am busy, I think drowsiness is trouble for me. But it is also important thing for our body and it inform us of need of sleep. When I sleepy, I think I go to bed."
NBE01804,"When I read this article, I was very interested because I take a lot of sleep every day but I didn't know the reason why people always become sleepy, so I have wanted to know a system of sleep until now. To know about this research in the article made my happy, because I take a lot of a sleep. So my brain may be very clean"
NBE01716,"I agree with you. We have to change the life pattern, because we tend to get not enough sleep during university life, right? It's really surprising enough sleep make avoiding disease for us."
NBE02328,"I completely agree with you. We are university students and we have to study hard, so our bedtime tend to get earlier and later. We should take care of our sleep."
NBE02451,"I was surprised because for me cleaning and brain are really different words and I can't find any relationship between these two words. don't know the cleaning brain and shrink. I thought shrinking brain makes me fool. So, I was surprised . I thought I don't want to shrink my brain! at first. It was really interesting that brain wash it's self during sleeping. If the research improve, people suffering Alzheimer and Parkinson's diseases may be saved."
NBE01355,"I often try to steady my sleeping time. But, over few days, I am tired of it and give up. Recently, I cannot sleep well, so the fatigue remains next day. I would like to know the good idea."
NBE01756,"This is a really interesting finding. Someday, scientists may invent medicines or something to save our sleeping. Then we could live other ways and the way we work and study would also change. But I want the scientists to leave us the huge happiness to sleep in soft and warm beds."
NBE01293,"Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease are hard to cure, so I hope the scientists can find the way to cure them. However, on the other hand, it is important for the scientists that the Government or something support their study economically. I think we shouldn't make such situation that a creative studies are hard to receive the support."
NBE01267,I surprised when I read this news. I know that sleeping is important for human. But sleeping is more important than I thought. And I think that I need more time to sleep.
NBE01767,"I don't agree with you. These kinds of researches may be useful and innovative, but they are also breaking the habits of human. Many of human morals are based on their lives and habits. So to preserve the moral, we should be too scientific and systematic."
NBE01899,"I agree with you. Now that we know the lack of sleep leads to the diseases, we have to review our life style immediately."
NBE01270,I felt importance of sleeping too. I don't know this effect. So I think that I need more sleeping.
NBE01274,I didn't sleep well like you. So I think I have to change my sleeping pattern. I don't want to have disease in the future.
NBE01275,I sleep longer than you. But I think this is not enough. So I think I should sleep more.
NBE01276,I agree with you. sleeping is more important than I thought. So I decided to review it.
NBE02050,"I agree with your opinion! I didn't know this function, so I want to sleep more."
NBE01600,"I was so interested in this news. Since I was young, I wanted to know why we have to sleep everyday. It is said that our sleeping time occupies 30% of our lifetime. I felt this is useless. But now, I could get information of important role of sleeping. So after that, I will take good care of it."
NBE01608,"I thought so, too. Since I got this information, my sleeping was not good. But I could understand the importance of sleep, so I will mend it."
NBE02053,"Before reading this news, I have already noticed sleep is very important for our health but I didn't know about this amazing function of brain!! So, to make my life happier and more healthy, I want to sleep more."
NBE02906,"l stay up late every night. But after hearing mechanism of brain, I realized importance of sleep. It's surprising our brains work hard while we don't notice. I felt l should go to bed early."
NBE02903,"I guessed it's important for us to sleep from way back. But in fact, I don't know the mechanism of brain. So I was very surprised at brain's cleaning mechanism. And I recognized it important again."
NBE02901,"I found that sleep is important for not only fixing of memories but also washing away the waste toxins. People learn new things, memorize it, and forget it. I'll think a great deal of sleep from now on."
NBE02904,"After reading this news, I feel sleep is very important for us again. Because it can remove some waste toxins from brain and have a big role in the fixing of memories and learning. However the time we need to sleep is so different that I have to sleep more than seven hours but some people do not require much of time. In either case, we cannot live without sleep. So I think it is essential to sleep deeply and regularly everyday."
NBE02905,"Since I did not know about such work of a brain until now, this report made me surprised. Because my sleeping hours have decreased after becoming a college student , I have a new appreciation of the necessity for sleep, thanks to this report. Moreover, it turns out that this research leads to sick research, and I came to wish to know deeply about work of a brain. I would like to look for such news positively from now on."
NBE02902,"When I read this article, I think that sleeping is very important, so I should sleep more. I haven't had enough sleeping time since I became a university student. But to make my life happier and more healthy, I must sleep more tonight."
NBE07076,Finding new things about sleeping is tremendously important because human beings spend 1/3 of their life sleeping.
NBE05372,"I tend to stay up late, so I think I should go to bed earlier for blain to work essentially."
NBE05529,"I have known that sleeping is very important, but I have not slept enough because I had many things to want to do. I came to stay up late, so I am not very tall. I regret that I had not slept enough. From now on, I want to sleep more for my health."
NBE05938,I have heard that sleep is important for my health but I haven't heard that it cleans the brain of toxins. Also I didn't know that the lack of sleep may result in some diseases I think I should reconsider my daily rhythm and take more sleep.
NBE06534,"This topic was very interesting for me. I'm interested in sleep. I knew that sleep has a big role in the fixing of memories in the brain. But I had no idea that the brain used it to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking! After I read this article, I came to realize again how important sleep is. So I want to sleep as well as possible. Although there are many things which haven't become clear yet, technology is developing rapidly and surely. Maybe people will reveal the mechanism of sleep in the not-so-distant future. Then, I want the new discovery help people who suffer from Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease."
NBE06874,"I was surprised to realize this truth. Actually, it seems that learning a think by heart before you sleep is very effective. When I was a high school student, I often carried out this technique. I think it is very epoch-making to introduce the time to take a nap in school and company. If it comes true, you can do efficient work."
NBE07181,"I think we biologically and instinctively know the significant role of sleep since we get tired of everyday's hard work and memorization. Even breezing uses brain to exhale and inhale. When it comes to memorizing something, we consume a lot of nutrients in our brain. Therefore it is natural that we need rest for our brain."
NBE06276,"After I entered into the university, I can't keep early hours. To live my life comfortably, I want to sleep well. when I am sleeping, I feel relaxed , and I am able to live actively next day."
NBE06056,"I'm interested in this article. I can dream night after night, I think it is special. So, I hope that research of dream makes progress. I want to know what is difference between people has dream a lot and people seldom dream."
NBE07151,"I realized again the importance of sleeping. I have thought the role of sleeping is only removing fatigue which l got in a day. But it removes not only fatigue but also the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking. Before we will take an exam, some people study for the exam without sleeping. This way of studying is wrong from this article because we lose a space to take in the things which we remember by the lack of sleeping. In addition, sleep is related with a disease such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, so we must not neglect to sleep at any time."
NBE02125,"What Taro Yamaoto did is said to break taboo and I think so, too. I think the position of emperor is quite neutrality. They are neither ordinary people nor politicians. I learned emperor is a symbol of Japan. However, Emperor Akihito may have known the current situation even if not said by Yamamoto. Because he seems always to concern people in Tohoku. Mr. Yamamoto should not have done such thing or he needed not do such thing."
NBE01997,I agree with this article. We think about the risk of another tsunami or typhoon. Otherwise Japan will be dead nation.
NBE02279,"I think that Taro Yamamoto should resign from the Diet, too. Political utilization of emperor is a prohibited action. This is the rule. I don't understand why he cannot the letter to the emperor, but I understand ""the lawmaker"" should keep the rule."
NBE01379,"I am against Taro Yamamoto. I can understand the feeling that he wants to appeal to Emperor for the risk of the nuclear power generation. However, what he did was overly rash. Many people should felt he did not has good sense and didn't know his place on account of his poor deed. If he is a honest Diet member, it is natural that he knows well the way of the Emperor for the Japanese citizen. What he did can not only shake a neutral viewpoint of the Emperor, but also put forward doubts about character of Japanese politicians. He should consider a little more before act and, aware of the influence of his action as the Diet member. I think such a case does not happen any more."
NBE02491,"Environmental pollution problems caused by nuclear weapons and war is serious in the world. Japanese released radioactivity, which is 300 times the atomic bomb, into the atmosphere and ocean. Japanese have to recognize the importance of this issue."
NBE02492,I agree with your opinion. I think that Taro Yamamoto should consider the risk which political utilization of emperor. Because Japan separate politics and an emperor by reflect on the war.
NBE01919,"I think that Japanese government should abolish all nuclear plants. However, they should not be abolished immediately because of influence of our life. Therefore the government must take the surest safety measures until all nuclear plants are abolished."
NBE02749,"Taro Yamamoto should have acted more discreetly because it would have involved the emperor in politics. However, I kind of understand what he wanted to do because he might tried to change the situation. Honestly, I also have little hope for the Japanese Government because it's been a long time since Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster happened but it hasn't seem to have end of the trouble. After I read the article mentioned above, my thought had a little change because it said that the US and Japan would play a role in the cleanup operation. This news gave me more hope. I expect the operation will work well."
NBE01555,"I think that the action of the emperor Akihito was really great. Because, he handed a letter to a chamberlain immediately and left no comment. I think emperor Akihito understand the role of an emperor in Japan. If the emperor expresses an specific political attitude, it violates the constitutions of Japan. And critics should accuse of him in public, not in the Internet. I also think Taro Yamamoto should have find other ways to express his opinion."
NBE02774,"I think that essentially cause of this disaster is existence of nuclear plant. A lot of people had wanted abolishment of nuclear plant, but the government did not abolish it. Then this disaster occurred, so I think this disaster could be protect in advance. From the above I wrote, I think nuclear plant should be abolished earlier."
NBE01865,"I agree with this article. I really think that nuclear energy is not good for the earth. Originally, there is no nuclear energy. But in fact, there is a lot of nuclear energy in Japan. So I think that we should treat this carefully and decrease this little by little. But I also think this plan is low productive because it doesn't solve this serious problem."
NBE01683,"I agree with this article. I understand the nuclear energy is not good for the our health or the earth. But in this 21s century, a lot of nuclear power are used. I think that it is necessary for us to be carefully when we use this power."
NBE01707,"I really wish that this problem will be solved as soon as possible, and want the government not to cause the same thing again though it's useless to complain about what had already happened. Now The US help us Japan solve it, it'll great if we help one another in the world and have actual good relationship with them in the future. So after Japan's solving the problem, our role will come. There are countless people in need all around the world. On the other hand, I think it's the very time to put all the Japanese potential together! I hope that Japan will become one regardless of who are scientists, politicians or diplomats to solve it."
NBE02154,"We notice that there is always a catch in a good deal in this accident. We have believed safety myth of nuclear power. However, we must be careful with the fault of this power. Japan has big energy problem, so we should consider the future of energy immediately."
NBE01325,A disaster can easily cause next disaster. We know the danger of the earthquake. Moreover that earthquake caused a much disaster. We Japanese feared that disaster. We never want to occur the same But his action is wrong and lacks common sense. In democracy we should do political action by right way.
NBE02376,"I agree with your opinion. Japanese government abolish all nuclear plants is very difficult as long as I think. I think they should abolish nuclear plants in stages. So, we should continue to think about whole concept of nuclear plants, too."
NBE02074,"Recently many people say ""Japanese government have to remove nuclear power plant. "" Certainly, it is true, but I think maybe they are little bit irresponsibility. Because, when government built power plant, people want to make it, and Fukushima people had to move another place, since then, we used huge electricity, but after accident, people say ""we don't need nuclear power plant!"" I think it is too selfish. I think we don't have just to take objection to nuclear power plant, we have to think about how we support Fukushima people."
NBE02077,I agree. I think Japanese government have to abolish. But first of all government have to help Fukushima people.
NBE01580,"I insist that breaking taboo itself is a bad thing. I don't think people suffering evacuation life want Mr. Yamamoto to complain about their plight by such a childish way. He should have persuade other members of the Diet and strive to pass a bill that helps victims as a member of the House of Councilors. However, thinking his difficult situation, this standard way could never have succeeded. It is because he doesn't belong to any party, and LDP, the ruling party, has so strong power that they never listen to the opinions of the minority parties or members. I guess that Mr. Yamamoto realized how small his power to change policies was, and handed a letter thoughtlessly. I hope he will keep making steady efforts to abolish nuclear power plants."
NBE02518,"I agree with this article. In Japan, the disaster often happens, for example, earthquake in Tokyo. We don't know the time when next big disaster will happen. We people in Japan must really consider the risk of second disaster. The best way is to remove nuclear plant without dangerous accidents. However, this problem is so difficult to solve that people in world have to consider new solution."
NBE02669,I don't think this news is such a big problem. Nothing would happen due to Yamamoto's action because we all know Japanese emperor is unable to speak out anything to politics. It is ordained clearly in Japan Constitution. So why do people make a bother about this? I cannot understand. Naturally it is a fact that Yamamoto did a not admirable action but that had almost no impact on actual politics.
NBE01655,I agree with naoeID13018. Japan is the only country that was the victim of nuclear bombing and we know the dangerousness of the nuclear power plant. We have to try not depend on nuclear power and make the world safer.
NBE01624,"I think Taro Yamamoto was so ignorance and the emperor Akihito's action symbolize the role of emperor in this country. Taro Yamamoto could find other ways to express his opinion, so I can't understand his action at all."
NBE02805,"I agree with you. Taro Yamamoto lacks a sense of responsibility as a member of the Diet, a lawmaker."
NBE01951,I agree with you. The nuclear energy is bad in health and danger. The atomic energy is necessary for the present world.
NBE01948,I agree with you. The nuclear energy is bad in health and danger. The atomic energy is necessary for the present world. We should pay attention to the handling.
NBE02346,"I think Japanese government should remove away all nuclear plant in Japan. This is because if a huge earthquake or Tsunami like 3.11 came again, Japan are not be able to revival again. I know there are a lot of reasons to government cannot remove away, but Japan should think more seriously about nations."
NBE02103,"I wonder when the situation in Fukushima will be recovered. There are too many problems there. Not only the direct damage of the earthquake and tsunami but also the accident of the nuclear power plants, and the problem of cleaning the radioactive materials are really serious. The actor of the operation , TEPCO has problems in itself too. Hiding the information, its optimistic but not practical point of view, the speed of the action is too dull, and so on. As long as the actor remains dull and fool the situation won't be improved."
NBE02600,"I disagree with you because nuclear plant is necessary for our country. Indeed it's very dangerous when disaster happens, but it also supports Japan's economy strongly. So in my opinion, Japan should stop old and dangerous ones and make more durable plants as soon as possible."
NBE01513,"I was angry with TEPCO when I read The article. Of course I don't expect TEPCO and its employees, so I'm OK if they get too much salary. But I want them to realize they can rob a lot of life and our health. So, I never want them such a trouble again."
NBE01514,"It's not ""agree"". I wanted to write ""angry""."
NBE02426,"After I read this article, I thought Taro Yamamoto should have acted more carefully as a law maker. I can understand the feeling that he wanted to appeal to Emperor for the risk of the nuclear power generation. But he should not have done that."
NBE02703,"This action greatly affect the future of Japan. So , the best attention should be paid to complete this goal."
NBE01665,I agree with naoeID13018. Japan is the only country that was the victim of nuclear bombing and we know the dangerousness of the nuclear power plant. We have to try not depend on nuclear power and make the world safer.
NBE02258,"This is very glad news for people all over the world. Fukushima nuclear plants have many risks now. For example, typhoon, rain, tsunami, other earthquake and so on. We need many measures for safeness. We must not consider about money. I think that safeness is most important."
NBE02571,My cousins lived in Fukushima at that time happened 2011 earthquake and tsunami. their house is located very near the nuclear power plants so they were forced to leave their house. And they cann't come back here. They think we can never come back and live in our house. I don't want to happen such as tragedy forever. So this news is very happy for me.
NBE02727,"I agree with your opinion. I think many people say their thoughts, making the thing which happens now and then basis of their idea. I really think it is too selfish. We should think more about the support for Fukushima people."
NBE01803,"when Fukushima earthquake happened, a lot of radiation flowed in the sea, and it continue leaking even now. However, 3 years passed, people forget about nuclear plants. We should more consider about our country's environment."
NBE02756,"I agree with this comment because I also think the emperor is quite neutral. Even though I could understand Yamamoto's thought, it was a thoughtless act. According to the media, we can know how the emperor is considerate of Tohoku people. Moreover, there is the rule that the emperor shouldn't be involved in the government. If he break the rule, it will caused a lot of criticism from the world. So, I thought the action of the emperor Akihito was really great."
NBE02707,I disagree with you because we depended on nuclear before the accident in Fukushima.
NBE02784,"I disagree with your opinion. Emperor Akihito is top of Japan so we must have the respect due to his superiors. However, Yamamoto's action is a breach of etiquette. Therefore, it is natural that Mr. Yamamoto is blamed."
NBE02307,"Mr. Yamamoto broke the taboo. It is worst, I think. And I had suspect about him. But some people forgot Fukushima's things. So we should remember about them. I think so."
NBE01712,"I agree with you. the location around Fukushima Daiichi is far from the place we live, but it's problem in Japan. And it influence Japan badly. So the government have to do their best to solve it."
NBE02206,"Mr. Yamamoto's action is not proper as a member of assembly. In Japan, emperor should not have a contact with lawmaker, because it is decided by constitution."
NBE02443,"I am against Taro Yamamoto. I can understand he wants to appeal to Emperor for the risk of the nuclear plant. he is a Diet member, he should consider about what other Diet member critic him and make him disadvantage. In my case , I follow the twitter of him. I support him in anti nuclear power, but I can't support his thoughtless behavior."
NBE01518,"I don't think so. Taro Yamamoto says good thing. Of course all action of his isn't good, but he does almost good actions. I think only Tepco is bad."
NBE01760,"We Japanese can never ignore the problems about nuclear plants. This is really challenging and risky, but no one but us can, and must solve the problem. Leaving them as they are is no longer a solution. I will support the idea to run the risk to make a change."
NBE01896,"This is the very difficult problem. For sure Nuclear plants is too much dangerous. We can't say disaster like this time's case never happen. But IN this 21th century, nuclear power is vital."
NBE01852,"The tsunami which attacked us brought us the misfortune. Although I was in Ibaraki at that time, I thought the end of the world. We were not able to return to Tokyo during three days. Tsunami came also to Ibaraki. Electricity, water service, and gas stopped, and we suffered troubles very much. And there was a radioactivity problem. I do not want to see that panic. I want a country to direct power towards this problem."
NBE01438,"What Mr. Yamamoto did is inappropriate as a member of assembly. I think he broke the taboo because he wanted to change the situation, but I think he should know better than to do such action."
NBE01299,"Taro Yamamoto's action might make him hero, but all conditions, like time, place, occasion made him a villain. First, the contents written to the letter is not worth to handing to the Emperor. In short, FEARS about nuclear is weak. Shozo Tanaka handed the letter to the then Emperor about how the people ""actually"" suffering the pollution. I think Taro Yamamoto is nothing but the fool man."
NBE02907,I disagree with you. Because we have no chance to say many opinion. The action was an expression about complain to the statesman. So I think the action is one of an expression .
NBE01998,"I was surprised to hear that. I think this State Secrecy Bill is needed in Japan. It is because Japan does not has one. According to this article, this new bill will encourage the United States and other allies to share national security information with Japan. In order to counter Korea and Chinese and terrorists, it is also needed. I agree with it."
NBE01619,I am afraid the law will suppress the freedom of press. I want the lawmakers to define the meaning of 'secret' accurately in order not to the law will be applied illegally against constitution.
NBE02592,"In my opinion, I think the law is needed Japan today because there are especially in Japan a lot of spies and the threat of the terrorism is growing. We have to protect the important information. Indeed the freedom of the citizens is also important but the security of our country is more, I think."
NBE02100,"I felt a bit nervous when I heard this news. I understand that this new law is necessary in terms of national security and counter-terrorism, and that Japan's law system isn't strong enough to protect the nation. However , it is not a proper time to approve a law which deeply related to trust against the nation. After the nuclear power plants problem, the government has lost its trust deeply , because of the concealment of accurate information of the problem. As long as the people doubt the nation and unless the government improves its behavior, this kind of law may threaten freedom or right to know about necessary information. The law is necessary but not now, I think."
NBE01649,"I think state secrecy bill threaten the our right-to-know. If this bill carried out, the government easily hide disadvantageous information, for example, nuclear power plant. Also, that means that the government change information. Under this bill, we cannot get correct information. We can say that this bill is a breach of the constitution."
NBE01967,"I thought this bill should be discarded. Shinzo Abe said this bill was needed in Japan because we shred secrets with allied countries. But I think that for example, U. S have a state secrecy bill though they have also a sunshine law ( a public information act ). In Japan, we don't have enough a public information law. This law's definition of secrets is unclear. So I think this bill must be discarded now!"
NBE02795,"I oppose to the bill. I think we have rights to access national information. The law infringes on our rights and this situation may be touch-and-go to make Japan a despotic state. My dream is to be a journalist and to report information for good life of everyone, so I am concerned with the problem about this law very much."
NBE01556,"When this bill takes effect, of course people will not be able to access the information which the state recognizes secret one. For example information about nuclear power plants. Therefore the arguments of the anti-nuclear activists will be suppressed because they can not get information which bases their claims. I think this situation breaks the constitution of Japan, freedom of thought. So this law violates the fundamental human rights. I think that Prime Minister Sinzo Abe should reconsider about the role of the constitution of Japan, people observe the state power."
NBE02493,"Maybe, Its meaning isn't protect our security that this bill was concluded. The ruling party seems to want to return to past. We have to understand importance of got freedom. The Japanese ruling party is becoming more conservative. I want to say them that we never make a war. Anyway, it should not have to decide important such laws in a hurry."
NBE02723,"I do not strongly afraid and think that our lives are infringed by approving the secrecy bill. I have never lived, being conscious of right to know or press freedom. If we know that for example information about nuclear power plants, what we can do concretely?Considering the present international relation of Japan, we need to strengthen the relationship with America or to encourage the United States and other allies to share national security information with Japan. So I basically agree with the bill. However, I cannot admire the Japanese government because the ruling party was so hurry to make the bill that bill's definition is so vague and broad. Regarding this point, we should think carefully, spending much more times. It was by no means praiseworthy."
NBE01999,"I agree with ID13016 thinking. I am also afraid the law will suppress the freedom of press. In order not to the law will be applied illegally against constitution, we must understand this new bill. It is not true that there are only good things about it."
NBE01844,"I was surprised, seeing this report. It is because the government has put pressure on mass media in Japan in which I live. It will become impossible for me to trust the Japanese government. The government thinks that it must not make information secret. It is because Japan has kept our lives."
NBE02280,I don't agree with the secret law. I think that law has the danger of becoming the fear of limits on our freedoms. Press freedom and freedom of thought are very important for democracy.
NBE02126,"Making a state secret bill is good for Japanese Government and other countries. Maybe it was strange that Japan didn't have such law as a member of developed countries. However, important informations should be released to the people, because they have the right to know. I think everything shouldn't known by the people, but the information which should be known as Japanese people should be released."
NBE02393,"I don't think that the state secrecy bill should've been approved. As people in the passage say, it probably takes the teeth out of democracy. People will be less interested in knowing about politics and complain about it. Although I can understand what Abe is explaining, what I do not understand is the the merit of making the bill for us. Is there no benefit for us? If so, I would like Mr. Abe to explain how important it is for Japanese society and how he is going to make up for the opportunities that citizens would have had if it had not been approved. It should not be good to give final approval to it without much explanation to people."
NBE01684,"I was surprised at this news. The state secrecy bill was presented on November 26th and that was passed on December 6th. I cannot be understood how the society will change, but I willing to think about that."
NBE02513,"I don't agree with this bill. Of course, Japan have to strengthen more not only national security but also global one. In that point, the bill is effective. However, the bill has other element that we don't know government's decision-making process. The bill also has bad points to Japanese people because Japanese people have the right to know. I think that this bill of the disadvantage is greater than the benefit. I want Prime Minister Abe to make a new law in order to strengthen both national and global security without undermining Japan's democracy."
NBE02070,"I haven't understand this bill. What will become crime? Many people are making noise against this bill. I can't understand this too. I think we had got few ""secret"" up to now, so I think we don't have to make a fuss right now. Of cause we will have to stop prime minister when he try to get too much power."
NBE01795,"I was very angry when I read this news because the secret law is terrible. Under the this law, people couldn't research about the particular secret, and this secret is decided by the government. So the government can control about the nation's opinion. I can't believe the government because they hide a lot of important information which the nation should know. I never want to be controlled like this government."
NBE01920,"I think that the contents of state secret law is not bad. Japanese government had no effective law to crack down on spies. It is a very serious problem for our country. So we need this law. However, the way to approve is bad. It is natural that some people fear that they cannot protest against the government. The government have to relieve their mind. However, I think Japanese government did not do it at all."
NBE02249,"I am somewhat worried to this state secret low. I have a question not to the contents of this bill but to how to determine. The government approved this bill forcibly. I think that the time of talks was more nearly required. Since having been decided is unavoidable, this bill is wanted to be used correctly."
NBE01427,"I'm against this bill. I have two reasons for this. First, I'm afraid that this bill will threaten the freedom of speech and press. Second, this bill makes it difficult for people to check government decision. If we can't know the information about the government, we can't check anything. With these reasons, I'm against this bill."
NBE02750,"I'm against the new state secrecy bill. The government said that the purpose was to strengthen Japan's role in global security and create a more authoritarian government at home, but I couldn't fully understand the advantage of it. Far from that, I thought there were more risks as Kyouji Yanagisawa said. I also couldn't understand why the bill was passed though many Japanese and foreign journalists, writers, academics and activists had all opposed the bill. Wasn't it the democratic government? This news story gave me a question about a recent political system."
NBE01528,I agree with the secret law. I think Japan needs the secret law today. Because there are especially in Japan a lot of spies and the threat of the terrorism is growing. We should to protect the important information.
NBE02565,"When I read this article, I am afraid of our peace of ordinary lives. This new law punishes the people who talking or leaking the secret of Japan national security. And it means that the state watch us. I can't imagine how watch the state us. It is so scary thing. The state should protect itself from the outside. But this new law is really necessary for us? I can't think so."
NBE02195,"I think some media threaten us too much. By secret law, I think, our lives will not be damaged. However, we should check the law because government may use law inappropriately. To defense and save the important information, this law is necessary, but government should not concern information which should be open to us."
NBE01708,"I feel dizzy. Democracy is important, of course. we need liberty, too. However, we have to protect ourselves from spies abroad and something like this, so we will lose something important which we achieved thanks to many sacrifices. I think that everyone actually knows what is right or wrong, and what we should do, but they're never free from human greed, and some act things just for themselves. However, we should always try to move in a right direction despite any enemies standing in front of us."
NBE01322,"A state secrecy bill cast question that what is our freedom to us. Honesty I can't say a state secrecy bill is absolutely bad. In fact, that law can be able a state to hide contents or incidents that is not good for them. That action trespass on people's freedom, that is human right. While that danger, that law may be useful to stay nation in safe. So I think safe system is needed for preventing authorities from abusing."
NBE02370,"I wondered that Japan did not have this state secret law until now, because most countries have laws like this. There was more concern that this law is established as there is a voice of protest and demonstration, but the purpose of this law is to strengthen the protection of Japans's secret weak compared to foreign countries. So, I think criticism such that there is a risk toward the war to establish this law. Simply because it is a difficult problem with safety assurance, it is a problem that we must discuss also established later."
NBE02152,"State secret law is difficult to interpret. Not only the people, but also politician don't understand the details of this law. However, I think it is not god to criticize the idea of this law. The problem is the vagueness of the text. I afraid to use this law subjectively by malevolent man."
NBE02156,"I don't agree with your thinking. The government say the fabrication in many times. However, it is sometimes necessary to protect nation. If the politicians must say only the truth, the trust of government is broken immediately. I think it is important for us to monitor arbitrary action of the government and to understand the idea of this law."
NBE02460,"I don't know which side should be taken. we need this law because our country have secrets. And it is not good for other countries to know this secrets. But, at the same time, this law can be very dangerous."
NBE02618,"I support the state secrecy bill. Japan did not have spy prevention laws, and so Japan allowed spies easily to steal information. This bill can prevent leak of important information related to national defense. Furthermore, this bill can improve the international relation between Japan and allies. Although there are those who oppose this bill because this bill, they argue, infringes public right of access information, I think they don't fully understand the contents of this bill. Actually, this bill is not very related to the public. The contents that this bill specify as secrecy are classified in four categories; defense, diplomacy, prevention of threats to safety and terrorism. It is meaningless for the public to know information about these categories. Therefore, this bill doesn't infringe our rights and bolster national security."
NBE02464,"I agree with you. Japan should protect the secrets to protect our own country. However, it may occur that this law limit more information than necessary. And this leads to violate individual privacy."
NBE01941,"I agree with the secret law. When I read this news I think that the claim of the opposition is not logical. This bill was decided for a diplomatic reason. However, the opposition pays attention to only domestic things. Of course diplomacy to be more important than an internal affair. This bill isn't the best, bat this law is better than now one. People should think what is important and what is better action."
NBE01581,"I am greatly concerned about this bill. As the article says, this law would allow the government to keep people away from important information by force so that we could not make a political decision. Such a situation is really similar to the one made by Japanese military regime under WWII. Moreover, I was very disappointed because Prime Minister Abe forced to pass the bill very quickly, ignoring all the criticisms and concerns. They should have spent much more time to discuss the bill. I would like Abe administration to listen to the opposite before passing bills by force of numbers."
NBE02020,I was surprised at stating secret law. Because it decided rapidly. I wonder why the government hurried up about it. It was said that the answer was USA's pressure for Japan joining TPP. I think Japan is afraid of America too much. Japan should become a country to have the power and the speaking right. And I concern myself about diet member's concealment increasing by the secret low.
NBE02597,I disagree with you because I think the law is needed Japan today because the threat of the terrorism is growing and we have to protect the important information. Your concern will be eased if the organization that checks whether the information should be hidden or not. Of course its member mustn't be a member of the government.
NBE02079,"I agree. The freedom is so important. If this law will press our freedom, it have to be deleted."
NBE01459,"I was surprised to hear that news. I can't agree with pass this bill. I think this bill can be dangerous. This bill makes Japanese politicians authoritarian. But, this bill can be efficient law. I think this law can be bad or not depend on how to use. I hope this law is used by politicians for Japan's peace."
NBE01405,"This news is difficult to solve. If the State secrecy law is accepted, government can hide a important information and they can change an another fact easy. But further than that problem, every people can get important information is dangerous I think. if we can get a collect information easy, of course all over the world can get it. Now many terrorism are around, if they catch important information, that is really serious problem."
NBE02539,"When I heard this news, I felt it is so difficult. This bill has two sides. One side, it protects the country's secrets. It means it protects us for danger from other countries. The other side, the government can hide information. that are inconvenient for them."
NBE01466,I I agree with you. I'm afraid that we lost freedom and peace because of this bill. It is bad we cannot check government decision. I hope politicians use this law to improve Japan.
NBE02670,State Secrecy Bill was approved at the end against a lot of nations' opposition. Personally I think it was a good consequence though the law still has much room for the government's explanation and improvements. Such a big law has not been decided in the Diet these days so they should have courage to 'change'. It is natural that a number of people disagree with an innovational idea. A person or the government that can persuade those people with good faith does have a qualification to rule a country.
NBE01246,"Recently a lot of law were made, so I can't understand all law. But today Abe will make new law. If the law is very important, if people break promise, the law has no role. i think law should be made a promise."
NBE01384,"I think that the secret low is necessary legislation, however, that the current proposal is not enough. In order to protect the national interest, protection of secret is important, on the one hand, it's right to know what we should also be emphasized. It should be prevent that infringing the rights of our knowledge, and to be abused the law. I believe strongly the need for third-party monitoring committee for this bill. Because I think this bill that we should be improved, I sympathize people opposed. I want the politicians to listen to public opinion all means."
NBE02623,"I disagree with your opinion. This law does not infringe our rights to access information. The contents that this bill specify as secrecy are related in only national defense. We don't need to know the information that this law restricts. There are nothing what the general public can do for national defense. If we throw away this bill for our rights to access information, we will endanger our country to let spies easily steal important information about national defense."
NBE01871,"In my opinion, State secret law should not be approved. I think this low make a bad situation because it means ruling party's secret are forgiven. If there is a lot of rules in the law, it will interpret what they like. So I think this law is bad for Japan's economy"
NBE01406,"That is important point what is ID13016 said. We have a right to know about our country's information. Although, if we can have information at one's fingertips, and anything, that is also dangerous. So I agree with you making ""secret"" clear is necessary."
NBE01872,I also think this is a difficult problem because information cannot be released. Both Japan's policy toward the United State and domestic politic are important. So we should think more about this law problem.
NBE01656,"I agree to your opinion. If we lose press freedom and freedom of thought even once, we cannot take them back forever. This bill threatens today's Japanese democracy system."
NBE01620,I agree with this opinion. I also don't want to my opinion be controlled by government. We should have right to know all information because we are the party of this country.
NBE01332,"I can't agree your opinion in all point. In fact, not only Japan but other country need state secret law to certain degree. 21th century is information era. Information is power or force of each country. So information is very important. But it is in terms of a nation. In terms of people, oppressive law as Japan's is not good clearly and not appropriate."
NBE01945,I disagree with your opinion. This law is intended to protect Japan from the foreign country. The concrete content should be decided by addition. This law is better than before one.
NBE02321,"The bill could suppress the freedom of speech and publish. It is said that the mass media play a significant role in monitoring the government and providing important information about politics to people. So if this bill will be more strengthened, the mass media will lose its role and we Japanese people will lose our rights to know. According to the survey conducted by Mainichi Shimbun, 59% of Japanese people opposed to the bill. The ruling party must listen to the voice of citizens much more carefully."
NBE02002,"I agree with his opinion. It is true that ""there are especially in Japan a lot of spies and the threat of the terrorism is growing. ""They will be bigger enemies than attacking the freedom of the citizens."
NBE02419,I think the law is needed for Japan today. This bill will help not to leak the important information related to national defense. And also this bill can improve the international relation between Japan and allies. Of cause I know that this bill has some problems but I think anything is better than none.
NBE01431,"I totally agree with your opinion, because this law can limit our freedom. As you say, press freedom and freedom of thought are very important, so we should protect these freedoms by objecting to this law."
NBE01333,"In fact, in information age, we have to treat abundant information. It is same to a nation. So important information needs protection. But person's privacy is equal to a nation in terms of importance. In conclusion, the border is needed."
NBE02105,"Yeah I think so too. Japan certainly lacks security against foreign threat or terrorism. The opinion which only focuses on the violation of our freedom, bad point of the bill, is not practical. However explanation against the people and agreements from the people are important, should not be ignored."
NBE02254,"I don't agree with this idea. To be sure, terrorism is growing, but deliberation time is too short. It is possible that government became terrorist if they don't deliberate more time."
NBE02700,We had no time to judge whether this law is good one or not. This can be lack of democracy.
NBE02227,This sounds like Japan is going back to the war-time.
NBE02423,I think this law can make a good influence to the country too. It is true that the law will limit our freedom. But still there are some good point for the Japanese government and other countries. I even thought it was strange that the Japan didn't have such law as we developed.
NBE02228,"Though I admit that your opinion is right for the point of national defense, but I still think this bill will cause more harm than good."
NBE02679,I don't want to see politicians' quarrel like children in the Diet. Surely the way to approve the law was too high-handed but it was also caused by the lack of forces of the opposite parties. They should work hard not to blame the ruling party or government but to win the trust from public people.
NBE02778,"I agree with the state secret bill. A lot of people in Japan fear terrorism. If important information leak, possibility of terrorism will get higher. Therefore, I think the state secret bill which protect terrorism should be carried out."
NBE01485,I agree with you. mass media make a great fuss about this law. This law is necessary to protect secret information of military. But they said as if this law were made to information of the government.
NBE01892,"I strongly agree with this new law. I don't say the opposition is wrong, but I think they can't think wisely. This new law is not completely good but this is better than older one."
NBE02348,"I can't agree with the secret law. This is because I fear it gonna be limits of freedom. This law would be allow the government to keep away from important information, so that we are not able to make a political decision. I think this situation is not good for nation and it will limit the human rights. So that I think Mr. Abe should think about this once again!"
NBE01737,"If this bill is allowed, how can we save our life from nuclear threats?? I think this new bill must be the threat for Japan because I don't think Japan has enough experiment to protest from other country's invading. So I don't agree with this decision."
NBE01663,"I disagree with you. Once we he lose press freedom and freedom of thought even once, we cannot take them back forever. We cannot say what we want to say same as ""Toshokan Senso"""
NBE01248,I think so too. People decide the law in very short time. It will make Japan bad. Because the law is not thinking deeply. I think Abe should think more.
NBE01973,"I think so, too. This bill is not clear about definition of secret. So, this bill must be passed."
NBE02567,"When I know this topic first, to tell the truth, I can't understand the real meaning of this law. I hope this law will work for making good our nation. But hearing the public opinion, new law is as the regulation of our statement. If it is necessary for protecting our country, I don't want Japan to pick us up the right of free to speak."
NBE01974,"I agree with you. THis bill should be passes now. In Japan, differing from the US, a public information act is not established. So in Japan, first, a public information act should be established."
NBE01740,"I agree with you. Why we had wanted democracy so long time, we are about to break our country's security now? We must think this problem first."
NBE02643,"We have the right to all the knowledge what our government do. However, state secret law can take our right. I think it's wrong thing. So I disagree with this law. The government hide some information, I can't trust them."
NBE01586,I agree with your opinion. This bill could be applied illegally because its content is too vague. Everything has both good and bad points. All we need is to understand both sides and to consider what we should do. I believe that the country where people cannot say what they want to say is not a democratic country.
NBE01388,"I think so , too. But, on the other hand, I think that to protect secrets and national interest is necessary. So, I want politician to improve this low."
NBE02755,"I disagree with her opinion because the new law may have the risk which is that the government control the important information. However, at the same time, I respect her opinion because I can understand her reason. In this way, this is a difficult issue. I don't hope the government will be despotic."
NBE01802,"I disagree with your opinion. It is true that this law is necessary to defense country. However this law regulation in very wide range. So, I think we should limit this law strictly"
NBE02466,"I can't totally agree with you. It includes the danger of vague definition. However, this law could help improve national security as well."
NBE02172,"I can't agree your opinion in all point. 21th century is information era. Information is power or force of each country. So information is very important. But it is in terms of a nation. In terms of people, oppressive law as Japan's is not good clearly and not appropriate."
NBE02173,"I understand that this new law is necessary in terms of national security and counter-terrorism, and that Japan's law system isn't strong enough to protect the nation."
NBE02174,Japan should protect the secrets to protect our own country.
NBE02286,"I disagree with you. Because I think that this law is not dangerous for Japanese people. But this law is dangerous for Japan. However, the country is consist of people. The profit of people should take first priority. So, country should not lie and have a secret to people."
NBE02647,"I disagree with your idea. Because if this law pass, the government can hide some information they don't want to say to citizen. For example, they can hide about Fukushima radiation. This information is related our health. If we could not get this, we cannot do anything. So this law should not be passed."
NBE02304,"When I read this news, I think that this law may get rid of rights from us. We have rights. And we are free! And I have the right that I should know about information of the government. So I hope this law will disappear in the future."
NBE02521,"I agree with your opinion. If we lose freedom to know, we cannot take freedom back. Of course, the bill is important for peace among foreign countries. It is true that the bill weaken Japan's democracy system."
NBE02028,"Your dream attract me. I think so that journalist should tell information to everyone. For it, I oppose to stating the secret law, too."
NBE01533,I agree with you. I also don't want to my opinion be controlled by government. We need to right to know any information. Because we are public of Japan. (I couldn't log in my account. )
NBE02201,"I agree last sentence a lot. However, I don't think the bill influence the freedom. The secret information government says is far from our life. Anyway, we should check government."
NBE01825,"I agree with you. Before applying the Secet State law, it is needed to define the meaning the word of secret. If not, it would be used by government and there is risk that Japanese people don't know the important decision making process."
NBE01826,"I think that it is actually important that sharing national security information with other countries that have power all over the world such as United States. State secret law makes it possible to do that. But, on the other hand, it has a big problem for Japanese. The prime minister can govern more smooth with other countries by this law. But Japanese people can't see inside of the policy and decision making process. Therefore, the policy that has disadvantage for people could be applied more easier than before."
NBE02309,I agree with you. And I think we have the right which know about our country's things.
NBE02046,"I understand that this new law is necessary in terms of national security and counter-terrorism, and that Japan's law system isn't strong enough to protect the nation. However , I don't agree with the secret law. I think that law has the danger of becoming the fear of limits on our freedoms."
NBE02731,"I agree with your opinion. Considering the present international relation of Japan, we need to strengthen the relationship with America or to encourage the United States and other allies to share national security information with Japan. But I cannot agree the way the government decide."
NBE02444,"I think the discussion about making the new law is insufficient. The argue of the Diet looks like a quarrel of children for my eyes. We need more information and time to think carefully. NHK news says diplomatic problem between America is important issue. And the government has been its nature of secret before. So, the law makes the government more silent institution. I think the final decision mustn't had decided ."
NBE02330,"I agree with you ID13042. As the proverb says ""The law is harsh, but it is the law"", we Japanese must keep the Japanese law. So we should be more cautious in passing laws."
NBE02401,"I don't think that only important information for people is released by approving the state. What is ""important"" anyway? The government will give us information what it wants us to see, not what we want to see. I disagree with the state secrecy bill because the government tends to hide them."
NBE01351,"We all have ""rights to know"" equally. If the bill is enforced in the future, it threatens to ""the right to know"". Is the bill against for Japanese constitution? Abe government said it is necessary to protect our country from terrorism. I think it is not true. I can't understand the relation between restricting ""the right to know"" and protecting our country. I afraid Abe government will abuse it to proceed his policy."
NBE01357,"I agree with you. The bill is certainly abused in the future. Even if Abe government utilizes it properly, following government may abuse it. I think it is illegal and Abe government should withdraw it immediately."
NBE01757,"Indeed state secret law would restrict our freedom of speech. It is very difficult to save the freedom of people without compromising the order. I agree with the law because we should give the part of our freedom to the government in order to keep the order, and this is the role and structure of modern governments."
NBE01763,I agree with you. What you insist on is necessary to protect the people's right and keep the order in the country at the same time. To make the secret clear is an indispensable compromising of the government.
NBE01977,"I don't agree with you. Because your opinion is not correct. Why do you know in there are spies and terrorism's threat has been growing in Japan. I guess you believe media's report with no doubt. If this bill will be passed, media's reports which you believe are implicitly and publicly controlled by power more and more and we cannot believe information on the paper and TV more and more."
NBE01266,"I think this bill is not good for Japanese people. Because government don't say true information. When 3.11, government's information changed many times. So I can't think that this bill is good for Japan."
NBE01849,"I agree with you. I am also opposed to a secret law. I think that the secret law is contrary to the freedom which democracy has. Surely the information which becomes a crisis also has a state. However, I cannot trust the present government. A Diet member will use a secret law and will leave an illegal contribution etc. unsettled. A state and the government have to get trust first. Therefore, the government needs huge efforts."
NBE02545,I agree with you. It is necessary to protect the important information from the other countries. But it also would protect government's secret from us. So I think the lawmakers have to define the meaning of 'secret' accurately.
NBE01442,"I don't agree with your opinion. It is true that we should protect the important information from spies, but means to protect shouldn't be this low. I suggest so because I think this low can be danger of freedom of speech. I think saving freedom of speech is really important for us, so I'm against this low."
NBE01294,"According to Yomiuri Shinbun, the ""Secret"" isn't about the problems that is very closer to us, for example, about the nuclear plants but about things that are hard to understand for us, for example, GPS data or pictures taken by satellites. Whether this bill truly aims at the defense of Japan or not, such bill is actually needed. In fact, China has a unit for cyber attack called 61398 troop. We should not be against this bill until the government uses it wrongly."
NBE01468,I agree with you. I'm afraid that we lost freedom and peace because of this bill. It is bad we cannot check government decision. I hope politicians use this law to improve Japan.
NBE01271,I think so too. Government should be more clearly about this bill. This is important thing.
NBE01272,I have same opinion. I can't government's information too. And I afraid this bill will press our freedom .
NBE01489,"I think this bill is the need in Japan today. If secret information, such as military is leaked out, national defense and trust of allies can not be obtained. However, I have a little anxiety because the range of the secret is not clear. . ."
NBE02049,"I totally agree with you. I thought the law is too dangerous for nation to be passed, , , but it was passed. so, we have to keep thinking!"
NBE01304,"Your understanding is wrong. The government's decision making process is all shown through the Diet. The other decision making that is decided in the prime minister's official residence is highly political, so we shouldn't get involved."
NBE01601,"I think this decision completely harms Japan's democracy. We have the right to speak freely. This is ensured in the Japanese constitution. I don't think the regulation of freedom of speech will start soon, but it is very bad to leave the possibility of it."
NBE02911,"I think this law will be effective to win the confidence of other countries if monitoring organization functions. Top secrets like this article says should be kept in order to prevent people from exposing themselves to danger. However, this law can use conceal corruption and leaker can be punished unreasonably for self-interest of politicians. Thus, Japanese government must set third party up in order to make precise criterion of this law's application and to punish leakers reasonably."
NBE02910,"The establishment of state secret law is a negative outcome of one-party dictatorship. Japanese citizen often say that speedy making decisions is important for all. Nevertheless, we should have discussed this law more and more carefully before the law is adopted. In my opinion, this low is needed. this low makes politicians and bureaucrats pay more attention to management of secret information. However this law doesn't say clearly what is secret. I think we are supreme ruler and that we can decide whether it is secret or even abolish this low. we are now important point of Japanese politics. Thinking about politics and voting in the election are very troublesome things, but we should be aware of our own country's supreme ruler."
NBE02908,"I think that this law is needed in order to give an alliance a feeling of trust. However, I fear to infringe on this law like a lot of antagonists because I cannot know what is secret. We have electronic devices to transmit information to people all around the world as soon as we get it. Therefore, there is a likelihood that we will be arrested. I think the government should make an organization that decide what is secret. It should be made up of politicians and bureaucrats who respect the will of people. The government should alleviate our anxiety."
NBE02909,"I object to a thought of government (particularly Prime Minister Shinzo Abe) rather than enactment of secret law. In the first place, I think the politician is a existence to help the nation and improve their lives. However, we learned from this time, they are thinking about themselves with precedence and the secret law was approved without explaining it to the nation enough. So, I think it is necessary to consider what the politician should be."
NBE02495,Nelson Mandela is great. Because he fought for resolve the racial discrimination. To solve racial stereotype is difficult. It is thanks to people like him that racial problem is getting less. We have to keep the freedom and equality which is they got. I would like to express my condolences and thank to him.
NBE01735,"In studying history, almost every character keeps its own position based on his benefit, especially during a war. But Nelson Mandela was not. Though he declared to separate non-white from white and began to suppress non-white, he changed his mind and declared non-white's right. He cleaned his sin up in the name of peace. I was moved by his story."
NBE01582,"Mr. Biden said one thing to one side and something different to another. As a result, he completely failed in lowering tensions in the East Asia. Recently, the tension in this region has risen because of territorial problems. China (and Taiwan), South Korea and Japan are very eager to gain territorial rights over the islands in the East China Sea in order to protect their national interests in terms of defense, fishery, and natural resources as well. I hope that all these countries should cooperate to avoid armed conflicts and find a point of compromise. Regarding the US, it should stop too much intervention than is necessary not to change the status quo. Japanese government shouldn't rely on the US, since its purpose is just to increase its influence in Asia."
NBE02671,"Relationships between Asian countries are too complicated so it is very difficult task for Mr Biden, America to deal with it. Visiting a lot of countries in Asia and making conversations with each top was great action itself, however, America is now a little bit losing its credit from the world so those visits did not influence enough so far. Each Asian country must think good relationship with America is necessary so America should keep in touch with Asian countries like Japan, China or Korea."
NBE02940,"It is true that state secret law is important if we think of national defense, smooth cooperation with other countries. But, although there were a lot of disputes about the law, its content is still ambiguous, and it might be used arbitrarily at the expense of people's right for freedom. I think that clear explanation and definition of it should be made for the sake of people. Or we will not be able to control our nation."
NBE02937,"I think the statement that this law has danger isn't wrong. But this law is necessary. These days, information is very important. Leak of the secret information make our country be in danger. In addition, Japan will lose the reliance of other country. So a nation must have the law to prohibit bureaucracy from leaking secret information. Off course, we must supervise the government for some people not abuse it. We should not only criticize but also support the government."
NBE02939,"I agree with you in that information is important and should be protected so as not to be leaked. But even so, the contents of this law is very vague, which enables the government to use quite a few kinds of information arbitrarily. To support the government, the situation is necessary where it is supervised in order not to abuse the law. But for now, I do not have any confidence in the government because of its attitude. If the government do not change, I will not stand by it."
NBE02916,"The reason why I disagree with this is I have the opposite opinion to this. I think this law will not infringe the freedom of expression. Already, government employees are limited to what they are going to say. Thus there would be no change even if the law would be set up."
NBE02914,"I disagree with this opinion. Of course, this law cause controversies. National information need to be protected. Whether secret of a nation is protected or not can decide the fate of a nation. So this law is necessary and helpful."
NBE02917,"I think I'm against to make the law. Because the government shouldn't hide any information to citizens. And if they enforce the law, it might invade free expression. Free expression plays the important role of democracy. So I disagree to his opinion."
NBE02913,"I disagree with this opinion. I think that we must protect our right of freedom of expression, so I think we should make such a film tell us truth. Then, we should watch such things to know the original state and we must solve problems of it."
NBE02915,"Certainly, the government has to protect secrets, which need to defend the country. However, just because the government would deal with secret information, it doesn't follow that the authorities can ignore our rights to know."
NBE02912,"I think a great deal of human rights than freedom of expression. However, I have a second thought that politician should have capacity that can take a certain amount of criticism."
NBE06088,"I think that this is very difficult problem. Japanese government's informations should be protected. It is said that Japanese information leak easily. We cannot get the foreign countries' informations easily. If Japanese informations leak, Japanese people expose them to danger. Therefore Japanese government should protect the informations. However it is important that the nation know about one's country's information. Japanese people have the right to know. No person shall be denied the right to know. Japanese government should keep the balance of law."
NBE06875,"I agree with you. The balance of law is very important. The Japanese government has duty to protect the Japanese nation, so this bill is effective from the point of view that it defends against exposing them to danger. However, the government should protect nation's right to know, too. It is difficult to keep the balance, so I think the first step which the government should do is explaining this bill more deeply to nation."
NBE05490,It is important to get understanding of Japanese people. But it is not easy as everyone says.
NBE02799,"I think we should defend the territory of Japan-speciific. It is important to know the true history and consider about the zone. However, the behavior of Japan or America is very crucial to the world peace because a big war might occur due to this problem. Therefore, the concerned countries should discuss carefully."
NBE02132,"Every time I read such news, I think 'China talk nonsense again, but is it true that Japanese politicians claim to the world?' Japanese politician always claims that despite China doesn't open the certain evidence, they claim that this area belongs to China. Of course I agree this, but Chinese politicians may also think 'Japan talks nonsense again. ' Getting along well with neighboring countries is really difficult."
NBE01561,"China and Japan have a lot of confrontations such as history, political systems and so on. However both countries are so near that I think it is necessary for us to avoid armed clash. In order to achieve this, conference between China and Japan are needed. This conference must be of value because it affects the result of the TPP."
NBE02754,"When I read this news story, I was afraid of the collapse of diplomatic relations among China, Korea and Japan. Because the ADIZ covers islands claimed and controlled by Japan, and a submerged rock claimed by South Korea. I want to them to maintain friendly relations whether Washington has taken Japan's side or not."
NBE02572,"China is the growing for these years and has the big power and influence for Asia. And it always wants the resources. So it insists nearly countries, Korea, Japan and Taiwan, on extending its territory. To tell the truth, I think China's insistence is little unreasonable. Hoping not fighting territory each other in near future."
NBE01713,"It's glad to read this news, because "" challenging government"" is good thing to keep a country good and inspiring other countries like this is nice, too. I think more countries have to try influencing one another like Biden though it's possible to get some countries' diplomacy worse. I believe it really make the world better."
NBE02204,"Now, relationship between China, Korea and Japan is worse. That's because three country claim the domain. Japan has some problem Takeshima, Senkaku. . . I think the problem of domains is very difficult, so cautious remark is needed."
NBE02445,"I think we should defend the territory of Japan own self. But we can't do that ourselves, we need the US to protect our country. And, condition of Asia can't be regard as good . We don't have good relationship. It is important to consider rage of the Japan and around country. I hope an agreement between the these countries was reached through mutual concessions someday."
NBE02352,"When I read this news I was afraid about relationship between Japan and China. This is because China achieved huge growing in these days and very important country for Japan. If relationship between China get worse, Japan will get a lot of damage. So I believe relationship between China and Japan gonna be good and build better relationship!"
NBE01300,"I was interested this article because it is the problems between the world's two ""strongest"" country, the US and China. The US has the biggest economic and military power, but its power gradually declined. On the other hand, China's power is rapidly growing, but the high-handed way of ruling may have the possibility breaking the existing structure, as the long Chinese history shows. I carefully watch the two countries' tactics."
NBE01428,"I'm glad when I heard that Japanese cuisine gets UNESCO heritage status. I like washoku because it's healthy and it tastes really nice. My grandmother used to have her own washoku shop, and I like eating her washoku. So I want to tell my grandmother about this news."
NBE02494,This decision which add to the United Nation's cultural heritage list is a matter of course. I love to eat hot rice with a natto and a grated yam. It can be say that Washoku is just Japanese culture. However diversification of food is progressing in Japan. Japanese have to keep the washoku as tradition. I also continue to love the washoku.
NBE02281,"I think that this is so big and good news for Japan. Japanese cuisine is losing its confidence because of Fukushima nuclear crisis. And Japanese taste is changing to European one. I feel that 'washoku' becomes outdated. So, I expect the UNESCO heritage status to get back the respect to washoku."
NBE01734,"When I heard this news first, I was surprised because I couldn't feel anything special about washoku and I didn't know it was valued highly. These days, we are tending to eat unhealthy foods such as fast foods. Of course they are superior to heritage cuisine at the point of price, convenience and constantly. But we mustn't lose the spirit to be thankful to what give you their lifes."
NBE01557,I was glad to hear this news. Because I myself like Japanese cuisine very much. Shrimps and fishes are fresh and have low fat compared to meat. And the tradition of Japan will be protected thanks to this approval of UNESCO. Also I think this acknowledgment of UNESCO help ally the fear about the safety of Japanese food after 3.11 because official organization approved its value during this period. These facts may get more people regard Japanese food as better than before. And I hope this event prompts Japanese economy through many foreign people consuming a lot of its food.
NBE01710,"I'm very happy to read this news article because I love Japanese food as a Japanese and it's very honorable to receive the status which France only has. When I visited abroad, I saw many Japanese restaurants, but they didn't have enough variety of menu and the quality seemed not to be good. However, I heard some praise of them from foreign people, so I believe Japanese food still has potential to get more popularity all around the world. While we has confidence in our national food, we have to get knowledge about it, because it'll be shameful if somebody abroad hear our food to us and can't answer at all."
NBE02724,"I was glad to hear th news Washoku got the UNESCO heritage because I really like it. Washoku is not salty and not strong tasty. We can enjoy the real taste of food. While various habits in Japan have changed, these habits are still with our daily lives. Of course getting UNESCO heritage status is wonderful and praise-worthy, but I do not have actual feeling because of being a part of our daily lives. And at the same time I think we are too ignorant about Japanese culture and we have to get knowledge about it, not to feel humiliated."
NBE02128,"I like western food and fast food. Of course, I like Washoku, too. It's healthy and beautiful. It's good thing that foreign people become interested in Japanese traditional food. Washoku contest for foreign people was also held, the skills were very high and a lot of new ideas that Japanese people couldn't hit upon were there. Usually, I rarely make Washoku, but reading this article, I decided to make Washoku for dinner tomorrow."
NBE02000,"I was surprised to hear that. This news is good. Because Japanese cuisine gets UNESCO heritage status, Japan can get a lot of thing not only in terms of its cultural heritage and potential health benefits, but also in relation to the economy. I am happy!"
NBE02018,"I'm pleased about Japan's traditional cuisine getting UNESCO heritage status. It may the Japanese good aspect appeal to other countries. And ""washoku"" will be enjoyment for audience coming the 2020 Olympics! And then, ""washoku"" is healthy. So I think to want that it win fast foods. Because I think fast foods overflow in Japan!"
NBE02371,"I was delighted to hear the news washoku got the UNESCO heritage. Washoku is tasty and good for our health. Although obesity due to disturbance of the balance of the meal has been a problem in the USA and so on, if washoku spreads around the world, it might be able to resolve the problem of obesity. So washoku should be ate by a lot of people. And I hope the problem surrounding the food of Japan like ""washoku away"" or ""harmful rumor"" is made an improvement in the wake of this."
NBE02151,"This news is very good news for Japanese people. Cuisine express the national character. Adding to the United Nation's cultural heritage list is honor for us and shows ""Washoku"" is in demand. I want to understand the other countries by cuisine."
NBE01685,"I was happy to read this news that Japanese cuisine got UNESCO heritage status because I like washoku very much. It is an honor merely to become only the second nation after France to have its national cuisine designated heritage status, a decision made by officials at a UNESCO meeting in Azerbaijan. But there is anxiety for Japan to have earthquake and tsunami triggered the on-going Fukushima nuclear crisis, shattering global confidence in the safety of nation's previously respected food industry. I want to think about the problem."
NBE02101,"I'm proud to hear this news. Washoku is certainly one of the best cuisine in the world, because it's not only delicious but also healthy. Taste and its healthiness are strong point of Washoku, but not only that. There are special charm, attractive atmosphere peculiar to Washoku. It often changes, influenced by fashion in that time, or seasons. It's beyond description so it's hard to explain but these are the reasons why I like Washoku, and I hope these appeal point will be recognize by this designation."
NBE02752,"I was glad to hear that ""washoku"" was added to the United Nation's cultural heritage list because it would make ""washoku"" more popular. As the news story said, ""washoku"" doesn't only taste good but also it is healthy, so I want everyone to like it. However, I have heard that people nowadays tend to eat less ""washoku"" and eat more ""Western food"". I hope many people will eat more ""washoku"" than now and appeal it to the world."
NBE01796,"When I read this news, I was very grad because this fact shows that Japanese cuisine is admitted to the world. Japanese cuisine is healthy and easy to eat. So I like it very much. But after the Fukushima earthquake, the rumor of which contents is Japanese food is polluted by radiation spread in the world. I think this rumor isn't right. It is true that a lot of radiation flow in the sea. However, it may be part of all. I believe most of Japanese food is safety."
NBE01845,"Now, Japanese-style food is Japan's representative. Japanese-style food is popular for overseas people. Japan should also become famous because Japanese-style food becomes world heritage. We have to advertize Japanese-style food more. If it is successful, the future of Japan will become good."
NBE01922,"I think that it is very good news for us. I was very happy because I like Japanese cuisine. I think this news means that people in the world appreciated that Japanese cuisine is very delicious. Washoku played a big part in human's sense of taste. For example, ""uID13018"" and ""koku"" was discovered by Japanese cuisine. How wonderful washoku is!"
NBE02775,"I was so pleased to hear that washoku is registered with UNESCO heritage. I prefer washoku to other country's dishes, because I feel washoku's seasoning is most exquisite. I hope that this good news will trigger activation of reconstruction of Japan."
NBE01969,"I was so happy to hear this news. Now, I feel that Japanese are not proud of Japan and love foreign culture and evaluate Japanese culture as old-fashioned culture. But foreigners evaluate Japanese culture as sublime beauty. I think that Japanese should reevaluate our culture by foreigner's evaluation."
NBE01651,I am very happy to hear this news. Washoku use less oil and much vegetable. Washoku keep you healthy. I'd like many foreigner to eat washoku. Miss Universe world congress champion 2007 Riyo Mori introduce the wonderfulness of washoku to the world. She claimed that washoku make you healthy and beautiful.
NBE02458,"Now that Japanese foods is very popular in world because of it's healthiness. And this helps Nihonshoku be UNESCO heritage. I'm so pleased to see this news and proud of Japanese foods. But, at the same time, I think that it is needed to correct misunderstandings of Japanese foods and to eliminate fake Nihonshoku."
NBE02251,"I think it very good that washoku was accepted globally. In Japan, washoku's culture is on the decline now. However, washoku is very important culture, and it must make it continue. It is wishing people that washoku spreads further."
NBE01244,"Japanese traditional cuisine is very good. Because, it is very healthy. Washoku is very good for people. It is not only healthy but also beautiful. Beauty is its shape. Of course, taste is good, but I can enjoy seeing I think people all over the world should eat Washoku more!!"
NBE02462,It is right that some Japanese people don't take pride in Japanese culture. But you must remember that one of the most favorite food in Japan is still sushi. I think Japanese people still have the mind the loves our culture.
NBE01529,UNESCO world heritage is just getting ridiculous. It was originally intended to save and preserve heritage that was in neglect or danger of destruction but it has now turned into an international quango with governments lobbying and no doubt paying money to boast about how special they are.
NBE02796,"Japanese cuisine is very unique in the world. Washoku is very healthy and very delicious. Japanese people love its tastes. However, Western food has spread over Japan, and frequency of our contact to Washoku is diminished. But this acquisition of UNESCO heritage status can be a chance for us to reconsider about importance of Washoku in Japanese culture. So I am glad to know this news very much."
NBE01508,"I'm glad to hear this news because I like washoku very much. I think washoku is one of the most prided Japanese culture, but traditional washoku culture is being changed. We should improve traditional washoku culture again."
NBE02642,"When I heard this news, it made me happy! Washoku is Japanese traditional dish and I love it. I am very proud of it. I want many people to come to Japan to eat Washoku."
NBE01324,"What Japanese cuisine got UNESCO heritage status made Japanese happy. Japanese cuisine has been famous for healthy food. Although the especially famous Japanese cuisine is SUSHI or TENPURA and so on, there are more good taste and healthy food in them. In this time, getting UNESCO heritage state may be good opportunity to be known about more Japanese cuisine around the world."
NBE01327,"I think this mention is important. Recently, we have came to tend to like eating European food, like hamburger and so on. I don't think European food is bad. But it is bad not to treat it valuably. We should notice the uniqueness of it."
NBE01349,"I was glad to read this article because I loved Japanese cuisine. Japanese cuisine is famous as unique and healthy food. Recently, many Japanese food called ""washoku"" is eaten everywhere, for example, ""sushi"", ""tempura"" or ""takoyaki"". I wish Japanese food will be widespread in the world and more people will become more healthy."
NBE01381,"I am glad and proud of this news as a Japanese. Because the Tokyo Olympics were just decided, I hope to spread out Japanese foods more. In addition, there is the already new movement including the Japanese foods contest of the foreign chef, and I look forward to that Japanese foods become major."
NBE01382,"I think so, too. It is necessary that we realize the good point of the Japanese foods again and improve it. Because the Japanese food is good for health and delicious, I think we should protect this culture. If this news become a motive of it, I am glad."
NBE02394,"As many people said, I was very glad to hear this news. I would like everyone in the world to know the art of Washoku with its public attention. Although I do not really like some of the Japanese food like raw salmon, the taste of it, I always notice how beautiful Washoku looks when I get to eat it. Plenty of fish, rice and vegetables with so many lovely colors can be found. Knowing this, it would be great for us if more people are interested in Japanese culture and visit Japan."
NBE02072,"I'm writing this comment January 1st. I ate ""Osechi"" this morning. Osechi has many type of dishes. This is so Japanistic. Washoku use seasonable food, I think this is very good culture. Because, seasonable food is very tasty and affordable price. And we can feel 4 seasons. I take pride in Washoku."
NBE02075,"Yeah, I think so! Washoku is so healthy and delicious! The reason why I like washoku is we can feel 4 seasons in washoku."
NBE01822,"I think washoku is Japanese great traditional cuisine that has to been protected. Now, many people eat western cuisine, because we can eat them more faster and easier. So people have less opportunities to make and eat Japanese food. But, its seasonal food and color are beautiful and it has been made long time ago. This decision make us continue this Japanese custom. We should protect and keep culture."
NBE01584,"Hearing the news, I was very surprised since I had supposed that UNESCO had mainly designated traditional performing arts as Intangible Cultural Assets. It had never occurred to me that a way of cooking could be recognized as a world heritage. Now western dishes are very popular all over Japan. However, this designation showed us that Japanese traditional food culture was highly evaluated in the world and thought to be a common asset of human beings. It is a great opportunity to realize again the importance of passing our traditional cuisine down from generation to generation. We should be proud of washoku and make efforts to protect and improve it."
NBE02593,"I agree with you. Indeed there is food diversification in Japan and I actually love Western food too, but I think that we have to treasure Washoku as our own culture. For this, in my opinion, for example, the washoku museum should be built."
NBE02695,"I was surprised at hearing this news because Japanese traditional cuisine becomes one of the cultural heritage. I don't usually eat it , but I take proud of it after hearing the news."
NBE01460,"I was glad to hear that news. I love washoku. I take pride in washoku as Japanese. Washoku is a symbol of Japanese tradition. I think many people appreciate washoku. Fukushima nuclear crisis threatened washoku, but this news makes washoku famous again. Many people in the world discover new merits in washoku. I hope many people enjoy washoku!!!"
NBE02196,I'm proud of Japanese food called Washoku. I think it is a chance that a lot of foreign people are interested in Washoku. We should protect Washoku from junk food such as hamburger and wi should spread Washoku to the world.
NBE01464,"I agree with your opinion. I love Japanese cuisine very much. This acknowledgment of UNESCO must help allay the fear about nuclear power. I hope many foreign people have washoku, too."
NBE02514,"When I read this article, I felt so happy. There are many culture food restaurants or fast food restaurants in Japan. This is not bad thing because we can eat a lot of foods except for Washoku. However, nowadays people eat more Western food than Washoku, for example, many people eat bread in the morning. Washoku is Japanese traditional food and healthy food which are often used many copious fish, rice and seasonal vegetables. So, I am really proud of Washoku as Japanese people and I want Japanese people to eat more Washoku than Western food."
NBE02566,"This news is so much wonderful for us!! It made me happy. I love Japanese food!These days we have lesser and lesser chances eating Japanese cuisine than before. Especially young people prefer to eat Western cuisine, for example hamburger, fried potatoes, fried chickens and Ramen. So I want them to eat Japanese cuisine on this occasion."
NBE02540,"I was so happy to hear this news. Washoku is wonderful. Washoku draw out each charms with many ingredients to the maximum. It is so good for our health. By having been enrolled in a world heritage, I hope more people eat Washoku in the world."
NBE01943,"I agree with you. Of course, another countries foods good. However it was good a Japanese tradition was evaluated in the world. I am proud of it as a Japanese. I think that you were able to cook a delicious washoku."
NBE02619,"This news cheered us and made us take proud of Japanese culture. Washoku is composed of not only dishes of first-class Japanese restaurants, but also Japanese home dishes. They are so highly balanced in nutritional value and so delicious. However, these days, Japanese people have lesser Washoku than before. This is because Western-style food has penetrated in Japanese food culture. Especially, the so-called junk food is low in nutritional value and contains many fats; for example, hamburger, fried chicken, pizza, and pancake. Therefore, Japanese people have to preserve Washoku, the world-class traditional Japanese culture."
NBE02624,"I agree with your opinion. After 3.11, Japanese foods are damaged by the rumors that they are polluted with radiation. This new can wipe away the rumors and make Washoku more famous. Washoku is one of the safest and healthiest cuisine in the world."
NBE01867,"I am glad to see this news because I love Washoku than fast foods. Of course Pasta, Pizza, Ramen also very delicious, but Washoku has different taste something special. But I wonder how Washoku was known . I think Japanese foods cannot spread to the world. But I also think it should be more famous from now on."
NBE01868,"I also think junk food shop are increasing but Washoku cannot be increasing. I expect Washoku will be famous under the influence of this news. Washoku is very delicious, so it will be loved by everyone in the near future. I am looking forward to. . . . ."
NBE01652,"I agree to ID13063's idea. Washoku is healthy and delicious. However, we eat western food almost every day. Washoku got the UNESCo heritage status, so it is good time for Japanese people to reconsider about the importance of Washoku."
NBE02674,"I'm honored that Japanese traditional cuisine was designated to the United Nation's cultural heritage. That means washoku is getting extremely high status in the world and many people love washoku. In reality, I have never heard someone who does not like Japanese meal. It is super admirable thing. The strong point of washoku is that it perfectly and clearly reflects the noticeable change of the seasons, that is to say, freshness. However, unfortunately people in Japan currently have less time to eat washoku than before. They love American, French, Italian food. This phenomenon is strange to me."
NBE01621,I agree with this opinion. We should protect the culture of washoku because washoku is independent from other country's food culture.
NBE01622,"I love Washoku, so this news made me happy. Washoku is becoming more and more popular worldwide, but in Japan, the original country, Washoku is becoming more and more unpopular. I heard that recent children don't like shoyu or dashi. This fact is so sad. Japanese should protect the culture of Washoku."
NBE02024,I agree with you. Various Japanese foods are damaged and misunderstood by Fukushima nuclear crisis. So UNESCO heritage status cheers up Japanese and Japan economy and so on. I'm pleased it! And I want Japan to go to happy future.
NBE02043,"I think that this is so big and nice news for Japan. Japanese cuisine is losing its confidence because of the nuclear crisis. And Japanese taste is better than European one. I feel that 'washoku' becomes more famous. So, I expect the UNESCO heritage status to get back the respect to washoku."
NBE02677,"I partly agree with your idea. Maybe the UNESCO heritage status gives back Japanese cuisine credit but Japanese people have to keep working. Japanese people themselves do not eat or like washoku recently, instead they often eat other countries' food."
NBE01429,"I agree with your opinion that we have to get knowledge about washoku . In the future I want to study abroad, so I think I have better get knowledge about it before going abroad."
NBE02418,"I think it is amazing that the Japanese traditional cuisine has been added to the United Nation's cultural heritage list. And I think it is a great news for us. This would make washoku more famous and more and more people in the world will have some interest and they will try them. A lot more people have western food at home now in Japan, but we should keep our traditional Japanese food too."
NBE02252,I agree. Washoku is very beautiful. But western food is almost beautiful too. Both food's difference is healthiness. Western food is not healthy. Almost that is high fat. Washoku have many good points.
NBE01407,"I'm glad to hear this news. I really like Japanese foods, so I want all over the world know this taste and flavor. Of course Japanese foods are healthy, good for human body. So now this news made Japanese food signalize, I'm happy."
NBE01950,I am glad to see this news. Washoku got the UNESCO heritage because Washoku is creativity. This news means world people know great Japanese food. I am proud of it as a Japanese. I want to that people more eat Washoku.
NBE01797,I agree with the idea that washoku is wonderful. I like washoku very much too. I having eaten washoku everyday since I was a child. I think we should protect this culture.
NBE01408,"Yes, I agree with you. I'm also proud of this news. You should have more Japanese food! That is good for you to keep your healthy."
NBE01484,"I agree with you. although fast foods are convenient and instant, they are too harmful for our health. And with fast foods, we can't spend dinner time with our family. We Japanese should eat ""washoku""more and spread it to the world."
NBE02422,"I agree with you. I also think washoku is really healthy and good for our body too. It includes a lot of seasonal vegetables, fish and rice. We should keep our traditional food to the next generation."
NBE02230,"I am proud of the news, even though I don't really like the taste of Japanese traditional food."
NBE02602,"I'm very glad and proud of this news because we should treasure Washoku as our own culture. For this, in my opinion, for example, there should be the washoku museum or TV program about washoku and there will be a lot of interest in washoku."
NBE02779,I agree with you. I also think washoku keep human health. I want this news to trigger increasing of valuation of washoku from other countries.
NBE01661,"I agree with you. Japanese women live an average of 80 years. I think Japanese such long life span related to Washoku. We take less oil, and much vegetable. My grandmother used to make washoku for me before her death. I like her Washoku and want to eat her Washoku again."
NBE01515,"I'm agree with you. I like washoku so much too. In addition, I want more foreigner washoku. So what washoku adds the United Nation's cultural heritage list is good thing for me."
NBE02133,"I agree with you. Washoku's seasoning is great. Using seasoning ingredients cost low and they are really good taste. As a proud of Japan, I want cooks make great washoku."
NBE02349,"I'm very proud to hear this news, this is because Japanese Washoku is great traditional of Japan and it should be protected. So that if it could get UNESCO status, this is really good status for Japan and also good for protect it. Also with this status, Japanese people's minds for Washoku will more strict and it will improve. So that I'm so happy with this news."
NBE01739,"I think so too. Because we are Japanese, we should make it important to eat Japanese food and protect Japanese culture."
NBE01387,"I agree with your opinion. Because there was harmful rumors, I am glad if this incident become the opportunity that gather attention Japanese food even food produced in Japan. Now, Western is on the rise in Japan, but the Japanese food shop will be increase."
NBE02284,I disagree with your opinion. This news is not perfect happy news. It is also convey the message to us that the Japanese cuisine is becoming extinct now.
NBE02175,"I agree with you. Of course, although fast foods are convenient and instant, they are too harmful for our health."
NBE02176,"I was glad to hear this news. Because I myself like Japanese cuisine very much. Washoku contest for foreign people was also held, the skills were very high and a lot of new ideas that Japanese people couldn't hit upon were there."
NBE02646,"I agree with you. Washoku embody Japanese culture. Japanese love the seasonal thing, for example the food or the plant. Now is the time to rethink our culture and Washoku."
NBE01924,I agree with you. Japanese-style food is Japan's representative. Japanese-style food is popular for overseas people. So Japanese government should advertize Japanese-style food for gathering tourists.
NBE02305,"We should have culture depend on our country. It isn't same. So we consider our culture as important and love Washoku. They lead keep our culture, I think."
NBE02522,"I agree with you. Washoku is important for us, people in Japan. I really like washoku. Every morning, I eat Washoku, rice and baked fish. We should protect Japanese traditional food culture, Washoku."
NBE02574,"I agree with you! This news is very very great happening! Washoku is wonderful cuisine, healthy, beautiful color and seasonal materials. I want washoku to spread more and more famous around the world, too."
NBE01534,I agree with your opinion too. I like Japanese cuisine. I hope foreign people visit to Japan and eat washoku. (I couldn't log in my account. )
NBE01252,I disagree you. Washoku is very delicious. You should eat Washoku. Let's eat Washoku.
NBE01827,"I agree with you. I didn't think washoku is special meal before. But, after living in foreign country, I think washoku is important traditional food. Without Japanese food, I could not live healthy. Whenever I went to restaurants, there were mainly meat cuisine. I love it but, I wanted to eat flesh fish. Sushi is popular in France, but I think sushi which I eat in Japan is the best."
NBE02202,"I think so. we should protect Washoku, so it maybe good to refrain from fast food etc. They are sometimes harmful to our heath."
NBE01714,"I agree with you. And it's nice, your grand mother had run Washoku shop, she will be really happy to hear this. I think this lead to make the old in Japan do some nice contribution from now on about Washoku"
NBE02730,"I agree with your opinion. Eating European food is being our common. However we are Japanese. When I heard this news , I thought that we should know more about Japanese culture. I hope the time other Japanese culture gets these state come true."
NBE02311,"I agree with you. And I love Washoku. I think we should keep our tradition. At the first, I will continue to eat Japanese foods!"
NBE02326,"I'm glad that washoku was added to the United Nation's cultural heritage list. It is expected that many washoku restaurants will be build, so Japan should make good program for foreign people who got interested in washoku."
NBE02449,"This decision which add to the United Nation's cultural heritage list is a matter of course. I love to eat hot rice with a natto and a grated yam. It can be say that Washoku is just Japanese culture. However diversification of food is progressing in Japan. Japanese have to keep the washoku as tradition. I also continue to love the washoku. Your point of view that diversification of food is interesting . I take seriously protection of history and tradition, but I should also consider the progressing."
NBE02446,"I think it's good news for Japan! I'm glad that washoku is recognized all over the world. These days, Japanese don't eat Washoku so much and traditional way to cook is becoming forgettable things especially in young generations. And in my case, my grandparents own Wagashi shop. They eager to succeed the history of wagashi. I hope the status put enthusiasm into the people."
NBE02447,"I think that this is so big and good news for Japan. Japanese cuisine is losing its confidence because of Fukushima nuclear crisis. And Japanese taste is changing to European one. I feel that 'washoku' becomes outdated. So, I expect the UNESCO heritage status to get back the respect to washoku Fukushima nuclear crisis is difficult problem. polluted water is continue disposing now , It 's no time to say that we lose confidence. The receiving status is really delighted incident, but I think we mustn't forget the negative accident in 2011."
NBE02448,"I was glad to hear this news. Because I myself like Japanese cuisine very much. Shrimps and fishes are fresh and have low fat compared to meat. And the tradition of Japan will be protected thanks to this approval of UNESCO. Also I think this acknowledgment of UNESCO help ally the fear about the safety of Japanese food after 3.11 because official organization approved its value during this period. These facts may get more people regard Japanese food as better than before. And I hope this event prompts Japanese economy through many foreign people consuming a lot of its food. I also expect the profit of the economy by exportation. In addition , if people come to Japan to sight seeing to eat washoku, Japan could get more profit, I hope it is not only temporary vogue."
NBE01356,"I think so too. ""washoku"" is much different from other food culture. I want to eat whenever I visit foreign country. This is a chance ""washoku"" spreads other country."
NBE01758,"It is very nice for Japanese cuisine to be listed on the United Nation's cultural heritage, but I can't think of this news without Japan's strong recommending of its cultures to the list. To be listed would lead to protect culture, but we should not strongly recommend our cultures because it's a shame. I think we Japanese should be more humble."
NBE01976,"I don't agree with you. Washoku's definition is very narrow. Washoku which got UNESCO heritage status is what is called Kyo Kaiseki, not natto. In Japan, pure Washoku is very expensive and rare for Japanese. I think reason this time Washoku got UNESCO heritage status is Washoku has been lost."
NBE01894,"I was very glad to see this news. First of all, I think , The Japanese food is one of the most delicious genre of food in the world. Of course it is also very healthy. I hear that The Japanese food have much to do with the life expectancy in Japan."
NBE01848,"I don't agree with you. It is because I cannot eat Japanese-style food. Fermented soybeans have admiration and an intense smell sticky. I am poor at it. Japanese-style food has many the things and the raw things which were fermented. I regard Japanese-style food as what is called unique dishes having gathered. As for me, such Japanese-style food is seldom to its liking."
NBE01265,"I like western dishes, but I like Japanese cuisine than western dishes. So this news is good for me. Washoku has many good point. For example , it is delicious, healthy and we can feel season from it. So I hope that many foreigner know Japanese cuisine."
NBE02543,"I agree with you. And I think that now is the time for Japanese to know our important culture, Washoku more!!"
NBE01765,"I don't agree with you because I think you don't have to tell your grandmother about the news. If your grandmother used to run washoku shop, she must have known the news. So your inform will be really offensive."
NBE01296,"It means Washoku is popular and known for people all around the world. I love it and I want the washoku chefs to keep its quality. Therefore, those who are involved in washoku should be careful not to degrade its value and trust."
NBE01273,I agree with your opinion. Washoku has a lot of good point. And this is big chance for Washoku. I like Washoku. So I am glad to know this news too.
NBE01488,"Washoku is not only delicious, it is also good to health. So, I really think it is very good that the food culture of Japan has spread in the world. However, there is a tendency for Japanese people do not like to eat traditional Japanese in recent years. Now, we should rethink about Washoku."
NBE02047,I agree with you! I think Washoku helps Japan to revival from the tragic earthquake!
NBE01305,"i agree with you. By being added the cultural heritage list, Japan's image to the other country is better, and the government indirectly gain the political power."
NBE01602,"At first, I was surprised to hear this news. I had a image that foreigners don't like Washoku generally. I sometimes watch movies that they eat Wasabi or Natto and tastes bad. I am relieved to hear that they exactly understand Washoku is not always with Wasabi or Natto."
NBE01603,I think so. We must proud of our culture and understand it better.
NBE02918,"It's great that Washoku, our precious culture, is recognized by people all over the world. Moreover we have to hand down this tradition to next generation. However, in this topic, there is a problem. When we talk about Japanese food, we often focus on only famous foods such as Sushi, Tempra. There are many kinds of traditional foods in Japan. So, I think it's good chance not only for foreigners, but also us Japanese to understand a part of Japanese deeply."
NBE02920,"I was happy when I heard this news. I love washoku as a Japanese!Washoku is healthy and tasty. In addition, washoku is good for the Earth because it use seasonal ingredients. I am proud that washoku was recognized by UNESCO!I hope that many many people eat washoku and Japan will take back global confidence in food industry."
NBE02931,"I was so happy to hear this news. It's because, Washoku will become a famous food all over the world. Washoku is more healthy than other country of foods. So it have the advantage of diet-friendly foods. And also, Japanese cuisine is excellent creation. Japanese chef take in seasonal food, color, flavor and so on. We can appreciate Japanese cuisine. I expect it to spread through UNESCO heritage status."
NBE02919,"I love Washoku and I am proud of Japanese cooks. Washoku has a beautiful appearance, a good taste, and a wonderful imagination. After the Second World War, Western dishes have been popular in Japan. For example, many Japanese eat toast at breakfast. Judging from this circumstance, recognizing the magnificence of Washoku is a great opportunity to recall the importance of Japanese culture. Each person in the world should take pride in their own traditional culture."
NBE02921,"I am glad to hear that UNESCO select Japan as only the second nation after France to have national cuisine. Washoku is simple but intricate and Washoku has a delicate sensitivity. I love that, but I like western food too, so I want western countries to learn washoku and protect their own food culture."
NBE02926,I was so happy when I heard the news. I was proud of the Japanese culture that was observed in the world. And I want people who come to Japan to know the taste of the real thing. I want you to come to Japan to people all over the world.
NBE02928,"Thanks to the article, I realized that food was not only for our health but also played important roles for our culture, economy, and so on. Especially, I sympathized Mr. Aoyagi's saying, ""Washoku is also regarded as important as it creates a feeling of social cohesion. "" I think the honorable status, intangible cultural asset, will develop our identity as Japanese."
NBE02923,"I'm really proud of""washoku. "" It's elegance, thoughtfulness of creators, ingredients of the season, and delicate dishes, even if we take anything, I think, there are no traditional dishes like""washoku"" in the world. Today there is the tide of the times of fast food, but ""washoku""would remind us what is important about our diet."
NBE02932,I agree with you. I think the fact that Japanese cuisine gets UNESCO heritage status effects a good change in the Japanese economy. And I think it is also a good chance to know Japan for people all over the world.
NBE02924,"I like ""washoku""very much, so I am delighted for ""washoku"" to become popular among foreigners. Now health-conscious people are increasing all over the world. I think that the demand for ""washoku"" will increase more."
NBE02927,"I strongly agree with you. I think Japanese foods have sometimes mysterious tastes for foreigners, but this is very traditional and complicated, so we should be proud of them. Especially, their appearance are so beautiful. Our national characteristic largely reflects them, so knowing Japanese foods as UNESCO heritage can inform of Japan and Japanese people widely."
NBE02929,I think so to. Washoku is a value based on a society's culture for Japanese. I wish many foreigner
NBE02930,I think so too. Washoku is a value based on a society's culture for Japanese. I wish many people around the world have it and know how delicious it is.
NBE02922,"When I read this article, I was surprised by it. WASHOKU is good taste and healthy. BUt sometimes it is not good taste for foreigners. So I was happy for WASHOKU to be recognized."
NBE02925,"I agree with you. I like ""washoku""very much, so I am delighted for ""washoku"" to become popular among foreigners. Now health-conscious people are increasing all over the world. I think that the demand for ""washoku"" will increase more."
NBE05257,"I was so glad to hear this news. Because I like ""washoku"" very much. I think ""washoku"" is very healthy and delicious. Perhaps, almost all Japanese like ""washoku"". I think many people all over the world heard this news and they were interested in Japanese traditional food ""washoku"". I would like them to know taste of ""washoku"". And I would like them to be interested in other Japanese culture."
NBE06927,I agree with you. washoku is important to live long. This is why Japanese people live long. We have to save Washoku!
NBE05797,I think that you are saying the right thing. We should obviously have washoku if you want to be in good shape. It is so good for health and it also makes you in good shape too! Why would you want to have fast food when you can get Washoku!
NBE07211,"It is very happy thing to be celebrated my country's cuisine. I have eaten Japanese dishes for about 20 years, and know the good and healthy taste of that. So I wish this will have more long history."
NBE02933,"I think washoku is wonderful culture and asset which Japan should be proud of. Now, Japanese officials are negotiating with other countries over TPP. I think Japan is not good at diplomatic negotiation. However, we have the great cultural heritage ""washoku"". In washoku, it is important to make use of materials and the climate of Japan and crops, livestock products and marine products which are raised in Japan. We have to show off the value of washoku and the importance of that crops, livestock products and marine products of Japan own are protected. Then, TPP negotiation and the economy may take a turn for the better by a brand power of washoku."
NBE06237,"It's valuable and honorable that washoku was registered as the UNESCO heritage in 2013. I'm proud of many people eating washoku all over the world. Wherever we travel to, we can enjoy eating washoku. However, some of them are far from traditional Japanese cuisine. I think it is important to teach genuine washoku to foreign countries."
NBE06661,"I'm a Japanese people, but I don't like Japan's traditional cuisine, known as ""washoku"", actually. I felt that it is wasteful not to understand merit of it. So I want to tell many charms of it to various people. In addition, I think it is good chance for Japan. Although western food is delicious, Japanese cuisine has other merit. We should protect it."
NBE07296,"I was filled with pride on hearing of this news. Washoku's designation as an Intangible Cultural Asset is likely to have only positive impacts on Japanese people, society and economy. I think the fact that washoku has been added to the United Nation's cultural heritage list means we all Japanese pledged worldwide to inherit washoku. However, as the article says, it is true that washoku has been declining. It is Japanese that are responsible for succession of washoku. So, I want to contribute to that by learning the way to cook from my mother, not depending on fast food."
NBE05701,"Probably, many Japanese people is proud of own culture. Needless to say, me too. But, I think Japanese culture is no longer seated Japanese living because of importation European culture. This news have potential to retrieve position what Japanese culture was."
NBE05731,"I think Japanese people have to eat washoku more. If we don't eat them, we lose one of our tradition. So, I eat rice and miso soup every day."
NBE07328,"I used to hesitate eating raw fish food, but when I took part in an international party, people from other countries strongly recommended me to try. From that time, I came to like Japanese cuisine. I'm so happy that Washoku is attractive to people all over the world and the fact UNESCO accepted it. I hope this will trigger to people who have a prejudice like me."
NBE06354,"I think we can keep our health by eating Washoku. So, when I cook something, I always care about nutritional balance for my body. I consider that it lets to long life."
NBE05913,"Now , people like to eat fast food. But fast food is not good to our health. Therefore , there are many people who are obesity. However , in contrast to fast food , ""washoku"" have merits of our body. So, I'm glad when I read this news. I hope that this matter lead good things."
NBE05225,"I was happy to hear the news. I think Japanese food which is called ""washoku"" is the world's greatest cuisine. It is healthy and delicious. Although fast food is also tasty, it is bad for our health. When we eat fast food every day, it may lead to disease. We had better eat washoku every day for our body. I hope more and more people around the world to know about washoku and try to eat it."
NBE05832,"I was glad to hear the news that ""washoku"" known as Japan's traditional cuisine had been added to the United Nation's cultural heritage list. I strongly think that Japanese love ""washoku"" because ""washoku"" has a lot of seasonal foods. For example, ""JT002"" is a spring food, ""somen"" is a summer food, ""kurigohan"", in English ""marron rice"", is an autumn food and ""oden"" is a winter food. Therefore, we can feel four seasons a year, Japanese people are never tired of foods we eat. In conclusion, Japanese people love ""washoku"" because ""washoku"" makes us notice four seasons."
NBE06057,"In this year, we heard only happy news about UNESCO heritage status. Although, we has a problem with Korean. I hope the excitement cools down and UNESCO heritage status won't never sow the seeds of discord."
NBE05196,I am very happy to hear the news. I like Japanese cuisines and I want foreign countries people to know how good it is. Japanese foods have seasonal changing we can enjoy. I think it is rare characteristic of our foods
NBE06353,"I know many countries are interested in the Japanese food, but I did not expect ""washoku"" to gets UNESCO heritage status. Fast food is popular among young people. However, young people should care about their health. I hope that ""washoku"" are known as a healthy cuisine by this news in the world."
NBE06957,"This summer, I went to the United Kingdom to study English. I was very surprised to find many Japanese food restaurants. In the United Kingdom, Japanese food is very famous and popular, especially for young women, because it is low in calories, good for health and delicious. However, Japanese food which was sold in the United Kingdom was far from ""true Japanese food "". It was difficult for me to explain what it was. It seemed like Japanese and Korean food. I think this situation happens all over the world. Of Course, I know there are some restaurants where sell ""true Japanese food"" in the world. I want many foreign people to know ""true Japanese food"" and know its wonderfulness, so I was happy to hear this news."
NBE06956,"I agree with your opinion that Japanese foods have seasonal changing we can enjoy and it is rare characteristic of our foods. Many countries don't have seasonal changing, so we should proud of the fact. Japanese food reflect the advantage, so I also want many foreign people to know its wonderfulness."
NBE01709,"I'm impressed to read this news article. How surprising a person who had been in prison for as many as 27 years changed the country! Now I believe that important thing is not to give up anytime if something terrible happen, and not to look at the past but the present for the future to find what we really should do. Even if we stumble and lose our hearts, Nelson will encourage us not to give up by memory of his great achievement."
NBE01558,"I admire Nelson Mandela's courage against authoritarian government. Thanks to him, the political system of South Africa changed. I think democracy is necessary to get rid of discrimination. So, now I want many african young people to try to bring democracy and freedom to the non democratic country. I know it is very difficult, but I think it is the people that changes the political system of a country and found a nation where there is no discrimination. Also other democratic nations should help achieve this. For example Japan can use its ODA to teach the way to change the administration systems or help countries do development of laws."
NBE02127,"I didn't know Nelson Mandela well, so I read other article about him and I knew that he lived to be 95 years of age. I think it's enough. His anti-apartheid campaign was eventually succeeded. President in South Africa said ""Our nation has lost its greatest son. "" Thank to his effort, many people was saved. In their mind, he will continue to live. I pray his soul may rest in peace."
NBE02001,"I was surprised to hear that. ""When Mandela was finally released 27 years later, his biggest concern was not revenge for his mistreatment, but making sure that the country remained together. ""This is very positive thinking. And he held public hearings, the truth and reconciliation commission (TRC). He is great."
NBE02153,"Honestly, I didn't know Nelson Mandela and understand the greatness of him. However, I feel the importance of the will. In spite of the imprisonment for 27 years, his will didn't change. Therefore, his will encouraged many discriminated people and changed the political system. He taught us the greatness of indomitability."
NBE02372,"I think Mandela can be said to be the person had South America been reborn. We will never let race discrimination like apartheid again. And we should strive for making ""rainbow nation""that coexist with people of having a different skin color. This word was introduced by Mandela. Recently, the news that a sign language interpreter had used inappropriate sign language at the Mandela's memorial service is focus much on, but we don't forget mourning for the late Mandela."
NBE02751,"Many people might mourn over Nelson Mandela's death. I was also one of the such people because I had respected him for his brave action. During the time of discrimination, he had never given up opposing to it in spite of severe situation. Moreover, after he released, his biggest concern was making sure that the country remained together instead of revenge for his mistreatment, and he held public hearings, TRC. When I learned about this, I even more admired him for his indomitable spirit and tolerance."
NBE01921,"I was very shocked because I respected him very much. I think that he was the most greatest person in the 20th century. I want to follow his bravery and mental strength. However, South Africa is one of the most differential countries in the world even though Mandela governed this country. I worry about the future of the country."
NBE02250,"I did not know Mandela's achievement in detail. However, I also heard this news and became somewhat sad. A movie called Invictas became the cause for me to get to know Mandela. I would also like to become a great human being who can hand down a name to future generations like him."
NBE01968,"I was so sad to hear this news. I learned about his achievement in the world history. He fought for racial equality in Republican Of South Africa. Now, in Republican Of South Africa, black and white are living together. His achievement is so great."
NBE01650,"I was very surprised to read this article. He was a brave man. He protested against racial discrimination and make The South Africa equal country. Maybe he had many difficulties, however he overcome all of these. We lost great person."
NBE02459,i'm so sorry to hear this news. I do not know this achievement in detail. But everybody knows he did a lot to solve racial discrimination. And Racial discrimination is not the past thing. There is still this kind of discrimination now. So it is the time to remember his achievements.
NBE02463,I totally agree with you. We should respect him and eliminate racial discrimination.
NBE02071,"I was shocked. The world lost shine. I think he was the greatest person ever. And I think he was loved many people especially reporter, because every article tell us only his greatness. There're no abuse in the article. Mandela R. I. P."
NBE02019,"I told him thanks. He is a just and tolerant symbol in the world. He had appealed black persons' rights! And they could get rights. If I were him, I must seek revenge on white persons for something until now. But he didn't it. He had not had prejudice. So we should know his policy more. And I want to be a tolerant person as he. I pray that his soul may rest in peace."
NBE01383,"I think him to be the one of the great man. Usually, even if we had a purpose like him, it is rare that we act as he did , and I think that there are some situations that can not improve, if there is not a person like him. I think he left big hope and achievement."
NBE01688,"I do not know Mandela at all, but I know that he was a great man for the world. If I have a chance to know him, I learn about acts that he did."
NBE02377,"I agree with your idea. The great thing of Mandela is that he had not had prejudice about white person. We should be a tolerant as he. I felt tempted to tell him thanks, too."
NBE01823,"I think Mandela left a big achievement. As a South Africa's first black president, his action had great meaning. At the same time, other countries watch his movement carefully, so he took heavy responsibility. I think he had influence on all over the world, because he acted positively even after having been sent to prison. He became a good model for other countries where there are many black people."
NBE01583,"I was very shocked to hear the news and mourned over his death. Many people must have been moved by his activities that trying to help those who had been horribly discriminated against. I believe that he contributed to make South African and African people be proud of themselves and gave them power to protest against apartheid policies. Now the great leader has gone. We must take over his will, and strive to get rid of segregation until all the people on the earth can live peacefully."
NBE02595,I agree with you. I learned that what truly makes people happy isn't revenge but pure spirit and effort for people or country from Mandela and Gandhi.
NBE02696,"I know his name and achievement by studying world history , but I don't know what he exactly did. After reading this news , I researched his achievement and this effect deeply. I think Nelson Mandela is the best politician of all the times."
NBE02078,"I think so. Mandela was the best person. As you said, South Africa has the gap between poor and rich. I think the current government have to face and deal that problem. If they ignore the issue, Mandela will be sad."
NBE01942,"I thinks that South Africa lost the great person. He still has a big influence on the world. He was behind bars for 27 years, however he did not give it up. It point is that we should respect most. People like him what was to live a long life. I'm afraid it."
NBE01509,"I was so surprised to read this article because I respected him. When I watched a legal drama, the hero said that the real devil is huge consensus. White used to control the world. So nobody can act for the solution of race discrimination, but he fought against race discrimination. Race discrimination is tempered as a result."
NBE02516,"I felt so sad because I really respect him. I think that he is one of the greatest people in the world. He has achieved great things, for example, TRC. He is a person who has a strong sense of justice and he fought with ruling party in the cause of justice. Justice which depends on circumstances is not a justice, in my opinion. In that point, he could really take action for the justice. I admired him for his spirit and tolerance."
NBE01467,I think he was a one of the greatest men in the world. His name is known widely in the world. We lost great man. I'm so sad. We try to do anything like him. His death gave me motivation. I mourn the death of him.
NBE01869,"I did not know him very well. I heard his name in the class of social study. So when I heard this news, I do not think more things. But, now I think his death is a big loss for the world because there is not any person who change bad system like apartheid. We have to follow his example and make better world."
NBE01870,I do not know him very well but I also want to admire him for his spirit and tolerance. I want to be a person who can fight with ruling party but it is very difficult because it means I also have to make a effort like him. And I need talent for it.
NBE02798,I pay tribute to Nelson Mandela. He was courageous to act in order to realize the world where anybody is equal. He challenged to eliminate racial discriminations. His activity was great and had a significant impact on the current peace. R. I. P.
NBE01653,"I agree with ID13050. I did not know his achievements in detail. However, everyone knows that he is great and he did a lot to solve racial discrimination problem. We have to take over his belief and fight against racial discrimination."
NBE02673,Nelson Mandela was a great person. We all have to mourn for him. To abolish racial discrimination takes an incredibly hard work and long time so most of us cannot believe or would not take some action by oneself to realize it though we all want the world without discrimination. I admire him for his resolution that he was willing to be arrested or in custody to achieve the big dream.
NBE01623,"Nelson Mandera is honorable person. Almost all of us hope the discrimination would disappear, but we can't take some action to solve any problem. To a grater or less degree we also all have prejudice. So we can't claim that discrimination is bad in public in big voice , which Nelson Mandera did."
NBE01329,"First of all, I mourn over Nelson Mandela's death. As a person in 21th century, we should strive more for making ""rainbow nation""that coexist with people of having a different skin color. He may live forever in our mind."
NBE01430,"I know your feelings, because I was also shocked when I heard this news . I know him well because I learned about him in the English class and in the history class, and I respected him very much. I was also worried about the future of South Africa, because this country lost a grateful man."
NBE02253,I think so too. He had big influence all over the world not only black people but white people. But he was not a special person. He was a normal people. All of black people are like him.
NBE02420,"I also agree with you. As we learned in history classes, we all know Mandela is great. Now he had passed away, but the people in South Africa should face the problems they have now and they should keep trying to make the better country for themselves."
NBE02104,"There are various opinions against Mandela. However I think he is a honorable man. The fact that he fought against discrimination and that he made the first step to change South Africa is admirable. We must learn from him, I think. We must learn the spirit to fight against injustice even in a severe situation. However I don't think fighting or protesting is the only way to deal with severe situation, I highly evaluate his way of living."
NBE02777,"I think that Nelson Mandela is one of the greatest person over the world. His speech and action changed South Africa. I was so surprised that he had been taken into custody to fight against apartheid. Therefore, I was shocked by his death."
NBE02229,"I have read about him only in textbooks of History, but I know that he had fought for his brotherhoods. May his spirit stay in the land of South Africa."
NBE01409,"Nelson Mandela is one of the most nice person of this world for me. He has really strong passionate, I have been respected him since when I learn about him at junior high school. When I read this topic I was really surprised, because he had been in prison for as many as 27 years! I can't believe that, and I moved his life."
NBE01798,"I agree with your idea. I never know about Mandela up till now, however I learned about him in history class in the other day. He is very great person! I want to be man like him."
NBE02398,"I am ashamed of my ignorance of history. I have heard about him a couple of times, but I didn't really know about him actually. Since he died, I came to notice how great person he is that he made an effort to stop discrimination at the time when that kind of insistence is disliked. From now, I want to study about not only him but also people who have done great things in the past. Then I want to be the person who can explain amazing stories of historical people to my future children."
NBE01662,I agree with you. I guess not so any people in Japan know his achievements well. However we should know his achievements and we have to take over his belief and fight against racial discrimination.
NBE01893,"I was very shocked by this news. Nelson Mandela is one of the greatest people in 20th century, I think. His bravery and decision was second to none. I hope South Africa become more developed."
NBE02351,I agree with your idea. This is because we should more respect him and eliminate racial discrimination. I think for this he is really great person and his characteristic is special.
NBE02782,I agree with you. He is one of the greatest person in the world. I think that his death is a great loss.
NBE02233,I totally agree with you.
NBE02644,Nelson Mandela is great person. I work part-time at Fuji TV and I watched many news of his death. I learned what he did. A lot of dignitary from the world came to his memorial ceremony. It shows how great he is. May his soul rest in peace.
NBE02705,I agree with you. We should respect him because he abolished racial discrimination.
NBE02177,I guess not so any people in Japan know his achievements well. However we should know his achievements and we have to take over his belief and fight against racial discrimination
NBE02285,A lot of people must prayed that Nelson Mandela would not die. He saved many people. He made many people be smile. He brought happiness to everywhere. He is a great person. I respect him forever.
NBE01925,"I think so. I respected him very much. It is true that even if you have purpose like him, it is rare that you act as he did. I think that he was the most greatest person in the 20th century, too. I want to follow his bravery and mental strength."
NBE02044,I did not know Mandela's achievement in detail. However I was surprised to hear that Everybody knows he did a lot to solve racial discrimination. And Racial discrimination is not the past thing. I think he had influence on all over the world and Nelson Mandela is the one of the best politicians of all the times.
NBE02728,"I was not surprised when I read this article because I had already known this news. I have known him by studying world history. By being these person like him, now we can live in the peaceful world. I hope the South Aflica more develop and prosper. I respect him strongly and forever."
NBE01251,I know too. He is very popular person all over the world. I want to be him. I want to be person written on textbook.
NBE01535,I agree with you. We need to respect him and eliminate racial discrimination. (I couldn't log in my account. )
NBE02029,"Yes, he encouraged many discriminated people. I think we should respect his mind."
NBE02203,"I was surprised at this news because he is great people all over the world, but in Japan, I feel, there're a few news. We should not forget him and apartheid."
NBE02327,There is no doubt that Nelson Mandela was one of the greatest people in the world and history. He told us so many things. We should greatly respect his patience to overcome the sorrows of many persecution.
NBE02450,"I didn't know Nelson Mandela well His anti-apartheid campaign was eventually succeeded. President in South Africa said ""Our nation has lost its greatest son. "" Thank to his effort, many people was saved. In their mind, he will continue to live. I pray his soul may rest in peace. I also didn't know about him. I feel some irony of world that a great person are become famous after they died like some writers and artist. I could know Nelson Mandela contributed much to make equality society by this article."
NBE01359,I agree with your idea. I respect him and I'm so sad to hear this news. He must be one of most greatest person in the world. We should take over his will.
NBE01761,"He was a great person, and we lost a very important piece of human history. He had something that many of us don't have. He had a strong will to make a change, and never gave up even in the most severe situation. Most of us were born with many rights and take them for granted. To remember these great people's feats may get us to think about our lives again, and then we can live more beautiful lives."
NBE01975,"I don't think his all achievements are great. He resorted to violence to get a Black Rights. He was not always great person. But he changed his thought and he solved the problem. Finally, he became a first president as black. So I want to praise not only his achievements but also his mind of brave to change his thought for peace."
NBE01853,"Nelson is a very wonderful person. We the yellow-skinned races were also segregated by race from ancient times. It is difficult to fight with racial discrimination and to solve racial discrimination. I think that discrimination has decreased now, thanks to Nelson etc. It is the favor which we can also be committing overseas more globally than ancient times. We have to appreciate. I think that a difficult problem will also fight like him."
NBE01437,"I was really shocked when I heard he died. I know him well because I learned about him in the history class and in the English class and I respected him very much. I was also worried about the future of South Africa, because this country lost a grateful man."
NBE02544,"I was shocked to hear this news. As we learned in history classes, we all know Mandela is great. He has a strong sense of justice and he has achieved a lot of great things. We don't have to forget what he did in Africa and the world forever."
NBE01766,"I agree with you. He was great because he never gave up resisting the apartheid, and changed the world. Despite his some mistakes, I totally respect him."
NBE01295,"I learned his achievement in the class of world history last year, so I know how great he is. it is unforgettable that all of his actions that is not simply aimed at the liberation of Black people but aimed at the equality of all people. As a result, South Africa has grown rapidly recently. I mourn for his death and I never forget his achievements."
NBE01277,"When I was high school student, english's text book said about him. So I know him before I heard this news. And I know that he is very important for Africa. So I was very sad."
NBE01491,"I agree with you. He did not revenge, and moved in order to improve the world. We should respect this noble spirit of his."
NBE02048,"I think your power of expression is so amazing!!! I totally respect him very much, , , , he was great person for us! Mandela R. I. P."
NBE01604,I agree with you. His great characteristic finally abolishes Apartheid.
NBE02938,"I have watched a movie whose main character is Mandela! He was great in that he never gave up getting along with people who had persecuted him. Finally he became the President of the Republic of South Africa. Now he isn't in this world, his efforts should be praised by all people and handed down from generation to generation. ."
NBE02934,"When I was a high school student, I often found his name in the world history textbook. The textbook said he fought for human rights. If he didn't do anything , many black people were still treated unfairly. So I respect him."
NBE02936,"When I heard this news, I felt very sad because I esteem him. When I heard the story of his life for the first time, I was impressed. I think we should remember his effort and achievement."
NBE02935,I feel very sad when I heard the news because I personally respect him. South Africa was famous for its racism which was called apartheid. I think Nelson Mandela gave us some hints to live peacefully with another race and I hope his will will never be perished and we will take over it.
NBE06166,"Seeing this news article, I was surprised other countries regard the ANC as terrorist. Nelson Mandela was one of the politicians in 20th century. We never forget his achievement and apartheid. I believe that all people in the world should think about racial discrimination."
NBE05675,"I respect him because he had the firm brief and withstood adversity as a representative of black people. I think Nelson Mandela encourage not only South African but also all black people In the world. Actually, the fact Mandela become the President of South Africa was the opportunity that the right of black people was improved."
NBE06928,"I felt the same feelings of you. I don't have a strong will, so I try to take in Nelson Mandela's will. And also I will encouraged many discriminated people and changed the political system."
NBE05798,I was so happy about the fact that his anti-apartheid campaign was eventually succeeded. And I think it is great that someone tells you that you are the greatest son in the nation after the one is dead. I think we should pray for him too.
NBE06415,"I was surprised to hear that. "", His big concern was not revenge for his mistreatment, but making sure that the country remained together when Mandela was finally released 27 years later. ""This is very positive. And he held public hearings, the truth and reconciliation commission . He is fabulous."
NBE07212,"I knew Nelson Mandela as a historical figure. So when I heard this news, I was surprised to know him as a man of today. I thought I should be curious about what is going in this world now."
NBE06139,"I was very surprised to read this news. The reason is that I had expressed great interest in the Nelson Mandela of thinking and behavior. That his death is very sorry for me, but I'm anxious that the people who inherit of his will and ideas appear."
NBE05833,"Nelson Mandela was not only a patient activist but also a great leader. Although he was caught in prison for a long times, he led and acted for human rights of non-white people. After his releasing from prison, He became the leader of ANC. He led ANC powerfully and he and ANC succeeded to extinguish the apartheid regime. ANC was a very large organization, but he led the very large organization well. ANC didn't succeed to extinguish the apartheid regime without a great leader like Nelson Mandela."
NBE06206,"I remember I was very shocked when I heard the news. Nelson Mandela, I think, is one of the greatest leaders of the history. He fought with the apartheid regime with a strong will, saved a lot of black people abused, and changed South Africa. I respect him very much, and believe his achievements will be praised forever."
NBE06876,"When I was a high school student, I studied world history and learned about him so I was very surprised to hear his death. I'm sure that he had strong will because he didn't give up getting rid of racial discrimination in prison and just the will have changed the world. I think his life told us how important the world peace is. I really hope that all the human can live equally, regardless of their race, religion, sex and flesh color. I pray his soul may rest in peace."
NBE06929,"Because of his credits, I think Nelson Mandela is great. He tried to resolve racial discrimination, and he success to decrease it. I respect him very much, and think that we have to do anything to get rid of racial discrimination."
NBE07152,"After 27 years, his concern was not revenge for his mistreatment. It is surprised, 27 years are so long that people ordinarily get angry about the mistreatment. In short, his concern which was making sure the country remind together was strong, so we must not make his will useless."
NBE05676,"I respect him because he had the firm brief and withstood adversity as a representative of black people. I think Nelson Mandela encourage not only South African but also all black people In the world. Actually, the fact Mandela become the President of South Africa was the opportunity that the right of black people was improved."
NBE06277,"There are a lot of discriminations all over the world, and apartheid is only one of them. I think Nelson Mandela is great person in that he is the first president fought against apartheid, but we must make sure there are a lot of problems about racism to solve."
NBE07153,"I agree with your opinion. Nelson Mandela was the great leader. His act helped many people, so we have to take over his will and be great like him."
NBE06718,I think that Nelson Mandela is great person. He embodied with racial equality. We should learn his actions and thinking. I hope the world will be without discrimination.
NBE06168,"Nelson Mandela is one of the most grateful politicians in 20 century. South Africa should keep his dream and appeals to world about prohibition of discrimination. Moreover, They should thanks to Nelson Mandela."
NBE06167,"I think so. I respect Nelson Mandela very much. We should not lose freedom and equal. Then, we should banish racial discrimination."
NBE07329,I really respect Nelson Mandela. I strongly think his action was brave even he was put in jail for a while. He continued to try to make the society right and seems to be afraid of nothing. I believe his achievement will continue to be handed down forever in the world.
NBE07077,What Nelson Mandela have done to us and our society should be highly respected. His brave actions gave us hope. His wise and thoughtful actions showed us the right model of a human being. He will continue to be our respected figure and legend who will also continue to give us influences.
NBE05423,"I think that your opinion is right. Nelson Mandela's great work should be praised, but this is just the trip of an iceberg. We have to try to solve that problems following him."
NBE06089,"Nelson Mandela was a great person. The first time I knew his was during a lesson in junior high school, when my teacher let us watch a movie called ""Invictus"". This movie is about Mandela who became the first black president of South Africa, who tries to put together the country by reconstructing the rugby team. This movie shows the true story of how Mandela tried to put together the country, but the way he did this was fantastic. For example, he hired a white bodyguard besides him to symbolize the society getting better. I was impressed to how great this person was when I watched this movie, so I was really depressed when I first heard the news. I strongly believe that this person is one of the greatest person of human history, so I hope people would always remember him."
NBE05997,"When I read this article I surprised that people who work for politics is desperate. This article says the candidate is stabbed while campaigning for politics. When I asked ""please imagine life-threatening work"", I imagine firefight, police-officer, security, military personnel and so on. But this time candidate is stabbed. My recognition is mistake. There are a lot of politician who killed somebody. For example Lincoln and Kennedy are. They are assassinated by somebody. It is common that they work for opportunity that life of national can be better than then. Lincoln worked hard for democracy and realized. Kennedy worked for the avoidance of Cuban Missile Crisis and save a lot of life not only American but also Cuban. Henrietee Reker worked for huge influx of asylum seekers from Syria to Germany. But she was stabbed. I know if huge asylum seekers come to in Germany, Germany economic; living environment and social security will be bad. But I know some country or somebody should save their life too. I believe her working is should be respect. It is natural and good to present many different thinking in the country. But it's not to be allowed to absolute that thinking appeal in violence. I respect her and it is reasonable to she is elected mayor."
NBE02129,"I didn't know this news and I was surprised. Because I thought North Korea hid all the accidents like commit treasons. I don't know the intention why North Korea released this news, but I think Kim Jong Un try to attract other countries' attention. I worry the action of North Korea."
NBE02282,"I was very surprised at this news. Because Mr. Jang Song-Thaek was killed by the real nephew. In Japan, committing murder in relative is a grave offense. I cannot kill my relative whatever they did."
NBE02753,The execution of Jang Song-Thaek was so suddenly that I couldn't understand what had happened in the North Korean. Moreover its politics has been unclear. Those facts have made me feel fear. The whole world also have got nervous. I hope there will not be terrible happening.
NBE02157,"I'm very afraid of North Korea. If Kim Jong Un hates someone, he (she) will be executed. We can't allow this behavior because of the democracy. Charisma successes the autocracy in smart way for better or worse. However, Kim Jong un is going to predominant by the violence. This nation will not survive much longer."
NBE02496,"The present North Korea government won't be able to steady. Because the government tends to exclude people who have different in thought. The government will be excluded by someone who have different thought. So, forcible governance such this doesn't result in peace. It's not confined North Korea."
NBE01689,"I did not know this news and I was surprised at this. Because I do not quite understand this news, I want to read up on this subject."
NBE02395,"I agree with you. We cannot allow Kim Jong Un's behavior because we are living in a democratic society, unlike despotic society of North Korea. Knowing this news, I just felt the difference of political system between North Korea and Japan. The execution of political leaders without a fair trial. . how scary is that! I sympathize with North Korean people. All I can do for them is to hope that they obtain peaceful living in the near future."
NBE01821,"I think this news has great influence on many countries. We can't know that the reason of execution of Mr. Jang is correct, because North Korea is one of the countries that others can't see the inside of the political circumstances. This accident might have been caused by someone's intention, but the truth can't be known. Not only other countries but also the nation of North Korea don't know clearly policy of that country. It is important that other near countries watch the situation carefully."
NBE02073,"I'm afraid of North Korea will wage war. I can't imagine what do Kim Jong Un want to do. North Korea have atomic bomb and missile, so if Kim will take charge Japan will be attacked. We have to avoid the war. But I don't know what we have to do, because North Korea is so closed country. I want North Korea to accept a proposal of conference."
NBE02076,I think so. The most difficult issue is nobody knows the truth of this incident. We have to pay attention against North Korea's action.
NBE01585,"The execution of the second-most-powerful man has a huge impact on not only stability of North Korea regime yet the situation of its people living in poverty. The article says that Mr. Kim tries to strengthen his power by ""resorting to 'a reign of terror, '"" but I think this kind of internal power struggle will decrease loyalty to Kim dynasty, and weaken the whole country. When a person disagrees with you, killing him is the worst way to solve the problem. It isn't even a solution. Unless Mr. Kim accepts a variety of opinions when running the government, there's no possibility that people in North Korea will live a stable life."
NBE02599,"I agree with you. In my opinion, he disclosed the news because he tries to attract other countries' attention and say that his power is great, because there is rumor that he is respected less than his father and grandfather in North Korea's government. I'm also worried that this performance may be escalated."
NBE02102,"I think this incident shows that the Kim government is losing power to control and govern the country. Kim government is at the eclipse, I think. The practice of this forcible policy means that Kim Jon'Un is hasty to gain power and control the nation but the situation isn't favorable to him . Indeed Jang was the center of the government and the man to contact foreign countries , so I wonder what the loss may cause to the country and the surrounding countries."
NBE01510,"I was shocked when I read this article. Political donation problem of Governor of Tokyo was uncovered last month, and Naoki Inose resigned. But it is no more than the scandal about money. There are many problem which is much more terrible problem than Japan."
NBE02797,"I worry about the future situation in North Korea very much. Because Jang Song-Thaek who was executed suddenly was handling nuclear disarmament and economic reform, and Kim Jong Un is now rejecting an international perspective, this incident may cause a bad influence on Japan. The relation between North Korea and our country is very crucial to peace in East Asia. Therefore, I want the authorities act carefully."
NBE02517,"I was so surprised to hear the news. This execution of Jang Song-Thaek will affect the stability and social cohesion of North Korea. We don't know what North Korea will happen in future. In Japan, this circumstance is not safety because North Korea is next to Japan and any other accidents in North Korea have some connection with Japan. This accident did not received front-page coverage, and so I think that Japan news medium should report the more Asia situation. Japanese people have to become sensitized to the situation in Asia, especially Korea, North Korea and China."
NBE01944,"I agree with your opinion. The North Korean diplomatic central figure was him so far. After he was dead, we were not able to expect an action of North Korea. Japan should not overlook their trifling action."
NBE01385,"Jang Song would have been determined to be a hindrance for the current power. I do not know whether he thought that the ""steal the regime"", but because he had a track record and experience, it would have been regarded as dangerous elements. Anyway, the situation to decide things in power is not desirable. In addition, information manipulation is horrible, too. I wonder people of North Korea believe the reason for his downfall. I feel this news represents the unstable political situation. North Korea should be stable in good condition. However, it seems difficult in the current regime."
NBE01386,"I did not have an idea like you until I read this comment, but I agree with your opinion. I think indeed, usually, such a fact should be hidden, too. If not research capacity of neighboring countries was adept, I think what you think is a very fact. And, I worry the action of North Korea , too."
NBE01654,"I don't know whether Jang Song-Thaek was really bad person or not, because the central government of North Korea is corrupt. I think that not only Jang Song-Thaek but also other mandarin commit corruption. I guess Jang Song-Thaek was punished in order to suppress North Korea's bad reputation."
NBE01657,"I do not know about this news and North Korea in detail either, however we should know them well for Japanese national interest. North Korea is the neighboring country for Japan and very dangerous."
NBE01658,"I agree with you. The biggest problem is that nobody know the inside of the its political circumstances. Also its central government have so many political scandal. I guess this accident is also caused by someones intention same as you. North Korea locates very close to Japan, so we have to pay attention to the North Korea's trend."
NBE02675,"Now I am very fearful of North Korea. I cannot imagine the feeling of killing one of the nation's leaders. We don't know whether Jang song Thaek actually made a plan of terrorism or he was corrupt in the politics. However, even if he was vicious, why did they make such an easy decision to execute him? To banish him out of the political circle was enough. A lot of countries in the world will suffer a serious loss due to his death because many of those countries maintained the relationship with North Korea by contacting with Jang song Thaek."
NBE01328,The execution of the second-most-powerful man has a huge impact on stability of North Korea regime. We don't know what North Korea will happen in future. The biggest problem is that nobody know the inside of the its political circumstances. We should take care of their acts.
NBE02699,"Whether he committed to trait or not , that something will happen in South Korea may be no doubt. South Korea is nearby Japan , so we must pay attention to its movement of future."
NBE01559,"I agree with your opinion. Kim Jong Un's actions are difficult to anticipate. So we have to cooperate with other countries such as America and South Korea. And it is also important to restrain the nation which have the possibility of giving help to keep the non-democratic political system. If this could be happen, North Korea will have no choice but to accept a proposal of conference."
NBE02601,"He wants to say that his power is great, because there is rumor around the world that he is respected less than his father and grandfather in North Korea's government. I'm also worried that this performance may be escalated."
NBE02776,"I did not know this news and I was surprised at it. I reconfirm that North Korea is so dangerous. If the same thing happened in Japan, I can not live comfortably."
NBE02678,"Maybe I remember this news was on the front page and Japan news media broadcast it a lot. I think Japanese media covers enough news in other Asian countries which is related to Japan politics, economy, environment and so on. If you want to get more information about adjacent countries, you should be more willing to get them. You can find them anywhere in the Internet."
NBE02626,"This news shows that Kim Jong-Un tries to make North Korea more despotic. Although, even up to now, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il sometimes executed some politicians for their treasonable acts, they never punished their relatives because North Korean was a Confucian country. However, Kim Jong-Un killed Jang Song-Thaek, his uncle-in-law, and furthermore, abused him by calling him ""a brutal ambitious traitor"" and ""lesser than dogs"". The detailed reasons why he was punished is not clear, but the certain fact that this news shows is that North Korea is becoming a dangerous despotic country and increasing military strength."
NBE02231,Can we interfere other nation's domestic politics when it is clear that its leader cannot govern the country properly? I think it is one of the discussion-provoking points of international law and politics.
NBE02232,Either did I understand what actually happened in North Korea and why. It's really confusing.
NBE01562,"North Korea is not democratic country, so it is useless to criticize the country unless its political system changes. However, achieving this is very difficult. So democratic countries should cooperate and do economic sanctions. If these countries do that, North Korea may collapse or follow our direction and change political system."
NBE01664,"I do not think Jang Song-Thaek was killed by his nephew. The central government of North Korea have so many corruptions. Jang Song-Thaek possessed powerful authority, so I guess this accident is also caused by someones intention not by Kim Jong Un."
NBE02541,"I was surprised to hear this news, because Kim Jong Un killed his own uncle. This story is like in the age of wars. In Japan, a long time ago, there were struggle for power among the family. I knew again how outdated North Korea is!!"
NBE01877,"I was very surprised at this news. I really think North Korea is dangerous because if Jang Song-Thaek is a really bad person, I will never kill blood relative person. And I feel that there is a lot of person who does an injustice in North Korea. I want to why."
NBE02350,"I agree with your idea, this is because I think the government tends to exclude people who have different in thought too. I think the North Korea government is hard dictatorship. I think it is very serious problem and we need to think more seriously."
NBE01799,"I didn't know this news in detail. However, when I researched about this news in the other day, I was very surprised. I think that it is a bad thing which he kills key person in government. I hope North Korea become peace country."
NBE02283,I agree with you. I am afraid of North Korea. I cannot forget the news that All of North Korean were crying when Kim Jong iI died. I don't want to visit that country.
NBE02706,"I disagree with you. South Korea is the country dominated by the dictator. This kind of country , kill one's relative is usual I think."
NBE02729,I think this news shows that the government can't control and govern their country. However we cannot predict that what influence to the world the current condition of this country make. I hope a new war will not happen.
NBE01253,I disagree with you. I think Mr. Jang Song-Thaek was not killed by the real nephew. But I have no reason.
NBE02650,Kim Jong Un killed his uncle Jang Song-Thaek. That's so terrible. He killed his relative so easily. I cannot believe this. So sad. This news made me rethink of NK.
NBE02325,"Kim Jong-Un was scared that many politicians of the North Korea highly trusted Chang Song-Thaek. Now he was executed, it is said that the dictatorship of Kim will get much bigger. The nation around the North Korea should try to monitor and put pressure on the country."
NBE01715,"It's horrible to read this news. we can't see inside the country, but other countries try to solve this problem because if people in the country try, there will be many people to be killed. I hope that some people in the world will try after knowing the situation through this news article."
NBE02030,The news shocked me! And I don't know North Korean government will want to do. I think North Korea is a secret and hidden country. So I want to know the country more. The country is on my mind. I will want to check their actions from now on.
NBE02205,"Now, I know this news for the first time. I'm worried about North Korea. There're some dangerous remark."
NBE02575,I disagree with you. North Korea is not democracy. So this country is not in use our common sense. It is very sad thing but it is the fact.
NBE01435,"After I read this news, I think there is possibility that Kim John Un do something alike this incident. I don't know the real intention why Kim Jong Un killed his nephew, but I think he wanted to attract other countries' attention. I hope he won't do some terrible things for this purpose."
NBE01358,"I can't understand why he can kill his uncle by himself. Probably, his intention is maintaining his power. If so, the action is insane or lunatic. In fact, the action is must be a failure. The North Korea lost confidence in China. Anyway, we must pay attention to The North Korea."
NBE02542,"I agree with you. I think unless North Korea is opened, there is no knowing what they will do next. I am afraid that they stand alone from the world."
NBE01762,"I think it is a horrible news. I heard that hundreds of people who have connection with Mr. Jang was also going to be executed. It is of course unbelievable to hear this kind of news now in 21 century, but actually most of us cannot see the things without the perspective of Western. So if we say something against the systems of North Korea, we don't and shouldn't have any influence on them."
NBE02207,"I at first know this news by the internet. I can't believe this news. Everyone may be a traitor in the North Korea. In Japan, this news was seldom reported by TV. I think people should know this news more."
NBE01895,"I was very shocked by this news and I also very interested in this kind of information. Considered by the fact that he often meet the Japanese governor instead of Kim, Mr. Jang was sure to be vital character for attacking the some problems of Japan-North Korea relationship."
NBE01436,"When I heard this news, I was little shocked because Kim John Un killed his uncle . I don't know the real intention of him, but I guess he did this because he wanted to attract other countries' attention. There are possibility that North Korea do something dangerous to attract other countries attention, so we should continue to monitor situation carefully."
NBE02549,"I was very shocked to hear this news. Kim John Un killed his uncle. It cannot be happened in democratic nation. I think unless North Korea is opened, there is no knowing what they will do next. I am afraid that they stand alone from the world."
NBE02353,"I was very shocked about this news. This is because I also afraid about future of North Korea's government. If Kim John Un think he want to change or improve the country, he need to change and answer the attention from foreign country. North Korea is neighbor country for Japan so that Japanese government should attract North Korea carefully."
NBE01301,"I think the government of North Korea is more fragile than China. The first leader of the North Korea won the people's popularity and was charismatic. The second leader succeeded the deification of himself and the nuclear experiment. However, the third leader, yet obtained big achievement like his father and the grandfather. Unlike the former leaders, he cannot rule the country by himself. I think the destruction of the Kim regime is near."
NBE01606,"First, I couldn't understand what happened in North Korea. Because the execution of Jang Song-Thaek was so suddenly. From old days, their politics has been unclear. Everyone wishes that this country soon becomes peaceful."
NBE01607,"Me too. Because the information is very few, we could not understand about that country correctly."
NBE02979,"Captains have the obligation to help their passengers of their ferry and failing to meet their obligation is the thing which is not accepted. So the thing that the captain of South Korean ferry did is not accepted and he deprived the passengers of South Korean ferry of their lives. The captain and the company must apologize to the passengers and his family, and must explain how the accident happens exactly."
NBE02957,"This accident is very bad news. Above all, I feel heat that the captain left passengers in the ship and thought that he saved his own bacon. Certainly, many people would want to be saved at the very beginning if they are in his position. But he accountable to have fall into that circumstance which he had failed steering and the vessel sank, so he was supposed to help passengers preferentially even if he become the last person who board the ship. I'd like to have him become acutely conscious of the captain."
NBE02984,This is one of the most terrible accident that I have ever heard. I hope more people will be rescued. We should never repeat such a tragedy.
NBE03004,"I think this is an entirely man-made disaster and this disaster happened because of two reasons. First, the captain lacked a sense of responsibility. I watched the news which says a young conductor died because she had tried to help the ship's passengers instead of the captain who had run away from the wreck. Second, emergency measure wasn't prevailed among the ship's conductors. If the conductors had told the passengers not to stay inside but to run away, more lives was saved. Therefore, I think conductors of transportation need to improve their consciousness of responsibility, because they carry human's lives."
NBE03008,"Yesterday, I watched the news about this accident and listen to the unbelievable comment which the captain said. He said that he hurt his hips and he was said ""Get out of the vessel! Hurry up!"" , so he just do as he was said. Moreover, he concealed that he is the captain when he was rescued. I can't believe it! After deserting his passengers, he acted as if he knew nothing about it. And people's dissatisfaction about the government is heightening more and more. I think that the government can't deal with this disaster properly, too. They neglect a training of talented people about duties of protection against disaster and safety. They have to strengthen it immediately. Now, the number of the dead reached 150 and 152 are still missing. I hope that a rescue operation is making fast progress."
NBE03001,"I was surprised to hear this news. It may be unavoidable to have caused the accident. But It is very bad that the captain who should have responsibility escaped. According to news, the captain said, ""This ship is safer than any ship. "" Such a reason, It is natural that a captain is blamed. I think those who are doing work which protects people's life should become the most careful. I hope such an occurrence never happens."
NBE02977,"When I first heard this news, I felt it was similar to ""Titanic. "" As I knew the details about this disaster, it should be blamed that the captain's sense if responsibility was completely lacked and the Sewol itself was converted in strange way. Also there was no consciousness of safety I think."
NBE02999,"Recently, I have heard about this sad news many times on TV, and every time I hear about it, it really made me sad. Among this news, there is something that is bothering me. Korean government refuse Japanese government's help. I know that between Japan and Korea, we are facing a difficult politics problem. However, I think we should help each other under such terrible condition, and that leads better relationship. I hope that many people who are still missing will be rescued, and such a tragedy will never happen again!"
NBE03005,"Recently, I often watch the grieving familys who are crying and shouting on the news. Action the captain took is absolutely unpardonable. It goes without saying. I think measures of South Korean government is bad. They refused support of Japan or America. I don't understand why they didn't accept it. There is no time because the most necessary thing now is to rescue the passengers. I fear search become more serious."
NBE03007,"I think this is one of the most tragic disaster. Many of victims are not found now. It make me sad. I'm afraid that this deplorable disaster was forgotten by media and people. I pray that any disaster like this never happen again. So I want not to forgot. Moreover, media all over the world should tell people this accident entirely. This is a very very tragic disaster, but this is a man-made disaster which many people concerned indirectly. The best thing we should do is find the source of trouble."
NBE02994,"I watched the news that the disaster like this happened in Japan before. Although in that case there were only 28 passengers in the ship, there were no victims. In Japan's case, the captain of the ship let passengers go on board a helicopter and get on a lifeboat on his own lastly. It is the very best and proper way to be a captain. Korea's captains should follow that Japanese captain and try never to cause a tragic disaster like this time's."
NBE02953,"This article made me really sad and I think we have to learn something very important from this. First, we should consider the responsibility of captain. It is true that everyone wants to survive, however, I believe that humanity to others is the most important for us. Therefore, the captain's action in this case is not good. Second, we should consider about what ""safety"" is like. I hear that in Korea, the standard of safety is lower than Japan. For example, it is normal that people don't wear seatbelt in their cars. It is acceptable that there are some differences between the countries, but I think we need to learn from another country. In this case, if Korean standard of safety had been higher, this terrible accident might not have happened. Therefore, I think Korean government have to change and look over rules again soon."
NBE02978,"At first, I was surprised and even felt angry at the captain's irresponsibility. But now, I think that, in a way, It cannot be helped. Even though he had the duty to rescue all passengers, it may require so much of courage as one cannot gather. Of course, the act that he did is unacceptable. However, it should be taken into consideration that, like many people, he is a man who is weak and afraid of death. Anyway, I can't do nothing but hope that such a disaster will never happen and the captain will be judged and sentenced legally."
NBE02998,"South Korean government and the company managing the Sewol must have prevented this accident. If there had been strict rules about security, and if the company had done a fire drill, this accident was not so serious as it is. This accident has caused widespread panic in South Korea and other countries. Moreover, the company has lost prestige. I think I won't ride ships possessed by this company. All I can do for victims is praying for them and thinking deeply about preventing recurrence of this accident. I feel irritated that I can do almost nothing for victims. Nevertheless, I hope there are survivors in the ship."
NBE02974,"If my family or friends met with a accident like this news, I would get angry for a captain and grieve for them. And if I were the grieving families, I could not forgive the captain's action and existence. It is regrettable that the accident occurred. I think of victims and their family and friends, I'm very sorry about it. Although the captain's action was certainly criticized, I think taking place of his condition, he would also been terrified and want to live. I understand his feeling about that, but I would like to tell him, ""you must understand that all passengers had the same feeling of you. They put their life in your hand, and how many people hope do your best for them and be saved. ""All captains of vessels and pilots of airplanes think the news, and should image the worst case. And they must think If worst comes to worst, what they should do or can do. They must not forget a sense of responsibility about having passenger's lifes. I hope such a accident never happen again."
NBE02986,"What will you do if a captain of your ferry escaped without telling the situation?Almost all of the people will do nothing under the situation. The captain of South Korean ferry took a mistake which made us sad. His lack of responsibility for saving his passengers aroused my anger. If it was true that he escaped earlier than anyone else, I could not believe this action. It is natural for a captain to saving the lives of people to the last. This accident had us to be anxiety of going by ship. I often use a ship and an airplane when I take a trip. If my family or friends were involved in such a accident, I would get angry for a captain of the ferry. This is two times that big accidents which makes us sad. I wish these accidents which killed many people never happen forever. It is because that a ship and an airplane is surely need to take a trip."
NBE02972,"The captain's act is not acceptable. However I can understand his feelings. If I had been in his position, I would have left passengers like him. Putting passenger's lives before his own life is very courageous and difficult, but since he was a captain, he had a responsibility to do that. I learned I can't be a captain from this news."
NBE02968,"Firstly , I offer condolences on the victims of the accident. Many people who are as young as me are still missing. I wish they will be discovered. It is unbelievable to me that captain escaped from the ferry. Captains of ships are responsible for them. So they have to lead the passengers to escape. But he raced to get away without a thought for anyone else. I want to ride the ferry which is capsized by reliable person. I hope for captain's sense of responsibility."
NBE02996,"I think this is one of most tragic disaster. A lot of people have not rescued yet. when I think about feelings of the bereaved, it feels me hurt and makes me sad. The problem is a captain responsibility and sloppy administration. I think we should be never happen like this accident anymore."
NBE02944,"When I got the whole story of this accident, I felt sad and infuriated. This is not just an accident but a tragedy caused by slipshod management system of company operating the ferry. If a junior officer had not taken helm, this accident would not have happened. If the captain of the ferry had evacuated passengers, it would not have brought many deaths. However, Nothing comes out of just criticizing. They should take measures to review their crisis management system as soon as possible."
NBE02973,"This news made me sad, since many people including high school students , who are coeval with me, died. Furthermore the most having made me sad is that this accident was a man-made disaster. The captain escaped more foremost than anyone else and alerted people on board no precautions against the ship careening. If crews had promoted more awareness and evacuated the passengers with feeling of responsibility, more people could have last out. Through this accident, we learned many lessons. As one of the lessons, many companies should give their employees training on safety as necessary harder than before. By enforcing safety standards, I hope that accidents by human mistake will have never occurred."
NBE02981,"Reading this article, my first impression to the captain of the vessel was very bad. Of course , it is true that every man is always afraid of his death but as the captain, he was responsible for all the passengers. So, to him, it should have been the last thing to leave the vessel. From the bottom of my heart, I hope the captain and his crew will be sentenced strictly."
NBE02955,"The captain of the South Korean ferry should not be allowed to practice as a detective. Captains have a duty to save passengers. However, this captain put priority on himself. I think everyone should take pride in and responsibility for theirs work. Also, there is another problem. The problem is the speed of investigation. When it comes to the saving of a life, the speed is the most important. Of course, South Korea is an advanced country, on the other hand, there is no end of troubles. From this point of view, South Korea is condemned. Then, I think Japan not only criticize South Korea but regard South Korea as a country from whose bad example one can learn."
NBE02942,"This is very sad news. I think we must learn from this disaster. Actually, I didn't even know how to escape from wreck. I took it for granted that ship is never sinking. If that happens again, I dive in the ocean before a ship capsizing. And, all drivers should raise the security awareness of ship. I want to avoid repeating the same mistakes."
NBE02947,I can't understand why the captain and his crew jumped into a rescue boat and remind his passengers in the ferry. They should have given instruction to his passengers could move to a safer area. The captain have to take a serious view of passengers' life. Also Korean government neglected countermeasures. I think this disaster could keep off if there were proper countermeasures. I hope such disaster never happen in the future.
NBE02965,"This news is really sad. 187 people were killed in the accident, and 115 people are still missing. I ached at the sad news. I felt angry about the captain's action. He was not at the helm of the vessel when it capsized, and jumped into a rescue boat before passengers. These are the action that a captain must not do. If he had acted responsibly as a captain, more people might have escaped death. We must not occur an accident like this again. I pray for the safety of missing people."
NBE02988,"I felt sad when I read this news. A lot of people passed away and their family got angry so much about the captain who jumped into a rescue boat though there were many passengers in the ship. I also think he was irresponsible. In my opinion, the captain of the ship should not leave it until all the passengers are rescued. If he don't make the promise, we cannot be relieved when we take a ship."
NBE02991,"This news made me shocked and sad, because so many high school students who were as young as me were killed by this accident. If only the captain had attempted to rescue them. . . When I attended a class of Korean language few days ago, I ask teacher who is from Korea opinion concerning this accident. She said""This accident is not only excruciating but also too shameful as Korean to refer to anymore. Also, if you feel uncomfortable when you see pictures of screaming bereaved , I want you to understand their pain. "" I think this accident involved the problem about responsibilities of leaders in every organization."
NBE02970,"When I read the article, I felt great angry for the captain. That's because he gave up to rescue his passengers and deserted them in order to survive himself alone. Perhaps, hundreds were still in the water at that time, wanting to be rescued. If the captain has had normal character and advised the passengers to evacuate properly, many of innocent lives wouldn't die. In addition, according the article, almost victims are high school students. All of them had hopeful future, but now have grieving families. Therefore, it is no exaggeration that the captain's stupid act deprived students of their infinite potential. Sincerely, I hope such a terrible accident never happens."
NBE02983,"When I heard this news, I was so sad. First, many people were killed in this accident. Especially it was the news that was very sad for me that a high school student was in an accident during a school excursion. It is a very disappointing thing that a young person dies. Second, the captain's action made us get angry. It was an action without a sense of responsibility. I think that I want the crew of the ship to compensate for a crime well. This news made us consider many point. I hope that such a thing never happens."
NBE02963,"I cannot understand why the captain jumped into a rescue boat without helping passengers. I think he wanted to be alive when the accident happened. If I face it, I would think so. However, he was the captain of the ferry which carried hundreds of people, so he had a responsibility to save their lives, but he neglected it. It is only natural that he is condemned. We should convey such a tragic accident to coming generation in order that we never forget it and it never happen."
NBE02950,"I think this accident may be an example of Korean's problems. It's because this accident is caused by persons, for example, the captain of this ferry didn't operate the ferry. In fact, the most problem is Korean's society!! when the ferry was sinking, a student in the ferry called Republic of Korea Coast Guard(RKCG) to help people in the ferry. But, RKCG couldn't distinguish the call from a call from the captain. This example shows Korean's flaw most, that is, Korean government cannot respond to an issue in case of emergency."
NBE02949,"I think that the captain should have dealt with this accident as a captain. He should have been responsible for passengers' lives . I regard a lot of criticism as quite natural. This accident took a heavy toll of human lives. If the crew had listened to the voices of conscience, this accident could have been avoided. We need to learn from and act on the lessons of this accident. We have to conduct an investigation in order to know this background. We need to uncover the reason why the crew neglected their duties."
NBE02961,"This news made me sad. That many of the hundreds passengers were high school students is deplorable. In addition, I feel great sorrow in that many passengers still have been in the sea. I hope that people still missing will be found and bodies will return to their family. But, above all, I got angry with the captain who had jumped into a rescue boat leaving his passengers in the wreck. If he had given accurate information and instruction to them, more people would have been saved."
NBE02954,"I can't help sympathizing with grieving families when I heard this news. I think the captain's crime was too cruel to be forgiven. Also, I found very interesting thing in this article. If this accident happened in Japan, we would criticize not only a captain, but also a company which employs him. It is because we think the company has a responsibility to train employees. I hope more victims would be saved from the ferry."
NBE02990,"This news made me think a lot of things, the responsibility for work, the feelings of the bereaved, the importance of our life etc. In terms of the bereaved, of course I can understand the criticism for the captain. But I also think every life is equally important. The captain also had his family and maybe had the reason why he have to live. If the captain had been dead when the accident had occurred, perhaps he would be a hero now, but isn't it just our ideal? If you were the captain at the situation, can you choice the death while you have a lot of important things? I felt it is so difficult to think of the balance between the responsibility for work and life equality."
NBE02952,"The problem of this article is responsibility of the captain, but I think that the company's education is more important. It is true that the South Korean ferry captain did an irreparable thing, however, it is also the responsibility of company. Company have to employ people with sense of strong responsibility and educate strictly. The problem of the Malaysian Airlines flight 370 occurred because of management of company wasn't strict. So I think company have to have strong responsibility."
NBE03002,"I sympathized with victim's family, and also felt angry to Lee Joon-Seok, his crew and people who loaded too much. I think that if Lee steered ship and cargos were loaded too much, the Sewol didn't sink. So Korean government should check supervision system of ship."
NBE02946,"First, When I herd this news, it caused me much pain. I think all of the captains must be responsible for rider's life, but the captain didn't carry out in the responsible manner. This accident may be significant to consider about responsibilities which professional seamen have. Not limited to this, other professionals like sailors and pilots (Malaysian Airlines flight 370 mystery too) have to be conscious of impotence of life."
NBE02992,I was shocked about this news. I cannot understand why captain jumped into the sea without helping passengers still in the ship. Becoming a captain means he has a high position in the ship and also has all responsibilities of the ship and lives of all passengers who use the ship. I think there is more important things than earning money and fame.
NBE02989,I feel sad to hear this news. I think a lot of people can't understand this accident in detail. So I hope Korean government expose information for this news as soon as possible.
NBE02951,"I was shocked at this news, for most of the people who were killed in this accident were high school students. The captain of the ferry should have remained there and given directions to passengers. We must understand what is a problem of this accident and try hard not to make such mistakes again."
NBE02962,"I think that it is very sad story. If I were a student who take the ship, I would regret choosing the ship, and if I were the bereaved family, I would regret seeing my son or daughter off. This is not just an affair of other people, and all the countries of the world should be care of their countries safety for a nation."
NBE03009,This is one of the most tragic disaster that I have ever heard. It is a very unfortunate accident. There is a strong possibility of the case that I will be involved in such a miserable accident. So I think I must spend meaningful days in order not to have any regrets.
NBE02975,"To hear that news, I was very surprised and sad. This is because the captain of that ferry who should have been left in the ferry jumped into a rescue boat early and abandoned many passengers and his crew . If he had remained, a lot of people would have been saved . Now, all I can do is hope that missing people will be saved. Moreover, the captain must explain this accident and do what is good for the bereaved families."
NBE02980,"the captain had to have one choice in two choices, to save himself or to save his passengers, in this case. Of course, he has to save his passengers as the captain of this ferry. But if you are the captain then, what do you do? Do you blame him the same again? I guess he imagined the severe life after going back to Korea. But he thought to live as a criminal is better than to die. Not only us but also himself had the pretty sad. I hope to rescue the left passengers as soon as possible."
NBE02958,"Nowadays, we see a lot of newses like this. I'm afraid of the fact that the public transportation is not actually safe unless we believe so. In this case, I think the behavior of the captain cannot be allowed, but I also think we all would have done in his way if we had been him. The public transportations should take enough care about their safety and we always have to prepare for the accident so that we can react immediately."
NBE03003,"At first, I got angry at what this captain did and feel sorry that many passengers are still missing;( However, I realize that I can't know what happened at the moment because I know the details about the accident only by mass media. I suppose we mustn't accept whatever we read in the newspapers and on the Internet without thinking by ourselves."
NBE03000,"I am agreement at your opinion. I also feel anger for the persons involved in this incident. However, when there were few cargoes, didn't the incident occur? It may also be a fact that surely there are many cargoes and operation of a ship has become inconvenient. But, I think that the first problem is a captain's action. So, I think that the incident had occurred even if there were few cargoes."
NBE02969,"I think so. Those who have a responsibility has to consider others. The captain didn't think about the passengers. They believe the crews, but they betray them. I forgive what they did."
NBE02995,I think so too. The captain must be subject to punishment. And I think the impact of mass media is large. I pray they rest in peace.
NBE02985,"I have a same feeling about this news. I also want a matter due to the luck of captain's responsibility does not happened again. I think the captain of his passengers should save their lives. Otherwise, we will not use public transportation from now. Therefore, I want people not to forget a matter like this."
NBE02993,"I completely agree to your opinion. Actually, I thought that the news was similar to the Titanic, but the difference between them is ""season"" the accident occurred. In Korean case, if the passengers had jumped into the sea, they would be alive. The captain should have more responsibility all the more because people who can be rescued died."
NBE02976,"I think it's exactly as you say. The captain and crews of Sewol, Republic of Korea Coast Guard and the Korean Government was irresponsible and very loose. So the more they had sense of responsibility, the less people died of the Sewol tragedy, I think. And I think too that Korea should retrain the responsibility and consciousness of government employees and the crews."
NBE02982,"I think that I cannot necessarily blame only a captain. It is a very difficult thing to make a calm decision at the point of death. However, I cannot forgive a captain. It is the problem that is not easy to treat."
NBE02945,I always watch TV that The president of South Korea pursuits the issue. But is it top priority for her?I don't think so. She should put stress the right of life of people. Why did she send the limited number of a rescue party?She thinks lightly of lives. Japanese navy and Air Force can have gone to save many people. Because Japanese Forces is in Sasebo near Korea. And she should have asked Japan to do so. Maybe her pride prevents from asking.
NBE02964,"I think so. A captain of ferry has a task which is saving passengers' lives. If an accident happens, he must do this and prioritize saving passengers. He who jumped into a rescue boat without saving is far from being a captain. I find that I am not cut out to be a captain, too."
NBE02997,"I agree with you. But, it is also dangerous to try diving in the ocean before a ship capsizing. There are as many dangerous things in the ocean as in a sinking ship. So, all we can do to prevent such cruel accident from occurring again is to improve all drivers security awareness and ethics."
NBE02943,I felt the same thing. The worst was captain who didn't evacuate passengers. But only blaming him is good for nothing anymore. I guess they should review their safe control.
NBE03006,"I agree with Your comment. -- ""If there had been strict rules about security, and if the company had done a fire drill, this accident was not so It approves of the opinion serious as it is. "" I think that the crew lacked the simulation and knowledge of the troubleshooting. The captain said later, ""It was considered When the accident, I could not think anything excepting how to I will be able to live. "" It is because the captain was not able to assume such a miserable accident. Probably, his head has filled then. Nobody should not forget that there is a danger of the accident. For that purpose, a detailed text book and training of fire drill are required."
NBE02960,I was surprised to hear this news. This accident is one of the most terrible accident. But It is very bad that the captain who should have responsibility escaped. I think that captain should have responsibility to the passenger's lives and the government should impose a severe punishment on the captain.
NBE02971,"When I read this article, the ferry's captain is cruel man because he acted as murder. captain should be bold and kind, but he is a chicken. In this case, I think the behavior of the captain cannot be allowed, but I also think we all would have done in his way if we had been him."
NBE02967,"When I read this article, I was so sad and hope that the ferry's captain change himself. He must be punished and we should do many many things by the such thing happen next time. For example, we should restrict captain's license."
NBE02948,"I strongly agree with you. You said that they should take measures to review their crisis management system as soon as possible. It is true that we should not forget this tragedy. However, all we have to do is make a new crisis management system in order not to occur such a tragedy repeatedly. They need a personnel cut. To do so, workers who was responsible for this accident should be punished and fired. Furthermore, we make them change an atmosphere in this company."
NBE02966,I think so. Of course I cannot understand why the captain jumped into a rescue boat without helping passengers. He should have helped hundreds of people instead of himself.
NBE02959,This is true that the captain responsible to this accident. But a people should think seriously why this accident happened.
NBE02956,"When I read this news , I felt so sad because many people were killed by this tragedy . Also , I got angry with the captain of this ferry . It is crazy thing to escape from the ferry when the accident happened ."
NBE02941,"This is very sad news. Certainly, the captain is to be held responsible by the bereaved family. But, I think we must learn from this disaster. Actually, I didn't even know how to escape from wreck. I took it for granted that ship is never sinking. If that happens again, I dive in the ocean before a ship capsizing. And, all drivers should raise the security awareness of ship. I want to avoid repeating the same mistakes."
NBE02987,"Don't you want get on the ferry of the captain who has no responsibility for our lives? If we were passengers of the ferry, we would choose to save our own lives. However, the action of a captain is most important problem in the accident. Therefore, if we were the captains of the ferry, what we would do? If I were the captain, I would choose to save passenger's life first."
NBE06140,I was very shocked to hear this news. I knew an irresponsible person like him for the first time. I am very regrettable that many men and women of the age that is about the same as me died because of him. I think that person in charge must have a serious sense of responsibility by all means. And we must not forget this affair.
NBE07112,"When I knew this news, I am high school student. Many Korean high school students were died by this accident. So I am shocked. I think captain should have helped to passenger. But he was escaped from Sewol. I was disappointed of it."
NBE06238,"I can't believe that the captain of the ferry boat escaped after the tragedy. Needless to say, the duty of the ship's crew is to save passengers from the accident. Recently, such accidents as crew caused are increasing both on the sea and in the air. I hope that crew should accomplish their duty properly."
NBE06996,"We must have second thought about responsibility of captains who control vehicle which people ride on. If captains will happen accident , passengers may be injured or die as this accident. Therefore captains must accept heavy responsibility for passengers lives and we must carefully select responsible captains."
NBE06845,"I think the captain must be punished with appropriate penalty. Of course, it is not difficult to imagine his fear of death and why he wanted to run away faster but he is the captain, he kept thousands of people's life and it means he had to think and make action to save passengers life first of all. If he did so, I think we could save more people. I want to him to regret throwing his responsible and rehabilitate himself. I wish we never cause these case"
NBE06538,"I think, if the captain had given the passengers appreciate directions, more passengers might have survived. This accident was caused by some human errors. So, the company which administered the ferry and the South Korean government should respond to the victims and the bereaved sincerely."
NBE06753,I was so shocked when I heard this news. I think what the ferry's captain did is the cruel thing and what should not be allowed. I feel sorry for many people who was passed away and still missing passengers. I want to know the truth and the details of this accident.
NBE07399,"The captain lacked responsibility which he shouldered about 500 lives. Every crew should understand how to escape from the vessel when accidents occur. Last month, German airplane crashed. I hope such an accident will never happen. I think an education for pilots change more strictly."
NBE07242,"I think we must learn from this disaster. If people do only criticism this case is wasted, so I think we should avoid repeating the same mistakes. For example, drivers raise the security awareness of ship."
NBE05645,"I read this news , then it is like a ""Titanic"". Lee flew earlier, so Lee was no consciousness of safety. I felt anger for this captain. I think that we should make more stricter about the ship's law. I think of students regrettably. Lee was take more responsibility."
NBE05644,"I heard this news, this accident is the most terrible thing in recent ships accident. It is like Titanic. I think that I was able to save more people. A lot of children got into this ship. In other words this accident would take the future of many children."
NBE06720,I was shocked when I heard this news. This is not accidental but man-made disaster. The persons concerned of the ship downplayed safety. I think we mustn't cause similar this accident.
NBE05677,"I think if captain had made a correct judgment and take direction, much more people's life might have been saved. it can be said that The lack of this captain's responsibility cause this terrible disaster."
NBE06844,I think so too. Recently there are many accident of vehicle and crew throw away their duties. It is very sad story and I want to do their best to save passengers. It is very important for the society.
NBE07243,"This is very sad news. I think we must learn from this disaster. Actually, I didn't even know how to escape from wreck. I took it for granted that ship is never sinking. If that happens again, I dive in the ocean before a ship capsizing. And all drivers should raise the security awareness of ship. I want to avoid repeating the same mistakes."
NBE07241,"I agree with his opinions, Because if people do only criticism, this case is wasted, so I think we should make use of this case next."
NBE05440,This is very bad news. I believed the captain of the ferry made the life of passenger importance. The captain should help them. A mental examination of a license should be done more severely.
NBE05197,"I think that it is very sad story. Japan had a similar air accident, Japanese air plane No, 123 fallen down on the Osutaka mount. We have to remember those terrible accidents and we had better not make same mistakes again."
NBE05491,"I think so, too. He deserves to be punished. How terrible the captain is. I doubt his responsibility."
NBE03046,"I think it is really hard to understand the consciousness of religion of other cultures. It is so sensitive and complex problem. So if we go to foreign country , we have to be careful to religion, manners and customs of that country. And we must respect other cultures, of course."
NBE03062,"Religion and culture are very important things. We often visit other countries or areas without thinking their religion, culture and believes. However this news showed it is essential to know their religions, cultures and believes. As our world have been globalized, we meet more and more people who have other religions, believes and cultures. I think we are needed to think more seriously about other persons religion, believes and cultures to respect their dignities."
NBE03021,"This article really surprised me because I never heard this kind of news before. It is true that religion is very important especially for people in Sri Lanka , however , I think this kind of arrest is not good idea. That is because I think Ms Coleman didn't mean hurting others religious feeling as she said, so I feel sorry for her. Also, at the same time, it is the most important for us to do actions which no one doesn't think insults to religions. There may be a lot of people who don't have enough knowledge of religions in the world, including me, so we should learn more about that. To realize this , I think it is a good idea for us to get knowledge at school when we are students, for example. Then, we will need the government's help to improve such movement."
NBE03025,"When I read this article, I understood that each country has each taboo especially referring to religion and we should not model things which is worshipped hastily like tattoo and act rashly for a cult object. It is a matter of course that devotees get angry with such action of foreigners. Also, as the proverb says, ""When in Rome, do as the Romans do, "" when we go abroad, we need to know about taboos of the region beforehand not to behave in against manners and customs of the country."
NBE03073,"I realized again the importance of mutual understanding. Japanese people is indifferent about religion, because people who have particular religion is minority in Japan, but religion is concerned with life to believers and often religion cause the battle. So I think if I trip or contact to intercultural people, we should be careful for our behavior . especially, we must be sensitive in shrine, church, temple and etc. . . in all over the world ."
NBE03070,"I think this article alarmed that we should not force others to apply our standard of religion. There are many people in the world, so ways of thinking and faithing vary, so like Naomi Coleman, people shouldn't have been arrested for her way of faithing. However, we should respect other people's thought and faith and keep minimum manner. Thus, we should make manner's border clear in order to get along with other culture."
NBE03075,"I don't believe a specific religion fervently and probably, most of Japanese people don't, too. Therefore I didn't understand why the police spokesman, taxi drivers, the plain-clothes police officer and so on were very angry against Naomi Coleman's tattoo and I think the treating she accepted is overdoing when I read this news for the first time. However my opinion was changed. She should have researched about religion, custom and culture of Sri Lanka before she went there and considered the feelings of them. There are many differences of thought and culture in all over the world. We own must respect and consider people who have different idea so that we overcome our differences and get along with one another."
NBE03042,"Religious matters are very difficult and sensitive. This news said that the woman who has tattoo about Buddha were deported from Sri Lanka. Of course, some may think that this punishment is hard for this woman because she may not have known about the religious rules. But this problem is more serious than we think. She is not allowed for the just reason why she did not know about this religion in detail . In Japan, most people have no strong sense of religion. For instance, Japanese ordinarily celebrate Christmas and visit a shrine or temple at the begging of the new year's day. It seems natural for Japanese but it is abnormal for the other countries. The most countries have strong feelings for the religion like Arab states. In Saudi Arabia, even if visitors are foreigners, they must wear Arabic scarf. If they did not adhere to the religious rules, they would be punished. Thus, we should treat religions with more extreme cautions."
NBE03010,"We should embrace religious diversity. Prejudice of religion often cause conflict all over the world . I think that studying other country's culture is the first step in preventing religious conflict. Then, we should agree to differ each other. Certainly, religion is a sensitive issue to discuss. But, when I go overseas, check the taboo on ahead. Because I want to respect others as equals. I never blame Sri Lankan people by reason of having no common sense."
NBE03064,"I believe that culture and religion are important in the society. However, extreme use of these will lead a governmental issue. For example, China has been picked up in the news in the past few days for breaking down the churches. Chinese government has been threaten by the expansion of Christianity, which they assume that it can place an obstacle on the road to communism. This tells us that even though people do not believe in religious, we are some how connected to it, thus, we have to keep it in our mind."
NBE03054,"This news is difficult to understand because there are many cultures and religions in many countries. I think it is important that each country has culture and religion for oneself. However, if you make a trip abroad, you have to learn about the country's culture and religion. If you do not it, you will hurt people in the country. Therefore, learning about the country where you will travel is the most important to prevent religious conflict. I did not have undergo such a matter. When I made a trip abroad, I bought a book about the country before going to the country. Thanks to do it, I could have very nice trip. I understand her feeling, but being arrested is natural for people in Sri Lanka. In the future, I think it is important that each country keeps each culture and religion. However, it is also important to understand other country's culture and religion."
NBE03047,"It goes without saying that we should respect each other and not say this and that about his or her personal culture. Likewise, one nation should affirm another nation's culture, particularly in religious issues. But I feel that, in the name of globalization, more and more people are not respectful to other countries' culture. Although money, commodities, and people flows across borders everywhere in the world, regional cultures is a sanctuary away from such things. So, it is quite natural for people in Sri Lanka that the woman was arrested for ""hurting religious feeling"". I want the world to be more tolerant about cultural diversity. Of course, It may be too strict for her to be arrested. However, this is also part of cultural diversity."
NBE03066,"I think that the regional religion should be respected. Like this news, a certain action may be limited by a law. It is not a good thing to hurt the sense of other people by the action. However, because the personal sense of values that should be respected is included for the action, I think that it is too severe that an action listed in this news is a crime. It may be impossible that personal sense of values is completely respected. Therefore I think that it is important that each one has a heart in deference to another person."
NBE03052,"As for the Japanese, much religion does not have the interest. Therefore it may be reported that it is often rolled up in a trouble abroad. The problem about the religion thinks that handling is difficult. And it is an unfamiliar problem for the Japanese. Therefore I think that the Japanese has to get knowledge about the religion when we go abroad. I think that it is the best measures to prevent a trouble."
NBE03072,"Japanese don't feel importance of religion, but there are many conflict in the world. I don't know rule of various culture. So I will be confused in a foreign country. After reading this article, I thought I should learn cultures and religions of a lot of country. To live in the global society, we must respect and understand the life style each other. I hope the conflict will decrease by disagreement of culture and religion."
NBE03044,"Some religious rules are so difficult for people who don't believe it. The national rules and laws are also difficult for foreign people. When I read it, it is so important programs for us that we should understand a nation's law, rule and religion in advance, as we traveling foreign country. As the proverb says ""when in Rome do as the Romans do"", that's perfectly right . And the ideas is asked for us , when we traveling another country. There are any struggle between religion. So people should intend to understand and respect for each other and each religions. That attitude and ideas are importance for enjoying our travels and lives. And I think that will be linked to world peace."
NBE03023,"In Japan, religion does not have a deep meaning. I went to a Catholic school, but I am not a Christian and there was no problem. On the other hand, in many foreign countries, religion has given rise to wars. They are strong in faith and as for them religion holds absolute power. There is a big culture difference between Japan and countries with strong faith. Therefore, we should follow religious rules. I respect the proverb when in Rome, do as the Romans do."
NBE03034,"I was surprised, when I read this article. Ms Coleman was arrested only because she had a Buddha tattoo on her arm. This is absolutely impossible in Japan. Most of Japanese people are not interested in religion. They have little knowledge of religions. So, they may break a religious taboo like Ms Coleman. I think Japanese people must learn more about religion to build good relationships with other countries."
NBE03040,"I know that there are some country that are sensitive to the religious issue. However these incidents are beyond my expectation. I have no religion, so I enjoy Christmas Day, and go to a shrine on New Year's Day. In Sri Lanka, the religion is very important, different than me. I think tourists should be be careful not to hurt their feelings."
NBE03022,"I found very interesting things in this article First, there are some countries that a religion works as a law. In Japan, we aren't arrested if we do a sin. So it is difficult for us to understand this case. Second, there are always people who say ""We are not religious"". However, I think we are very religious. We can't insult our ancients and attack temples and shrines. Also we often say ""Itadakimasu and Gochisosama"" when we eat food. We show gratitude for everything, and I think this show our religious."
NBE03055,"In some countries, it is very important to believe in a religion. However most of us do not have a particular religion in Japan. For examples, we participate Christmas events, attend funerals, and pay their first visits of the year. I think it is because many religions came to Japan and mix with itself. Compared with other countries, we do not have religious issues such as this news, so I think it is not good to believe in it with extraordinary belief."
NBE03017,"i think it wrong for police to tell her she is breaking the law only because she has other religion. it is natural that people should have different religion, so it is not good to enforce a law about religion. in the end, everyone has freedom of thought, so we should respect each idea."
NBE03026,"I was surprised at this news when I read it for the first time. Basically, we Japanese don't have particular religion, and I think this is why I was so surprised at this news. However, each countries have their own religious background, and it is natural that people get unpleasant feelings when other people show disrespectful act toward their religion. We should consider and respect other's religious background."
NBE03060,"This is surprising news for us Japanese people. Because we almost do not have religion in Japan. People in other country usually have a religion and regard it as very important in their life. So we should understand other countries religions, their culture and must be careful not to hurt believer's feelings."
NBE03032,"I have never cared about other countries' cultures before I read this article. I think this news is difficult to understand for Japanese because they have little interest in religion. Although the act is not a problem in someone's own country, that act sometimes would be treated as a taboo in other country because of differences of culture or religion. If we go abroad, we must learn about the country which we will visit by reading many guidebooks in order not to be arrested at a foreign country."
NBE03038,"This case is very difficult to decide which side is right, because the woman certainly meant no harm, but we can't ignore the fact that her tattoo hurt Buddhists religious feelings. According to another article, some nations regard their religious precepts as formal laws. I think this article give a warning to us Japanese not to do unnecessary things in other countries, because almost Japanese have few interest about religions. In order not to cause trouble like the case, we should research the nation we would go in advance."
NBE03011,"There is a proverb, every country has its fashion. This means every country has various religion, tradition and rule. When we come into contact with a different culture or connect to people from one, we should learn and respect the culture. I think Ms Coleman was culpable for not knowing that getting Buddha tattoos is disrespectful although she practiced Buddhism."
NBE03067,"This case is a thing which told us a gap of cultures. We usually live in home country. We should learn the gap in this chance. In addition, we learn culture not only in different countries but in our country. I think that we can't understand that gap. So we should plan system in which we can learn cultures in different countries."
NBE03058,"I think it was natural that the visitor was blamed for this arrest. In my opinion, we should observe each custom in each country when we travel all over the world. Especially religious problems are so complicated and so deep rooted that we must care about it . However, in my another opinion, tattoo's design depends on personal freedom. So we shouldn't be pointed out about it. It is important that we have to be aware of our behaviors concerned with religious issue."
NBE03050,"Since as Japanese, almost all of us don't have religious beliefs, I presume it is very hard to understand this incident. So, maybe I cannot express my thought well. But i'll try to describe. Of course, it is true that we sometimes have to respect our culture, but to foreigners we should take broad minded attitude, that is, we should also express our respect for other country's culture. What i want to say is we should shift to a multicultural society. Yes, it is so hard, but we humans are different from animals in that we can sympathize others and help each other. So maybe it'll take a long time, but we can certainly create multicultural society. Thanks for reading."
NBE03019,"I think that religion has good aspect and bad one. Religion can control the thought of people who believe it. One thing, this may be the thing that this becomes like the custom of the country. For example, in this article, ""Sri Lanka is particularly sensitive about images of the Buddha"". On the other hand, believing the religion excessively isn't good, because people cannot think things flexibly. So, I think opportunities to think about religion seem to increase."
NBE03069,"I think that religion has a tremendous impact on thought of people. That's why different people have different opinions about this incident. Some people may think it is natural for her to be arrested, but other people may think the police shouldn't place her under arrest. So, I suppose there are a lot of different opinions about this incident because we have differences of religion, nation, and ethnic groups."
NBE03030,"I wasn't surprised so much when I read this article. Sri Lanka is famous in that it is a multi-religious country and most of people are Buddhist. They are know in that they follow the severe regulation that the believer must not eat meat. From this, we can know how much they value their religion, rule and Buddha. We are Japanese, we don't have certain religion. After all, the religious concept con not be understand by other races. Therefore we should follow the rule a little when we visit foreign country."
NBE03014,"When I read this article, I thought that it is important for us to understand cultures people who live other countries have truly as possible. I am interested in going abroad, so I am planning to make an overseas trip while I am a student. This article makes aware to me that not only to go abroad but also understanding other cultural backgrounds correctly is unavoidable"
NBE03056,I was surprised for this news. I didn't experience this case about discrimination. So we need to understand religion that it is different for ourselves. I notice this idea for this article.
NBE03049,"I think we must try to understand all countries have different cultures. Those troubles were caused by cultures' differences. In Japan, such troubles sometimes happens. For example, those who have tattoo can't enter many spas, swimming pools and amusement parks. And we Japanese are often scared of them. But in some countries, tattoo is a kind of fashion. Like this, when we touch in cultures, there are many differences of view point. So we must try to understand them. And it needs some interest about other cultures we don't know."
NBE03053,"People should follow the local rule or custom when they are tourists. Westerns say 'When in Rome do as Romans do' We also have a similar proverb. In the globalized world, people should respect . their culture each other. We should not do what you do not want others to do."
NBE03015,"I think Sri Lanka's punishment for a british tourist was a little strict because she practiced Buddhism and had attended meditation retreats and workshops in some Asian countries before. She didn't seem to insult Buddhism. However, also we should take care about religion and custom when we travel abroad. Some of our natural behaviors perhaps insult foreigners' belief."
NBE03016,"I think that this problem is complex. We should respect for those who live in the country when we visit a foreign country. However, people in this news could not predict this situation. It is important for travelers to prepare taboos before they leave. In order to avoid this situation, the best way is to avoid the countries with severe religious problems."
NBE03057,"I think every culture is respected and when we travel abroad, we should check that country's local culture in advance. This is because our sense of value is not always right, and we should accept various customs, cultures and ways of thinking. However, I think the woman's arrest is unreasonable this time. Of course the woman should check the culture of Sri Lanka in advance, but she was able to get permission to enter the country. If the country wanted to arrest the woman, they should have stopped her then. I think both a traveler and a country should make some efforts to know and inform their own culture properly."
NBE03045,"Different countries have different cultures. So, accidents such as this sometimes happen . Before you visit foreign county, you had better understand the culture of the county. Particularly, when religion is involved, you have to be careful of religion. Otherwise, you might be damaged."
NBE03065,"There is various religion in the world. Since Japan do not have a specific religion, and faith is free, i was able to believe my ears hardly in this incident of Sri Lanka. When we the foreigners get in touch with different culture, i keenly realize that i have to understand the culture well."
NBE03043,"I agree with your opinion that we learn cultures not only in differents but also in our country. I hadn't thought of learning our own country, so I am impressed by your idea. Usually, when I read some news like problems of gap of cultures, I tend to try to understand other country's religions, cultures, systems. Reading your comments, I realize it is important to understand our culture. If I understand other country's problems, cultures, and religions, it is no use to compare other country with our country without understanding our own country's knowledge. So, we would like to understand other country, we learn about our country first of all. That is so important, but I forget it. It is good for me to read your idea."
NBE03037,"This is a very difficult problem. It is unbelievable to me. However, everyone is free to believe in religious. So I cannot say someone is wrong. This help me travel abroad. One action is ok in Japan, but same action is NG in other countries. We should know other countries' cultures."
NBE03068,"I think culture and religion play an important role in every society, too. And I suppose we have to respect for difference of religion , and this action needs 'manner's border' ID14044 called. We should live together with people , who have different thinking , religion, and culture on the earth , so we have to get along with everyone."
NBE03020,"I think we should understand that there is a big culture difference between Japan and other countries, too. I also respect the proverb, and to do so, we have to take actions to have more knowledge about severe religious rules. Then, I believe more and more people enjoy traveling all over the world."
NBE03033,"I agree with ID14040's opinion. You should learn about the country where you will visit before you visit the country, if you want to enjoy your trip. Otherwise, you may make a trouble like this article."
NBE03041,I agree with this opinion very much. It is important for us to embrace religious diversity. Sometimes we are liable to decide things on our own's criteria. This is subjective. So in order to understand the others' cultures we must study about those and we need to get to know that there are many difference cultures in the world.
NBE03048,"I agree with ID14020's opinion. As he said, we Japanese must be careful to many differences between Japan and a country we'll visit. Besides, we shouldn't be prejudiced against people who have different religions, looks and habits without a right reason."
NBE03029,"I agree with ID13043's opinion. As she said, I think the punishment for the british tourist is a little strict too. She never insulted Buddha."
NBE03018,"This news clearly show that Sri Lanka whose 70% of the population is Buddhist is very pious Buddhism country. Since tattoo is one style of the fashion, it is not strange some pious believers feel bad that their God is treated carelessly. And It is also true the point of view toward religion is various in many countries, so we need to keep the phrase ""When in Rome do as the Romans do"" in our mind when we travel abroad."
NBE03013,"This British woman is from different culture background. Someone who come from a different cultural community is thought a strange and foolish man. They do not understand a different culture. I am a christian, so I know exactly how she felt ambivalence. Japanese did not accept Christianity at first. Most of us do not feel it familiar even now except Christmas. But what is different between Japan and Sri Lanka is that Japanese don't oppress people who don't believe in Shinto and Buddhist. Sri Lanka should learn kindness and tolerance."
NBE03076,Those troubles were caused by cultures' differences. I think that we should not force others to apply our standard of religion. It is so sensitive and complex problem. We should reconsider our behavior in other country.
NBE03012,I doubt we can do as you say. Because people do oppress when they truly cannot understand and accept a different custom basing on a religious background. So I think people cannot do everything carefully. I think we should conflict as long as it does not become violence or incidents. Until we do not collide with others we cannot help each others and understand them.
NBE03074,"Your example of Chine and Christianity are very good. Confrontation of religion and the policy of a country causes various problems. I also think that society and religion are inseparable things. Especially Japan, many people's conscious of religion is low. So we should recognize our own connection with religion."
NBE03059,"It is interesting your idea that ""religion works as a law""."
NBE03031,"When I hear this story, I was so shocked and felt that we must care of other countries taboos because we are likely to be arrested for doing taboo things, so if I go abroad, I want to check the countries taboo before I go. I studied various taboo on this class, so I want to study other countries taboos."
NBE03028,"When I heard this story, I was so shocked. I think it is really hard to understand the consciousness of religion of other cultures. It is so sensitive and complex problem. So if we go to foreign country , we must care about manners and customs of that country, especially religion."
NBE03039,"When I read this article, I was surprised. I think religion is free. English woman touched the taboo. we take it for granted, on the other hand some people think it taboo. we should respect difference."
NBE03036,"When I read this story, I was shocked and we should not force others to apply our standard of religion. It is so sensitive and complex and difficult problem. so we have to rethink many thing like such problem."
NBE03051,"Religion and culture are so different , difficult and complicated. Each country and region has peculiar them and people who come from other countries perhaps can't understand them. So, If you want to go abroad or other region you must study religion and culture local people have. Otherwise local people will possibly get angry with you and you will possibly be arrested. Even if you meant no harm , there are cases that you harm other people unintentionally."
NBE03035,"I think so. Different countries have different cultures. Before you visit foreign county, you had better understand the culture of the county. It is so important that you understand other cultures."
NBE03027,"I think you should study a foreign country's culture before you visit this country. Then, you can avoid many troubles."
NBE03024,Every country has their own cultures. Every culture should be respected like When in Rome do as the Romans do.
NBE03063,"I think that the religious conflict was happened from actions people had not concerned for people having other religions and customs deeply. People are not generous enough to tolerate people who hurt their spirits. Even among sharing same religion, people cannot show personal feelings. Why can we collide with others who have quite different sense of value?"
NBE03071,"I agree with your opinion and think it is nice to quote the proverb in order to suggest we respect the other tradition. I think the prejudice will be weak if we carry out following the proverb, so I agree with your opinion."
NBE03061,This is a problem of culture and religion difference. So I think it is not correct regarding this as a problem of gender.
NBE06811,"I agree with the word ""globalized"". Actually the apartment my living has a lot of foreign students, so I am needed to think more seriously about other people's religion, believes and cultures."
NBE07400,I think so strict. In Japan freedom of religions is protected. every country should do like Japan. We have to study about the country which we will visit and respect other country.
NBE07433,"I think that the difference of culture is here. Sometimes, the action that are forgiven in one country is taboo. So, we should pay attention to the behavior when we go to foreign countries."
NBE06812,"I don't think that tattoo give a good impression. In Japan, tattoo forbid in many areas. So, we should pay attention to the behavior when we go to foreign countries."
NBE03153,"When I read this article for the first time, I forgot myself in anger. Of course it is true that criminals should be punished by legal means, but they don't have to be in more agony than they have to atone for the crime they committed. I think the development of medical science should be used to ease humans' pains. We have to think more seriously about this problem because this problem is a matter of all people in the world. I suppose we should respect more for the rights of criminals and make better use of medical science to make all people happy."
NBE03145,"The way the US execute criminals is as same as cruel torture. This execution is against the principle of the constitutional states. The principle says Criminals are punished because they disturb their societies' peace and order. Therefore punishments including death penalty are not carried out in order to inflict pains on prisoners. The us are needed to carry out the death sentences in safer and less grotesque way. In the way, I was surprised that condemned criminals are killed by drugs in the US. In Japan condemned criminals are hanged. I think it is interesting in the way of death penalties."
NBE03100,"I was feeling keenly that killing by chemicals is a pretty cruel thing. I disagree with killing animals in pharmaceuticals. I have a dog, so it is unbearable that animals are sent to the health center by having discarded by owner and would be killed eventually, using such as gas or injection. Lethal injection, which exists as one of executions, I was well understood that the death-row prisoner writhed in agony pain and dead by reading this article. I think it is terrible that the process which a lethal injection had failed and the prisoner dead. However, I think that it's inevitable that the wrongdoer was suffering from lethal injections when we put ourselves in the victim's place."
NBE03128,"Capital punishment is, in principle, done as a warning of other would-be criminals, and I think that the nation's attitude to treat criminals according to the weight of their crimes cannot be criticized. However, too much cruelness make the nation's reputation and confidence lost. I think that the current way the US carry out the execution is so humane that it should adopt new and more humane way of the penalty."
NBE03135,"I cannot believe that the drug of using animals uses humans to execute capital punishment. This is because the injection may fail to work. The way of executing should use more humane and less prone to error. However, I think it is natural that a criminal feel the pain as the injured. Capital punishments need for criminal to atone for what he did. Using three drugs is more dangerous than using one drug. Therefore, if they use three drugs, they succeed in injecting absolutely. We should consider carefully about it."
NBE03122,"When I read this article, I think that capital punishment should be abolished. It is true that criminals are should be punished. But a false charge may always happen and recovery does not attach it after a capital punishment. Therefore, I think that the capital punishment itself should be abolished, before considering the method of a death penalty."
NBE03125,"When I read the article, first I think people who should be executed capital punishment take a pain is proper thing. But, every criminal is person, so they have human right. And when they are suffering from drugs , some executioner also suffering from their groaning. Their stress is so terrible. Just considering the two side , I think one drug to carry out lethal injections are better than three drugs caused acute pain. But, using some drugs and executing people are last method. So before we think what kind of drug we use, we should take it more seriously about the fact that we kill the person however he committed murder."
NBE03123,"The story about the execution of Clayton Lockett is very horrible for me. No matter how terrible crime he committed, he has human right. I think the way of execution should be decided by criminals."
NBE03078,"I think that the death penalty should be abolished. Why do we need death penalty? People who back death penalty are very illogical. First, killing people is very cruel especially execute someone by lethal injection. Second, life imprisonment has deterrent against crime in common with death penalty. In conclusion, there is no necessity to carry out death penalty."
NBE03161,"When I read this article for the first time, I was surprised at Oklahoma execution of Clayton Lockett. I knew that very cruel thing such as this execution was carried out actually for the first time by reading this article and I felt a sadness and a fear. The three drug method just causes a person too much pain, hurts people's feeling and gives people emptiness. I think this is a too cruel torture and no one come to be happy by it."
NBE03124,"This news made me sad. In the first place, there is still a discussion about morality of capital punishment. Because death penalty might violate human rights. In the way, Amnesty International is doing anti death penalty activity. In addition to this conflict, the matters about cruel torture may infringe on human rights more and more. Even if men who are punished are heinous criminal , they are human. So as long as the human rights are protected in constitution, they should be treated as honorable person. Thus if we agree with death penalty, we should activate the discussion about the way criminal are punished."
NBE03093,"When I read this article, I was very surprised and shocked. At the same time, I felt this was a very serious problem. Although I don't have enough knowledge of drug, I thought we all have to try something we can do to solve the problem because this is very important matter for all of us. I think execution by the three drug method is too strict for people however bad the criminal is. Therefore, I feel we should reconsider this kind of penalty seriously. Furthermore, I thought that I have to learn about law harder and harder in the university and I want to have more knowledge about execution."
NBE03150,"When I read this article, I was surprised very much. It is surely that the person who committed a crime receives a punishment. However, using three-drug method is too terrible. All over the world, capital punishment exists today. But, because a prisoner has human rights, not the death penalty, I think that the we should give different punishment. In any case, we learn about a law seriously and should think it."
NBE03133,"When I read this article, I felt that I was fierce. The Clayton rocket of Oklahoma has human rights as one human being, too. Therefore, in this matter, I think that it was an opportunity to change a thought about the death penalty. Presence and the human rights of the death penalty are very difficult problems. However, the death penalty such as the torture cannot be necessary."
NBE03156,"I didn't realize capital punishment was unbearable pain. Although Clayton rocket committed an inadmissible crime, the way he was killed is too cruel. We should think again about capital punishment. Because modern medicine and technology are developing, we can introduce better way of death. I don't think the death penalty should be abolished, but administration of justice need execute it after considering human rights."
NBE03094,"When I read this article, I was very surprised with that the official had allowed to use the untested drug. Although I don't think we should abolish the capital punishment, we must recognize prisoners as human. They have some rights as we have. So, we take care of them humanly. Some people say ""They are in prison because they killed someone or used drugs. So, it is quite natural that their rights are ignored. ""Although I can understand what they say and I have the same feeling somewhere in my mind, I think they are totally wrong. As long as we live, every of us should be recognized as a member of a society"
NBE03143,"I was surprised to hear that, in the United States, it ie allowed to execute death row inmates with drugs, in the first place. In Japan, drugs aren't used in execution. I wonder why the US take that way, and why they use drugs that banned from using to euthanize animals. To me, it sounds like humans are inferior to other animals. It is true that humans isn't superior to other animals in any way and that it is important to treasure them. However, humans are valuable, too. We should confirm that and reconsider the system of executing in the US."
NBE03112,"When I read this article, I was really surprised. Clayton Lockett killed people and raped women. So, he must make up his crimes. However, he has human rights, and no one can deprive of his human rights. The accident is too cruel treatment for him. I think that the US should stop using drugs to execute death sentences, because cruel accident like this must never happen again."
NBE03084,"I don't agree with execution using drugs which have been prohibited in the euthanizing animals. Certainly, criminals have to suffer punishments and victims desire it. However, punishments with illegal drugs go against humanity. We should take a serious view of humanity and think how they can correct errors."
NBE03144,"I think some chemicals used to execute death row should be banned. I am in favor of death penalty. Because some situation should do death penalty. But I think if they do death penalty, it must be quickly and it must not be painful. So, I think some chemicals used to execute death row should be banned."
NBE03137,"After reading this article, I felt that the execution of Clayton Lockett was so cruel that I cannot agree with using the three drug method. He was very guilty , however, this execution like torture had an ethical problem. So I suggest that we should not use that drug."
NBE03146,"I think this article is issue of natural right which a condemned criminal has. I disagree with using lethal injection. Because, we must not treat life lightly, even so, it is a condemned criminal's life. I have two reasons. First, if the drug fails to work properly, he die with suffering. Drug lethal injections have a high risk. Second, this drug may be smuggled over. For the reasons, I disagree with using lethal injections."
NBE03111,"When I was read this article, I was surprised that it is allowed to use drugs for execution in the US despite the fact that this way can cause acute pain and lead to grotesque scenes. I think it is unnecessary for people who commit crimes to give pain. I know it is natural that the criminals commit crimes, they should be punished. However they have human rights, we have to make allowance for them. I think execution using drugs should be abolished because of such reasons."
NBE03141,"I think people who committed sins need to be punished in any way. But it is nothing to say that they are ""people"" as same as us so we have to consider their fundamental human rights. Especially capital punishment is a disputable point. In my opinion, I don't disagree with capital punishment. This institution could restrain brutal crime. However, we must more care about the way. We mustn't occur the worst case , terrible process which a lethal injection fails."
NBE03139,"When I read this article, I can't believe this execution about using drugs. I had thought that using drugs are banned all over the world. However, I can't agree drugs uses lawfully in some situation. In order to solve this problem, I hope drugs would disappear in the world."
NBE03089,"I thought it a good way that we use a drug to kill a criminal, but I changed my mind. I think it a bad way. it is because it is cruel for us to use a drug. Rather than killing people immediately, using a drug makes people feel pain before their dead. It is true that using a drug does away with making persons kill a criminal with their hands such as push a button to kill a criminal. But using a drug makes them see a situation that a criminal feels pain. It makes persons uncomfortable, and they go mad, if they see the situation too much. For the reason, I think that we should not use a drug to kill a criminal."
NBE03079,"Recently, capital punishment is greatly debated. The point is usually its morality , whether to do away with. At any rate, we should hold human life in high esteem. Even death-row inmates are human, so their rights should be respected. Therefore, I think that employment of capital punishment should be sedate and easy for them."
NBE03159,"I think using the drug administered to the death penalty is a bad thing because Mr. Dennis and Rocket died given the suffering and punishment beyond their crime, and pain. I think that this is not good ethically. There are two reasons. First, the most of effect of current drag is uncertain. Second supposing medicinal medication goes wrong, The family who are looking will be a lot of shocked. The right explanation is given before using. But given the science and technology of today, we should refrain from the use of the drag for death penalty."
NBE03131,"There are a lot of comments that say""It is morally bad to execute people by using drug cocktail""I presume that this theme is very interesting. In my opinion, I think so too. It is true that an offender should be punished , but that should not be capital punishment by using drugs. That measure would give them more pain than what they did. But I think capital punishment is needed. Because, I think that capital punishments deter crime. So we have to change the way to execute."
NBE03140,"When I read this article, I had mixed feelings. I think euthanasia is not necessarily bad, cause we should have the right to chose our ends (I don't approve of the idea entirely, thought). But, If we make the choice by drugs, we have to examine many times before using them. We cannot examine it with people, so we will use animals. It is the same thing for death penalty by drugs. We have to avoid the problem like Clayton Lockett. However, we should think about the right of animals at the same time. It is the so difficult matter."
NBE03107,"When I read this article, I was surprised and shocked. Of course, Clayton Lockett must be punished for the crime of killing people. However I think that he shouldn't be executed in a way that ignores human rights. He is a human too. Should he have died struggling? But If I were a relative of the victim, I wouldn't say the same things."
NBE03096,"I was shocked to hear the news. A criminal is also a human being, so his life should have been treated more carefully. This is not my opinion, but from Christian point of view, it is said equality under god. Also, in this accident, lethal injection was untested. So to speak, he was a testing bench. Even though he was a condemned criminal, his life was only one time and I thought his last should have been calmness."
NBE03118,"When I read the article, it made me surprise and I felt so sad. Before reading the article, I was for execution by using drug, because in terms of criminal's human rights, I thought this method seemed to be better than shooting or hanging. However, considering the terrible case, I changed my mind. Using drug is no less cruel than shooting or hanging. Apart from the problem whether or not we should abolish death penalty, we have to reconsider the method of execution."
NBE03101,"Before reading this article, I am completely agree with the idea of the death penalty with drugs because I thought the criminals could die in piece and with no pain by this method. However, my feeling toward it had totally changed. It can be as cruel as other methods such as hanging. Most of us the Japanese are for with the idea of capital punishment, but maybe we should reconsider whether we should adopt it or not."
NBE03127,"At first I think it is a humane way to execute inmates with drugs. But as I read this article, I noticed that there is a possibility of being cruel and precarious. Though Clayton Lockett is a criminal, his human right should be defended, I think."
NBE03142,"I think using drug like lethal injections for execution is humanitarian, but this situation is not. Actually It is sure that Clayton Lockett committed serious crime. No matter haw he is brutal criminal, he is a human and has human rights. And it should be defended."
NBE03155,"I think this news shows how indifferent to other's life we are . I agree with execute inmates with drugs if a condemned criminal can die without pain. However, in fact, we treat their life carelessly. We should improve our consciousness about other human's life."
NBE03126,"Before reading this article , I thought that using drug for execute criminals is good in terms of human right. However, after reading it , I came to think that we should stop execute or find other ways to execute . Of course, criminals are bad and punished, but they also have human rights . we should respect them for protecting our human rights"
NBE03152,It's surprising for me to be different between way of execute in US and EU. But I'm convinced that it's natural to be different. For many things are different around the world. But I think Clayton's matter is crucial. He killed a girl so it's natural for him to be stated death penalty. I think he wasn't have to dead suffering. So we should work out a way of execute.
NBE03087,"I felt sorry for Clayton Lockett when I read this news. It is true that the crime that he committed is too cruel. However, nobody had the rights to give him unjust heavy pain in this country governed by law. I am for capital punishments, but I believe that we can respect for the criminals to some extent when he is executed."
NBE03148,"The famous artist was arrested by drug possession yesterday. i often hear the news caught in drug possession I have the experience which actually refused the drug. It takes courage to refuse a drug. However, it is an important thing In order to keep its own body and the future. . ."
NBE03129,"I felt sad to read this news and remembered the Nazis. I think the execution of Clayton Lockett is impossible because it infringe his humanity. He killed people, indeed, but it doesn't mean losing his humanity. What I was most surprised at is that officials have allowed this execution. Criminal law of U. S is different from that of Japan, but I think humanity should be saved in all countries. So the death penalty must be abolished."
NBE03099,I agree your opinion. As I thought it is cruel thing that killing condemned criminals using three chemicals. But I also there is no help for it because the criminal constituted that much serious crime. We should consider how to execute in order not to be too terrible while we incorporate and opinion from a point of jurisprudence view.
NBE03083,"I agree with your opinion. We should think carefully about using some drugs, because it cause acute pain and deprive criminals' human rights easily."
NBE03077,I don't agree with you. I can't take forever to decide a way to die. This decision is very cruel. The death penalty should be abolished completely. It is the best way to protect of human right.
NBE03160,"I agree with you. The most basic human rights are treated apart from careers, characters and so on. I think that they are absolute and must be secured for every humans all over the world."
NBE03138,"I don't agree with you. I think it is necessary for a criminal like him to execute. This is because if there is no capital punishment, a criminal will increase. And you said his life was only one time, but it's unfair that he isn't executed instead of having murdered. However he shouldn't be killed like a torture since he has human rights and it's against ethic. This idea is the same as you."
NBE03117,"I agree with you, but I think Death Penalty is absolutely wrong way to punish criminals, because I believe no one has the right to kill a person, even a government. So, Any method to execute criminals should be allowed."
NBE03154,I agree with your opinion. We should use science for human's benefit even if the receiver is criminal.
NBE03121,I agree with your opinion. I think that we should abolish death penalty. Life can't return after death. miss judgment may occur.
NBE03086,I do not agree with you. I don't think that the countries governed by law should allow criminals to decide the way of execution. The way of execution should not change by feelings of criminals.
NBE03130,"I agree with you. Of course, criminals should be punished in some way. but that shouldn't be capital punishment. Capital punishment has a lot of fault. For example, If we execute someone by accident, we can't resuscitate him or her. So we have to abolish the practice of capital punishment."
NBE03147,I agree with your opinion. I think human right is equal. Execution is not right for dignity
NBE03163,I agree with her opinion because I think she understands the danger of drug.
NBE03090,"First, I was very very surprised at this news. It may be true that Clayton Lockett suffered much more than when he was killed by drugs smoothly. I think EU should export drugs for capital punishment to the U. S because the death penalty is legal in the U. S and drugs from EU are necessary for smooth execution. By doing so , the U. S don't need to use the three drug method but can use the one-drug method and as a result, smooth execution will be realized, I think."
NBE03095,"I agree with this comment. There are many different points around the world. For example, food, clothes, greeting, courtesy, and so on. This is a matter of course, but there is one thing to be common to all, importance of human life. No matter how different their culture is, human life should be treated carefully."
NBE03081,"The medical law is not organized very well. The situation is very similar in Japan. American should obey the law. Also, they should confirm the existence and importance of the medical law. But the problem is there is not unified code. I think the code is necessary in this modern society. In this code, they should establish the rights of those who is performed medical treatments and even those who is imposed death penalties by drugs. By this code , although it is innovative and lawyers and jurists don't claim the code is legitimated, people can change the relationship between those who perform and those who is performed fundamentally."
NBE03164,"When I read this article, I was really surprised. Before reading this article, I am completely agree with the idea of the death penalty with drugs. Now, however, I think the death penalty must be abolished."
NBE03116,"When I read this article, I was very surprised. I think capital punishment is necessary. But using three drugs is not humane. They are criminals, truly. However, they are humans too. So we should think better of it."
NBE03082,"Death penalties should be banned quickly. In Japan capital punishments have been executed for a long time. As the opinion of the minority, They think because constitution in Japan says ""The infliction of torture by any public officer and cruel punishments are absolutely forbidden"", putting somebody to death should be stopped. In this article, person which passed death sentence was treated badly. I think it can't be the doing of a man in his senses."
NBE03080,"I disagree with you. Because an alternative penalty of capital punishment must be a life sentence. But people don't bear living in a prison whole life. And most of death penalties result in prisoners being overwhelmed and become crazy. So we certainly respect the rights of life of people, by abolishing death penalty, also we violate the personal rights. Therefore, I think we mustn't abolish death penalty. And we introduce a life sentence. And prisoners can choose which sentence should be executed. It is related to not only the criminal law the medical law, such as the problem of euthanasia."
NBE03157,"I almost agree with you. Capital punishment should be abolished. Present science technology and court system are insufficient for performing a death penalty. But, we must not forget that death punishment becomes a deterrent of a big crime at the present time."
NBE03092,"I think we should not say easily that death penalty is bad or it should be baned. It is because death penalty work as prevention not to commit a felony which sentence a person to death. It is sure that people must respect one's freedom to live. However, ie there is no death penalty, terrible accident would increase. So I think death penalty is better than increasing a lot of terrible crime."
NBE03109,"I was surprised that America uses chemicals to do executions and sometimes they lead grotesque scenes. Japan has hanging for death penalty and these ways of capital punishment are both cruel, so I think that we must think more kind way of death penalty."
NBE03106,"When I heard this news, I was very surprised. It may be true that Clayton Lockett suffered much more than when he was killed by drugs smoothly. Japan has death penalty too. We should consider about this problem."
NBE03151,"I think so, too. Although they killed men, they have human rights. So we should respect their human rights. We should make a low which they can respect ones."
NBE03085,"I think it is important to adopt new and more humane way of the penalty, but finally we should aim at the society which don't have any death penalty."
NBE03091,"I think so too, because if there is no death penalty, terrible crime may increase. However, I think it isn't best execution. So, we need to reconsider the method of execution."
NBE03114,When I read this article. I was so sad and we should not occur such thing. Death penalty must be banned quickly from all over the world. That is because it is not compensation.
NBE03105,I don't agree with you. I think that death penalty is needed to all over the world.
NBE03088,"I agree with you. I think we have little knowledge of drugs. So we should learn about drugs. If we do so, drugs won't be used carelessly."
NBE03132,"Death penalty may not be compensation and rights of criminals condemned to death may not be respected, but criminals did victims harm very much. Criminals robbed victims of rights-to-life and made many people sad. So I think Death penalty is needed."
NBE03158,"I have a counterargument in your opinion. It approves of your opinion of the first half. I thought that this incident was shocking. However, I think that your idea of ""deciding a punishment by the person's crime"" is not good. The weight of people's life is not compared. The weight of a punishment is not compared strictly, either. A punishment should not be changed with criminal importance, but a death penalty with medicine should be abolished. I assert abolition of capital punishment."
NBE03134,We must explore the way of euthanasia for a death penalty. Condemned criminals are cruel but I think we do not need to let them feel pain when they die.
NBE03108,"I strongly disagree with your opinion. It is because without capital punishment, the weight of a crime will be lighter even if it were a murder. So I do not think that we must abolish capital punishment."
NBE03113,I agree with you. I think execution using drugs which have been prohibited in the euthanizing animals is not good.
NBE03103,I think death penalty should be abolished and I fear drug being used to punish criminals. I feel using drug to kill animals will lead to using drug to kill criminals some day.
NBE03104,I think so too.
NBE03098,"I think the story about the execution of Clayton Lockett is so horrible and cruel . To be sure , he committed crime but he is one person and he has human rights . So this news shocked me ."
NBE03097,I think death penalty should not be abolished but I think using drug to kill animals is bad thing too .
NBE03162,"I am opposed his opinion. Although he asserts the abolition of capital punishment. If a convict says why a death penalty is used, I will be because the crime of only that was committed and will think how it is that asserts only the protection of human rights."
NBE03136,I agree with your opinion. I think that we should abolish the capital punishment. I also have heard the death penalty costs a large sum of money. I think it is not necessary to spend much money on the death penalty. I think that anyone who perpetrates a crime should be treated one of the human beings.
NBE03110,"I strongly disagree with your opinion. I do not think that we should abolish capital punishment because without capital punishment, the weight of a crime will be lighter even if it is a murder. I think it is strange. So, I do not think that we must abolish capital punishment."
NBE03102,"I also believe that the death penalty should be banned. Everyone, even murderers, has human right. Even the court shouldn't let anyone die even they committed something terrible."
NBE03115,I agree with your opinion. I think human rights are all same. Execution is not right for punishment.
NBE03149,"I think that capital punishment is culture. People will be rewarded if he commit the crime which should be carried out death. Seeing historically, the death penalty existed from ancient times considerably. Japanese people think that we should not stop capital punishment for the reason other countries do not accept a death penalty. we should have an opportunity to discuss on humane grounds."
NBE03119,"I agree with you, but I think Death Penalty is absolutely wrong way to punish criminals, because I believe no one has the right to kill a person, even a government. So, Any method to execute criminals should be allowed"
NBE03120,"I strongly disagree with you. I believe capital punishment should be abolished as soon as possible, because everyone has the fundamental human right and no one should not invade the right."
NBE06279,"I don't think that death penalty enables us to keep our society safe, and I hope death penalty be abolished anywhere in the world."
NBE07434,"I think this way of penalty is not good. Because, he dose not only regret his guilty but also this penalty is too horrible."
NBE03176,"I have ever made vocabulary notes by using only Example 1. But I surprised to know that there were several kinds of example. I think Example 4 is the best way to remember words because a word is associated with other word, so I will be memorize them smoothly. Also, Example 2 is one of good ways that we rewrite it with other English words if there is a difficult word. We can improve our English expression skill considerably. I'm going to make cogitate vocabulary notes by referring to these examples."
NBE03169,"I have been made my vocabulary notes like the first example and sometimes wrote stresses. But this way is laking to learn a language. When I read this article, I was interested in the second example and the third example. If I use the second example, I will use appropriate words instead of difficult words. If I use the third example, I will learn a lot of synonyms. So, I want to use these examples when I learn a language."
NBE03207,"I have memorized English vocabulary by only using the first example, but sometimes, I felt that this is not efficient enough. By reading this article, I found the useful way that I want to use next time. Among five examples, I'm interested in the second example. By using the second example, I can memorize words practically because it uses example sentences and these are good for seeing how words work in real situations. From now, I would like to try this example when I study English!"
NBE03195,"I have not made a vocabulary notebook until now. However, through this class, a vocabulary notebook had various forms and knew that there were a good point, a bad point each. I wanted to make a vocabulary notebook after having understood it. I think that English results might improve a little more if I make a word notebook in high school days. I want to learn the word in future without idling about."
NBE03213,"I think the third example is best. I had been making the vocabulary notebooks as the first example until I read this topic. However, I knew that there are various kinds of vocabulary notebooks and I came to like the third example by reading it. Because the third example is categorized cleanly, easy to read and we can memorize many words which are connected mutually the same time. I think the first example is so simple and good when you study English vocabulary for the first time. The second example is too difficult for me because I'm not good at English very well and it is written in only English. The forth and fifth examples have too many words in them and difficult to read a little."
NBE03197,"I have made a vocabulary notes like the first example. It is easy to make and to memorize a vocabulary. However, I think the third example is the best way to memorize. This is because it is written parts of speech and meaning in Japanese. Therefore, I understand the vocabulary easily. Besides, I think also the second example is a good vocabulary note. Understanding a English vocabulary in English is the most important to study English. however, it is difficult for people who is not good at English. I will try to use the note like the second example when I memorize vocabularies."
NBE03165,"I use the first example of vocabulary notes all up until now. But, I think the third example is easy to remember. When I came up an unknown word, learn some related words at the same time. This is a rational approach! Then, I write some example sentence as well as words. I want to speak English fluently."
NBE03174,"When I read this article, I reconsidered the way of making vocabulary notebooks. I have been studying English for a long time, however , I haven't thought about the role of vocabulary notebooks or what should I do to make them more better to learn English. Therefore, I found this article very important for me and I thought I have to try not to forget the importance of vocabulary notebooks. When I was a high school student, I didn't use the English-English dictionary frequently, but this article made me find the importance of understanding the English meaning. The reason is that I think the English meaning is much better to understand the English words meanings than Japanese meaning. Furthermore, we can tell another people the real English words meanings in English. From such reasons, I think I will utilize the English-English dictionary more often!"
NBE03210,"I think the third example of vocabulary note is best. When I was a high school student, I used the way of making vocabulary note. because the way of writing made me read and understand the meaning and pronunciation and collocations. I have forgot the importance of device to make note more effective, so I will take note the by the way of writing."
NBE03211,"I have made only the first example of vocabulary notebooks, but this article taught the way of studying word to me. I think the third example is beneficial . It is efficient we learn related word at the same time, and pronunciation is very important to speak English. After this class, I felt I am not enough the amount of studying English word. So I want to study vocabulary using these way."
NBE03208,"I always use the first example of vocabulary notebooks. But, watching some examples of vocabulary notebooks, I felt that my consciousness changed. Because a vocabulary notebooks shown in the example than the vocabulary notebook which I used so far is relatively more useful. For instance, if I use the second vocabulary notebook, I can learn the meaning of various words at the same time. I make such a vocabulary notebook and want to raise one's command of English from now on."
NBE03189,"I usually make vocabulary notebooks like the first example . The reason why I made it like the first example is it is so simple to see and easy to make it. Reading this article, I learned some ways of making vocabulary notebooks. And I learned the most important thing for me is whether I could master some words. I understand meanings of words , however, I cannot use the word well. In other words, I should change my vocabulary notebook style into new style which can be learned collocations to speak and write smoothly. Although it takes many time to make new vocabulary notebook, I don't care about it, if I come to speak and write smoothly. So I would like to try to make vocabulary notebook using a world maps. I'm glad to learn about many ways of vocabulary notebooks and each of these style's merits and demerits."
NBE03180,"I have ever made vocabulary notes like the first example. I realized that this way seemed to be easy to remember, but it was not effective. No matter how I memorize only Japanese meanings, I cannot understand how to use the words in English. That's why my English skills do not make progress. So I would like to practice to make notes like the second example, because this way shows me example sentences and synonyms. I think this way helps me to understand deeply and to improve reading skills. From now, I try this way, and make efforts to be good at English."
NBE03188,"When I learn vocabularies by heart, I make a notebook which I wrote English words in the right side and in the left Japanese meanings. Always I was bothered to memorize these words. These words which I learned by rote in this way were difficult to come up with. So always I was wondering which is the best way to memorize English vocabularies. Through this article, I understood that in order to master the English vocabularies there are some requisite points like synonyms, pronunciations, word maps and so on. Especially I am thinking that the most important part is example sentences. It is because it makes no sense if we cannot come up with the word which we want to express. From this time, I am thinking that I change my way to memorize the English words."
NBE03172,"I think the second example is the best way to brush up our English skills. Example sentences give us a chance to infer the meaning of words. We can improve reading skills by inferring the meanings , I think. I used a vocabulary notebook which included various example sentences when I was a high school student and I was be able not only to remember a lot of English words but also to read English sentences smoothly later."
NBE03204,"I thin the third example is best because we can read the note easily. The note tells us meanings of words, different forms of them and also pronunciations. This type of notes are seen in vocabulary textbooks we may have used when we studied for entrance exams. Those textbooks are easy to use for studying. However, I have made a note that is like the first example. My note can tell readers little things. I want to make my note have more information."
NBE03198,"I often make a vocabulary note like the first example. But if I study English using that vocabulary note, I can not know how to use some English words and listen to them. So I want to make vocabulary notes like the second example. However it is the most important thing to study vocabulary notes over and over because we can not memorize English words just one time."
NBE03181,"I think the third example of vocabulary notebooks is the best vocabulary notebook. It is because the third example is easy to see, and there are many information about words, for example, Japanese meanings, pronunciation and word families. You can learn many things about one word, if you use a vocabulary notebook like the third example. My vocabulary notebook is like the first example. It is easy to see, but there are only English words and Japanese meanings. So, I will change my vocabulary notebook like the third example."
NBE03200,"I think the third example is the best, because I think ""a part of speech"" is very important elements when we read the foreign articles. We have to judge the word's part-of-speech in an instant if we would like to read them quickly and accurately. In addition, pronunciation is almost very important when speaking in foreign language. The third example includes these good points, so next time I make a vocabulary note, I will refer to it."
NBE03175,"Vocabulary notebooks help us understand English words, so they should be easy to see and have a lot of information. To be specific, collocations, example sentences, and word families are important. Fourth example and final example include word maps. Word maps have a lot of information, but they look complicated. I think second example is a good vocabulary note book, because it is written in only English and we can grasp how to use words. I want to try to imitate second example."
NBE03201,"I have never thought of the efficient vocabulary notebooks. When I study English words. I always use the first example because it is so easy that I save more time to remember the words instead of making vocabulary notebooks. However, from now, I want to adopt the second example. The second example is like an English-English dictionary. The good point of the vocabulary notebook is that we can improve the skill of explaining the meanings of English words in English!The skill is useful especially when we have presentation. We are preparing English presentation now, so I want to make good use of the learning."
NBE03212,"I have ever not contrived to make a vocabulary notebook. I have only written English words and Japanese meaning. This time, I could know many type of the way to remember English. I think number 3 is the best way. This is because the indispensable thing to study English word family, pronunciation, part of speech- is written in it. I am not a native speaker or returnee children. So above all, I have to remember correct spelling and understand right meaning. But, if I can skill up English skill, example 4 and 5 will be a valuable pattern because studying connection of words make text easy and deep."
NBE03185,"I think the vocabulary notebook is very important because writing new words helps us to remember them. However I have never care about its style. My vocabulary notebook is similar to the first example, but I think example sentences should be written too now."
NBE03191,"Making vocabulary notebooks has been my habit since I was a junior high school student. First I have written English on the left. Second, Japanese meanings, the word's pronunciation, accent, synonyms, English meanings and collocations. But my usual way is not clear at example sentences - when and how I should use the word. So I want to write example sentences, word family to grasp the word."
NBE03173,"I wrote the things which should memorize it such as words since study for examination thoroughly and remembered it. Specifically, firstly I learn it by Japanese translation. I write in the investigation, an example sentence at a notebook with an English-English dictionary, and the illegible thing learns it by the Japanese translation next. I will continue in future and want to make an English study."
NBE03177,"I have made my vocabulary notebooks like the first example, however, after reading this article, I noticed that it is not enough to learn how to use the word naturally. It is important to use the words naturally to speak like native speaker of English, so I will try to make my vocabulary notebooks like the forth example to improve my english speaking ability."
NBE03193,"I have made the note like the first example. But it isn't often useful when I study new sentences written in English. Because an electronic dictionary is better than it every time. I think the third example is the best notebook of all. But it isn't worth making vocabulary notebooks. There're two reasons. first, they take you many times. Second, it's pretty hard to find the word you want to know in them. On the other hand, an electronic dictionary is easy to use and find. So I think they should be made so as to get self confidences and motivations if you make them for the reason, I'll agree with you."
NBE03170,"I have made a vocabulary notes like example 1. It was most important for me to memorize as much words as possible when I was a high school student. However, what I am required to do as a university student is to convey my feelings to both native speakers and non-native speakers in English. Therefore, we should understand English by English, not Japanese. I think the second example is the best vocabulary notes."
NBE03190,"Before reading this article , I had used only example 1. However, I realized more effective ways of talking vocabulary notebooks . In my opinion, we should use various ways of doing it , according to occasions. For example, if you want to improve your collocation skill, you had better use example4!"
NBE03179,"I think that the vocabulary notebook is important for studying English. The vocabulary notebooks help me memorize Japanese meanings of English words. But I haven't thought about the way of making vocabulary notebooks. Now, my vocabulary notebook has only English words and Japanese meanings. I intend to take many collocations, word families in my vocabulary notebook from now on."
NBE03166,I think a memory tree is one of creative idea to memorize many words. I can memorize more words using colorful notebooks than a normal monotone notebook. I tried to make it rule to memorize words by a memory tree. But it didn't work very well. I want to make memory trees all the time I study.
NBE03182,"Everyone thinks that the vocabulary notebook is necessary for studying foreign languages, but like the examples in the article, there are a lot of types of how to make vocabulary notebooks. If you adopt a wrong methods of making them, it would be not only inefficient, but also do harm than good, just like taking wrong medicine. As for me, the third examples is the best, because it is very easy to understand what the English words mean. On the other hand, the fourth and fifth example are bad. The style of word map is very messy for me, and the style is inefficient to learn words because it doesn't place the Japanese mean."
NBE03209,"I have ever made a memory tree like an example 1 when I was in high school. But I think my memory tree was not detailed and difficult to find information. I think an example fourth is the best because there are a lot of information and every words are put in order, so it is the most useful memory tree. I will make effort to make good memory tree like an example forth."
NBE03194,"To improve your English ability, I think second example is the best. I presume that the more you use foreign language, the faster you can learn. It is important for learners to actively use the language which they want to master. It is true that other ways to learn are also good, but , in my opinion, the second example is the best!"
NBE03199,"I like second and third example. These are easier for me to understand what to write. The other is good to get a lot of information. However, it is more difficult to read all information immediately. So I like second and third example."
NBE03192,"I think that the second example is the most effective in understanding English words and increasing vocabulary. If you want to read English smoothly, you should not ""translate"" it into Japanese. You should just practice ""reading English as it is"". The second example is very good in that it gives you plain definition and example sentences only in English. Without translation, you will be more familiar with English, which makes you better at using it."
NBE03205,"I think that the Example 3 is the best notebook. It's because there are pronunciation and word families. When we memorize vocabulary, Example 3 is good notebook because we can know related matter at the same time. So I think Example 3 is the best notebook."
NBE03183,"I think the second example is the best. Indeed, it is easy for us to understand the English words in Japanese. But vocabulary notebooks in English are more useful. Because we can remember more words and imagine the words. Therefore I think the second example is the best."
NBE03202,"To ID14046 I have also used the first example and from now, I also want to adopt the second example!!!The second example is like an English-English dictionary. We can memorize words practically because it uses example sentences as you say. We are going to have English presentation today, so I will try explaining the meanings of English words in English!The skill we have acquired by using the second example is now displayed!"
NBE03184,I agree with you!
NBE03214,I use the second example of vocabulary notes until now. This time I know many kinds of vocabulary notes. So I'll reconsider the way of making vocabulary notes.
NBE03167,"I have not regard making vocabulary notebooks as important doing, so I hardly did that. So I didn't know appropriate vocabulary notebooks. people around me have nice notebooks, and I found that it makes my memorizing English words easy, and this article introduce many examples, so I want to make my original vocabulary notebook."
NBE03203,"I have made many vocabulary notes ever. But after read this blog, I have never made vocabulary notes that can be useful for except exams. From now on, I will try to make vocabulary notes like example second that is useful for not only exam but also real conversation."
NBE03196,"I think simple is the best. Because efficient things are very beautiful and SIMPLE. I do not need any extra information, People do not often check the vocabulary notes so extra information makes me confused."
NBE03206,"I tried to make word book by the second and third ways. However, it takes a quite long time. Recently, I have had a lot of English homework. I have not have enough time to collect words by these ways. Therefore, I have made my vocabulary note by the first way. I think that first of all, I need to make a more efficient plan about what I should do and to carry out my own plan."
NBE03168,"I have not taking to make useful vocabulary notebooks into consideration. So, I found that making such notebooks make me so easy to learn not only English words but also collocations. In this article, I think forth example is particularly good. Because I often memorize only words that I read in something, but this article may help to give chances to get other words. I want to try to do it."
NBE03171,"I use Example 2 because all english words give me skills to write or read. But, the practical way to master English is to learn parts of speech, pronunciation, word family and etc. Therefore, I decide to make an effective notebook which includes them."
NBE03178,"I have made the vocabulary note when I was high school student. I have to memorize a lot of English vocabularies. So, I made it and read it during commuting time to school and free time. It is so useful because it makes me memorize this vocabulary meaning, pronunciation, part of speech and example sentence. I want to make vocabulary note again to pass English proficiency test."
NBE03186,"I was convinced by this comment. I usually use the first example, but I will try to make a vocabulary notebook next time."
NBE03187,"The simple is important, but not the best in the case of vocabulary notebooks. Extra information doesn't seem to confuse us because we usually look at only what we want to know."
NBE03227,"When I read this story, I thought we didn't know what the war was exactly. At the same time, I found the importance of the real story from people who live in which the war happened. It is true that we all learned about the happenings in the war when we were high school students, however, I think it is the most important that we have more chances to take actions to understand the war. Also, we should not consider the fact not being related to us. This is very important incident for all of us in Japan. According to this article, Japanese education puts too much attention to Tokyo. Therefore, I want the government to reconsider the curriculum."
NBE03218,"Many people pay attention to the contents of the textbook. But it is necessary to obey the law. And the town should obey it. The teachers of Taketomi teach not only history but also moral as a subject. Do they really think their children will grow up honestly and get the skill as independent adults who have citizenship, even though they break the law because of their biased views of left-wings?Taketomi should keep the law as a role model of the children."
NBE03264,"It is a very difficult problem. we should learn the second world war from various perspectives. But it is impossible to unify many perspectives about the war into Japanese formal history. A national history is an important element of the nation. So Japanese government is reluctant to teach wartime mistakes. In this case, I suggest that teachers in Taketomi teach the town's history not only civil textbooks but also hearing survivors story and visiting historical sites about the war."
NBE03221,"We should offer all the students uniform education. It is true that it is important not to forget the tragedy. However, students who receive compulsory education cannot doubt what their teachers say and what textbooks say. Therefore, we should not have accepted illegal states. If you think that one law is not proper, you should change the law. Ignoring law is not right."
NBE03226,"I don't know what is correct about this problem. However, I think that teachers who know the truthful history should tell students it. It is because if they don't tell the fear of World War, students and also we can't understand the fear of war. We, particularly teenagers, are not so interested in war problem. So, I think that it is necessary to educate youth not to repeat the same mistake."
NBE03232,"I think the idea that the Japanese government decides the content of the textbooks is wrong. If it were possible for the government to decide it, the government could easily manipulate citizens will, and this is the same way which was introduced in the wartime. We the Japanese should never forget the experience of the wartime."
NBE03259,"I'm able to understand Mrs. Nakamura's opinion. I'm always afraid of prejudice because sometimes we cannot find it, and I think education is one of the most contributory ways to make it. Like North Korea, if I was taught ""Our country is best and justice. "" from early childhood, and every adults around me said it, I would definitely believe it. A big authority can provoke people. We have to know about the fact and it is necessary to always doubt whether our thinking or education is right or not."
NBE03231,I thought that the textbook problem is difficult. Many Japanese people especially the young like me will not know the war in detail because we had never experienced it before. So publishing companies should write truth of the history and society concretely and make textbooks and we choose textbooks that we can think it useful and justice to study the best. I think it isn't good for nations to become pushy like dictating textbooks.
NBE03249,"It is true that Mr. Abe's aim is to make Japan ""strong"" again. In fact, he argue that Japan should grow out of the post-war regime. But I think this poses the misunderstandings. He do not want the nationalism of the Empire of Japan to be back. In the flow of globalization, which make every nation connected with one another in terms of economy, social system, thoughts, and cultures, Japan is now losing its influence in the world, particularly in the East Asia. I think that a little conservative educations have potentials to change that situation. Although there is a lot of dispute about the contents of textbook (and I do not support extreme nationalism, such as affirming the war), ""patriotic spirit"" is now necessary to make the nation more tied, as well as taking account of Okinawans - who suffered from the painful war."
NBE03276,"When I was an elementary school student, I had an opportunity to talk with a person who explained Word War Two. She said ""I was taught that Americans are very evil in our school. However, it was not true. After the war, I found out that they are ordinary humans and very kind. I remember that an American soldier gave me a chocolate. I think Americans are far more kind and gentle than Japanese"". I think that textbooks influence student greatly. we must defense pacifism and it is important in education."
NBE03273,"We don't know what is true about the war, so contents of textbook have a major influence on learning children. There is various perspective in history. To see whole of history is difficult and sometimes textbooks are written conveniently. So we should have always critical thinking, which will help us understand how is the war. Not only we change perspective, but administration should reconsider how they teach children history and what is education."
NBE03235,"When I read this article, what I thought at first was that education was powerful and could have danger when it mistake to step. I was frightened with Japanese education during World War Two. In other words, education is a kind of brainwashing. It has power which change our mind and our ways of living. Nakamura and her classmates were brainwashed by adults are militarism. This row about textbook is very difficult. I don't know which is right because I haven't experienced war and I am not from Okinawa. But what I want to say is only one. I hope that all young people receive right education so that Japan would not follow the same horrible way."
NBE03228,"We can learn from this article that history education is very important for us and it effects its power on us. So its necessary to understand the right story. However, recently, there are some different interpretation on the same story and it sometimes cause international problems. For example, Japan and Korea have different interpretation on a part of WW2 each other. As the idea of globalism spreads to all over the world now, we must consider which story is the right."
NBE03220,"I think we should take care about textbooks, especially when they include history. Because, we are influenced by textbooks easily and they are important tools when we learn about history. Textbooks should inform it neutral. Also, we should learn about war from people who really experienced it. They can teach us true stories, but they are aging (about 70~80 years old) and opportunities we can meet them are declined. So, we should convey true stories from them to next generations in order not to repeat disastrous war."
NBE03256,"When I read this article, I wanted to learn about the true of World War II. We are convinced what Japan did in the war by education in Japan. I know that American in the war have an apologetic that killed many Japanese. They are very kind people. I think the education has led us to prejudice against Japanese history. Therefore, what is written in textbook does not give the correct information in talking about Japanese history of ever to us. A young people like us have to learn the true of Japanese history. Japanese have to accept any history to discuss fairly with China and Korea. I want a chance to take the correct education to learn about the true of the history in Japan."
NBE03215,"I oppose to use textbook compiled by the state. It forces majority value on children. Don't impose majority values on minority. Everyone should respect human dignity. Otherwise, we repeat the history of tragedy of war. I think that local school board makes free decisions about textbooks. Japanese government should ensure freedom in education. We should imagine Okinawans people."
NBE03263,"I agree with Sadako Nakamura's opinion. The war should not be happened ever. Sometime I think Abe check China a lot and poke Japanese patriotism and he want to change the Japan constitution. If the constitution will be changed, Japan might be militarism. Textbooks are same. I think textbook should not be changed. If it will be changed, students might be brainwashed."
NBE03222,"I think it important for us to be taught the world situation exactly. According to the sentence, in the past, children were not taught world affairs. I think that it would cause a lot of problems. For example, if someone didn't know the fact that there are some colors people in the world, the person would discriminate them. It is so important for us to understand world affairs. So it is wrong for us to teach the world situation in error. But We still have problems that we sometimes teach the world situation wrongly. At first we should understand the situation and teach the situation in details."
NBE03246,"I think that all of schools in Japan should use text book including the same contents. But a board of education in Taketomi should obey the law so that people in Japan are not fell in confusion. If teachers would like tell the students another story using other text, they do so. But they also teach common contents using a common text. They need to explain the difference carefully for their students. And history is so difficult and complex problems. So we need to learn and consider a problem from different angles to deepen our's knowledge about it. Not only schools in okinawa but in Japan learn about many opinions about history problems . And student think how do you feel, if you can't make your answer is no problem. The important is the process and the fact that students are thinking about it ."
NBE03253,"I do not know most about this problem. However, I know that I must never fight. We have a duty to hand down misery of the war. However, you must not twist history education of Japan on account of the country. It is a difficult problem, but there is the thing which you must protect."
NBE03242,"About 70 years have passed since WWII was over. 1945, when Japan seemed likely to lose, have witnessed a lot of tragic events. Battle in Okinawa, the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Potsdam Declaration. I think every event has to be taught at school and every Japanese have to remember them. However, I heard that some young people don't know when the atomic bombs was dropped and when WW@@@ was over, and to make matters worse, some of them don't know there are tragic war against USA and British(United Nations) during the 1941~45. In order to break down such present situation, I want the government to put emphasis on historical education."
NBE03257,"I think a civics textbook should tell us what happened in World War Two exactly. World War Two broke out about 70 years ago, so those who experienced it are declining. That's why we have to listen to old men's war story carefully, especially Okinawa. This is because we must not break out a war and make Okinawa a front-line sacrifice again. Therefore I don't agree with Abe's determination to nullify the pacifist constitution."
NBE03237,"Textbooks have a big influence when children learn some things. However, sometimes, there are wrong descriptions in textbooks, so those lead students to understand wrong facts. The contents about WWII are very severe. There are different opinions between Okinawa's education boards and Japanese government. I think the former should choose textbooks, because there are many people who experienced WW@@@ in Okinawa and people who live in Okinawa think about the war much stronger than Japanese government. This textbook problem is difficult . It must spend time to solve it."
NBE03251,"Once, Japan was very strong country in Asia in terms of economy, force, and so on. But with the globalization that connects all over the world, and the rise of various Asia country like, China and Korea, Japan has lost her position. So, to take back former dignity, Mr. Abe may act hastily. I'm not good at politics, but what I can say is history is extremely difficult, and there are a lot of viewpoints . So There's not any right viewpoint. But what I can say with confidence is everybody think the same thing , that is, ""Peace is an important thing for everyone"" So, I would like the top of the countries, in other words, prime ministers and presidents to establish policies to create peaceful world."
NBE03229,"69 years have passed since the Second World War came to an end, so few people know the tragic accident. We should listen closely to those people. War is one of the most terrible incidents and the only people who experienced it know how the war is. Of course I did not think only Japan was wrong, but I cannot judge whether my opinion is right or not. Today, recognition of history is regarded as important, Japanese prime minister, Abe, should think about war carefully."
NBE03271,"Two years ago, I went to Okinawa for the school trip. I went to the cave where a lot of citizens sought refuge at World War 2. I felt cruelty of the war and I can't forget what I felt at that time ever. The reason why I disagree with Abe's policy is not a logic, but the feeling at that time. I don't want my family and friends to die in the war. I think the tragic affair like World War 2 mustn't do over and we have to find how to realize the peaceful world without war."
NBE03248,I think Shinzo Abe may be a nationalist and a little dangerous. He seems to want to revive warped patriotism in wartime. It can cause military conscription again. We should never go to war with any other countries. We should do everything possible prevent terrible tragedy from happening again. I felt protecting democratic and peaceful education is the most important thing all over again by reading this article.
NBE03274,"I think a textbook specifies children's thinking. Therefore, we should become earnest for choosing a textbook. First of all, it is not so good for a children that country and rural areas decide a textbook. Biased and simple of people's thinking may cause a running wildly of the nation. I think in order to stop that bat situation educator has to teach that a textbook is only one of the opinions."
NBE03277,This is a difficult problem. It cannot be discussed without correct information and opinions of various viewpoints. So we should study. And I think it necessary to educate young people not to repeat the same mistake.
NBE03272,The influence of textbook is equal to brainwashing. The powerful person of Japan should take reader's damage of heart caused by war.
NBE03250,"During the war, the education was used in order to justify nation's policy. In fact, there were wrong things in the textbook of the day. this article said ""She and her fellow townspeople want no more of Tokyo-Electric education that glorifies the nation and recognizes war as a just national expedient. "", and I agree to this. I think Thus resistance against Officials must need not to break out the war again."
NBE03245,"I think that text book which is used in junior high schools and high schools should be written in the very right things. Of course, there are so many different interpretations among people. It is because interpretations are changed, depending on the individuals who feel differently on the same situations. But historical facts which Japan occurred could not be changed. For example, Japan government has an intention to legitimate the incident which did holocaust in Nankin in China. I understand many misunderstandings by Chinese bother Japan. But in Japan students are not taught about such things in detail. Thus we students want to know about the right historical facts and government should be more obedient to the historical facts."
NBE03262,"I think education is very important. For children, adults are absolute so if adults teach wrong thing, children would believe. In this case, people who live in the area hate Tokyo because of their wrong education. I think the right of option for education is in people live in the area."
NBE03243,I think that we have an each opinion on war. It is bad that some people reject other people's opinion. We should respect people's opinion.
NBE03247,"After reading this article, I feel that I don't know what the war in Okinawa is like and we should forget it and tell next generations. In order to do so , we must study status of Okinawa. Japanese education put importance on Okinawa."
NBE03268,I know the war has a some reason. After all the war is prohibited.
NBE03266,i am afraid of president. okinawa is the important place. so he should be more careful.
NBE03238,"When I read this article, I feel that we should learn more about World War Two. In Japan, there are few people who went through the war. So, we must ask them the story about the war to understand the terror of wars before they died. We must also transmit the terror of wars to posterity. I hope wars will disappear from the world."
NBE03269,"I know the war has a some reason. Of course the war is prohibited. However, it is not a bad thing to tell about war even if that war is bad. This is because we must not forget terror of the war. So, I think that the education to teach misery of the war should be done from now on."
NBE03267,"Okinawa is some Japan. Now, the problem of the right of collective self-defense is subject. When war occurs, the place which is related first of all is Okinawa. The problem of Okinawa is not every person."
NBE03258,"I think that it is difficult to determine whether it is right for current us because there is really little what person was experiencing this war. However, we must not forget it about war and think that I have a duty to try to do right understanding. You must write the truth to the right textbook which is used at school so that it is understood. I think that you must let children study the truth. As well as a thing of Okinawa, I think that it is necessary to let the nation do right understanding about the war whole to prevent a thing same as twice from happening."
NBE03224,"I think an idea of the Taketomi is very cool. Since Mr. Abe took office as the prime minister, Japan has had a tendency not to regard the war absolutely bad. In addition to this, Tokyo was not the battle field and only places which were invaded seriously can hand down the tragic story to the coming ages. So cities like Taketomi should voluntarily make an original textbook by which children can feel the reality of the war and understand how terrible the war is and consider how to eliminate the battle between or among nations."
NBE03219,"I felt like something doubt the truth of true when I read this article. Children learn history through textbooks. The contents of the textbook must have a significant impact on children. In this article, I was aware of the existence of women tell the meaning of the war. I think there good or bad, but I think I want textbooks to tell the importance of the real war to children."
NBE03234,"I agree with Sadako Nakamura's opinion. The war should not be happened ever. I think that everyone should tell the children truth. By doing so it, I think that we consider this problem carefully and children can do right choice."
NBE03241,Histories have a lot of varieties . Each people have various opinions. So sometimes histories cause troubles. I understand both sides. We have no correct answer that one of them is wrong. We need more time to reach an agreement.
NBE03260,"I want to agree with Mrs. Nakamura's opinion. We tend to forget the prejudice. Also, education can be the hotbed to do so for students. The knowledges which are taught in childhood is difficult to erase and change, so we should be more serious about the fact and it is always necessary to criticize whether our way of thinking is right or not."
NBE03261,I thought that the textbook problem is difficult and histories have a lot of varieties . Each people have various opinions for them. But i think it is important that telling truth for next ages with textbook.
NBE03270,"I think the problem of textbook is popular. Textbooks reflect editor. So textbook can intently be distorted, but they should tell truth as possible as."
NBE03265,This is a quite difficult problem. It cannot be discussed without correct information and opinions of various viewpoints. So we should study. And I think it necessary to educate young people not to repeat the same mistake.
NBE03244,I want the countries including Japan to keep good relationships because I love peace. Wars must not be happened again.
NBE03239,"When I read this article, I think This problem is very difficult and complex. I can understand each sides. I think each sides are correct."
NBE03225,"I think so too. War must not be brought about again. Not to make serious battle between nations, we also have to hand down the tragic story of the past to the next generation."
NBE03216,"I think textbook problem is very difficult. Children don't have the ability to think critically. Therefore, teaching a partial world view in Japanese history means brainwashing. Education should be provided in neutral place."
NBE03252,"Education has two sides, virtue and vice. Depending on the its content and way it can be used for peace or war. So people who educate other people must think them and their happiness. All education which people who don't think it do are bad and wrong."
NBE03254,"I think nobody likes a war. However wars occurred, is ongoing and will never perish. This is a political and also diplomatic issue. But we can avoid the war. That is why Mr. Prime minister is now trying to change the constitution. He would not like to start wars and repeat the tragedy such as the battle of Okinawa in WW2."
NBE03255,I think stories of the people who underwent the WW2 are important and we have to respect them. However many people experienced the war so each of them has their memories about it. We should not focus on one story. We need to search a lot of stories and analyze them.
NBE03223,"I disagree with your opinion a little. Indeed it is true that we have various opinions respectively and we must respect them, but the war is clearly bad thing and to hand down the tragic history to the coming age specifically is clearly good thing."
NBE03275,"I disagree with your opinion. I think it is terrible that the government try to plant some radical ideas to students. However, I think it is important to deciding some contents which every students should learn by the government."
NBE03217,"I disagree with you. Because you do not know that the content of today's textbooks of national history is also wrong. The standard of selecting information today is unclear. make matter worse, if we want to publish, we only have to find it is written in something without backing. And a lot of national hIstoric societies are left wings. So they published textbooks as they want. And Abe try to change this situation, and protect children's rights of education."
NBE03233,I support Taketomi's decision because Taketomi choose right choice and resist nation's power for children.
NBE03230,"Wars killed many people. So nobody want to do wars but wars often happen. Therefore , for not to do wars , we should educate children ."
NBE03240,I agree with this comment. I had a school trip to Okinawa 3 years ago. We studied about Okinawa and listened to the person who survived the WWII. High schools in Japan have histories class. But it can't teach all histories. Japanese government should give the chances to study histories more.
NBE03236,"I felt sad when I read this story because Okinawa was only place of a ground war. I think that Japanese government should rewrite our text book of history to tell children truth. Sorry, I was absent from this class."
NBE05969,"It is important to think about the World War II. But we must think about it. There are a lot of opinions on the premise that it is not again cause the war. For example, Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution say that it does not have any forces. What is the force? Is ""Jieitai"" the force? I don't know because the Constitution does not specify. So I think the government should establish the definition of neatly forces in provisions rather than the interpretation."
NBE06628,"When I read this story, I realized we didn't know what the war exactly was. At the same time, I learned the importance of the real story from people who overcame the war. I think Japanese government ignore opinions local people have. Japanese education curriculum Abe tries to make is too conservative. We should learn World WarII history from various perspective."
NBE03333,"Japanese do not have an obsession about any religion, but that is rare. Many countries in the world have problems related to religion. They believe in the absolute one that is different from a religion to another. This difference results in conflicts. In this case, it is not about the war but it is also connected to the religion, and the risk of being arrested is on us. We should understand it and when we are in a foreign country, we have to do everything carefully."
NBE03335,I think that culture and religion are very important in the society. I think that we should make manner's border clearly so we can get along with other culture. We should respect each other.
NBE03296,"We can get many informations easily and early in contemporary information society. Gaining information by using internet is very convenient definitely. But there are some informations which has a bad influence on children's education or is aggressive content such abusing. I think that erasing some aged and harmful informations for people though freedom of expression is indispensable to protect human rights. However, we should restrain ourselves from uploading impertinent information and internet search engine is necessary to censor websites whether there is bad information. If we keep in mind to use internet carefully not to hurt feelings of internet users, we can enjoy using internet comfortably."
NBE03323,"The modern information-intensive society was very convenient and brought us profit. However, the problem occurs as information-intensive society develops. We will have to think about use of the Internet deeply some other time. I want to use it as convenient contents without troubling another person."
NBE03317,"We should think of the pain of people whose personal information is betrayed. They are suffering from being on the Internet forever. This is very painful problem. Although there is one viewpoint that we have the right to know information, we should also consider the feelings of such people. It is the age of Information technology. In such era, it is necessary to build basic privacy policy that protects human rights on the Internet."
NBE03278,"Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. But, everyone can't violate the privacy rights. I think that we should give preference to protect privacy over freedom of expression. Freedom of expression is used for people. With this case as a start, we need to know about the potential dangers of the Internet. It was impossible for Internet offering to vanish."
NBE03325,"We should be care about the personal information does not leak to the network society when we use the internet. The modern network society is essential to our lives, but there are many parts you do not know yet. This is most dangerous to use the internet. Obtaining the information from the site of no credibility and putting the information of others without permission is source of leaking to personal information. It is important to understand danger of network society to use the internet. We should consider the privacy rights of the individual with the public's right to know and distribute information."
NBE03320,"Now, we live in a world surrounded by a lot of information, and it isn't too much to say that this is the age of information technology, that is Internet users have been coming thick and fast and easily obtain a tremendous amounts of information. Although it is necessary to respect one's rights of privacy, it is exceedingly difficult to classify what is important information and what is not. For everybody has his or her own thought, a sense of value and so forth. So, on one hand we have to think about one's own privacy, on the other hand we should distribute information with a mind not to harm one's feeling."
NBE03334,"It is true that the right to know information is important. However, the Internet is new, so we could live without information about things far from us. On the contrary, we can be sick mentally if we are known about us reluctantly. Because of these thoughts, I think that the right to be protected our own information is more important than the right to know it."
NBE03290,"When I read this article, I felt very shocked. Also, this problem is very severe problem related to our history so we have to think about that carefully. In my opinion, the impression 'sex slaves' is clearly bad to describe Asian women forced into Japanese military-run brothels during World War II. I have heard the similar news and watched the scene that the politician who had made a bad impression apologized. In such case, I think what is the most important is not just ' apology' but 'feeling' toward women. If they had paid attention to women's feeling, they wouldn't have made such remarks. Therefore, I think we should consider this problem well and as a woman, I don't want to hear such news any more."
NBE03347,"In modern society, we can know a lot of information. But we don't say the problem is true, and it is difficult to distinguish the difference. The influence of internet is terrible, so we are told to use it carefully. However, if people are too anxious, they can't use the right to know. The relation of expression and privacy is difficult problem. We must use internet to know beneficial information."
NBE03300,"When I was read this article, I felt this problem was so difficult. I think both the privacy rights of the individual and the public's right to know should be protected for all people. However, these are contrary each other relating to what it secure. In this case, it is not the best that we judge Google is wrong. Because that this ruling threatening freedom of expression is fact. I'm going to watch the battle between Europe and America over the balance between privacy and freedom of expression."
NBE03289,"These days, there are many problems which caused by Internet. For example, hacking, addictive online game, and about personal privacy. And I think personal privacy can't be indifferent to us. It is because a lot of people, particularly the young, using SNS. For instance, twitter, Facebook and so on. those SNS are interesting for us, but those are also dangerous to use. So, it is good for us to get the right to remove out comments and photos on SNS."
NBE03313,"When I read this article, I thought that this problem is very difficult. Because there is the conflict between people's rights to know and the privacy rights of individuals. Thus I think the both rights are important for us. For instance, we need to know about politicians which govern us in order to elect better people in the parliamentary democracy. In addition to this, someone who are eager to remove the information including privacy should have the right to erase that. Like photos which are taken unwillingly. Base on the above I think that the most important thing is our understanding that the internet is public and every people can see. So we should be always careful about what we are going to do in the internet."
NBE03342,"Today, various information came to be exchanged on the Internet and became the very convenient world. But, the current information-intensive society is not necessarily only convenient. Especially, it is that personal information flows out. Like this news, the thing about the personal information is the one of having to pay attention. All the things which we can do is not to write in personal information easily on the Internet."
NBE03314,"It is difficult problem between the right to know and privacy. I think that the problem is occurred by the fact that people do not know the precise border of these . For instance when one person insist on the privacy rights, a problem would come under privacy. But it is also able to come under the case of the right to know. Even if the news is not true, the news is so worse as to spread widely to people on the Internet. I suppose that is the most fearful point . In my opinion, the privacy rights is more important than the right to know. Because there is no way protecting the privacy rights without erasing information. But in case of the right to know, there are many ways people get information. It is true that the Internet is so convenience getting a lot of information, but people should understand that it is not always that say correct things. People should get information using many ways, and need to compare these ."
NBE03292,"In my opinion, building the law which is written in this article is not collect. Although the Internet causes many problems, it is true that we take many benefits from it. We can share a lot of information, buy something, work in our house and know a lot of things. Before building the law of limiting the Internet, we should make right attitude of using the Internet. Without our wrong attitude, there are no problems of the Internet. I think the people who don't have ""Internet manner"" shouldn't use the Internet."
NBE03280,"This article is associated with various human rights. They are freedom of expression, free speech, the right to privacy and public right of access to information. Google concluded that they took the measure of whether the information is personal or relevant to public interests. Though it seems to be reasonable, it is horrific for Google as a general firm to have the option to release information. So Google will be able to erase the information that has embarrassing problem for it. This regard may be a moot point."
NBE03303,"Nowadays, we can use the Internet easily by using computers and cellphones, and we can get a lot of information from the Internet. the Internet is very useful, but we have to be careful about how to use the Internet. In Japan, many people use SNS, for example, twitter, Facebook and LINE. We can communicate with people all over the world by using SNS. However, there is the danger that our personal information leaks out. So, We must learn how danger the Internet is, and protect our personal information by ourselves."
NBE03293,"With the spread of the Internet, personal information has been exposed to danger more. Of course, the Internet makes our life easy and convenience. However, leaking out our information may lead us to the irreparable accident. Therefore, we should be careful about disclosing personal information. There are various kinds of opinions about right to be forgotten. I think the most important thing is protecting users. I hope the Internet will be safe for all those users."
NBE03318,"In this news, the European Court of Justice made its landmark ruling search engines to save ""right to be forgotten"". It means individuals have the rights to erase data that they no longer wish to be in public. On the other hand, though Google agrees this opinion in public, they point out two things. First, this ruling has possibility to threaten ""free speech"". Second, individual interest isn't same as public interest. I think Both of them have right opinions. But I'm for the Google's opinion. because we use the Internet after understanding some risks. if you want to delete your embarrassing photos, you shouldn't upload them. At the present time, we can lock our accounts in SNS. I think not a system but manners are needed now."
NBE03287,"I think it important for our privacy to be protected. It is because our privacy is equivalent to our lives. If our privacy spread to the world, our lives is open to danger. It is true that the freedom of our expression is important for us and it also should be protected. But, when we compare former to latter, we probably think former more important than latter, that is, our privacy should be protected more carefully than the freedom of our expression."
NBE03302,"Today, many people use social network services such as Facebook or Twitter. Through them, it is possible to know what a friend did in yesterday, where a celebrity went or what a strange man wants to do. This means that we are monitored by everyone. I think that we have the right to freedom of expression, but we must care about comments on the internet. Careless comments will cause serious troubles. We should learn how to use the internet and guard the own privacy."
NBE03344,"Recently the number of people using the Internet is becoming bigger, so the problem between the privacy and the freedom of expression. I think it is danger to lean toward the one party between the right of privacy and the freedom of the expression. I suppose that nowadays a lot of people are looking just at the freedom of the expression . People should pay more attention to the right of the privacy because there are a lot of crime on the Internet and their privacy could be invaded."
NBE03312,"The issue about the balance between privacy and freedom of expression is very difficult to solve because both are important. However if I have to decide which is more important, I choose privacy. It's age of the internet now. We can know information about individuals with the internet. It means it's possible to be known our privacy by many people. Freedom of expression should be limited to live with sense of security."
NBE03337,"I think it is a very difficult and complicated problem to balance the privacy rights of individual with information distribution. Maybe, there are no solutions to manage this problem. For example google says it investigate whether there is a public interest in the links users want removed. However, there are many people on the internet who severely attack other individuals who are seemed to be guilty and strange. Google and other search engines are needed to solve one by one problems."
NBE03329,"This article makes me think deeply about the use of information from the Internet. On the Internet, there is a lot of bad information for children, but they don't know how to keep away from them. And not only children but also adults are put in danger of losing their privacy. Of course the freedom of expression is very important, but if we access so bad information or lose our privacy, our safe life may be deprived. This is more dangerous situation, so I think some kinds of restriction is necessary to protect our good life."
NBE03349,"The problem of the balance between privacy and freedom of expression is difficult. However, I think privacy should be respected and individuals should be able to erase data that they no longer wish to be in public. The Internet is very convenience but so terrible. Information spread wider and it is left longer than we think. There are very important and private information on the Internet, so I think that the ruling is necessary to some extent."
NBE03315,"Today, we can get many kind of information, including someone' s private information which can be harmful for the person. So, the search giant, such as Google, should not let people search someone@@s privacy unless the person allows people to do it . However, we have to remember that everyone has the right to freedom of expression and protect it."
NBE03345,"I think that the privacy should have priority over the freedom of expression. If our privacy is leaked on the Internet, some people may abuse it and we will suffer heavy damage on the financial or mental damage. Thus, I think Google's decision was right."
NBE03328,"Internet is convenient and we can get a lot of information easily if we use this. However, we may impress badly if we don't use it suitably. We must know how to use it surely. Many people in all over the world are using internet. So a lot of problem occur. However, our private information or problem mustn't open to the public. Thus, these have to be protected from this danger. In addition, we must remember that everyone has the right to freedom of expression and protect it. Thereby, it is necessary to receive Google's decision."
NBE03348,"I have been convinced that Google attitude for this time judgment. Because this problem is too important. Many unspecified persons look the information on web site. Since the past information is always accumulated, it may differ from the present information. So it often change to an obstacle of a certain person's life. Now, information is power. I think that it is not good to erase information easily by only Google. This is a big problem that we consider all together."
NBE03316,"In this age of Internet, we can get various information about anything. It is so convenience, but the other aspect, it is dangerous and privacy is remarkably easy to be leaked. And I think many people lack sense of crisis to release our own information on Internet, for example Face book. Therefore we have to protect own information. So I think the right to forget is important."
NBE03332,"Today we can get any information from the internet. But it is sure that there is informations like having bad influences for young ages. However we must regard about freedom of expression. So, before uploading any informations we must think how other people feel when they see these informations."
NBE03339,"I disagree with the ruling. Because, the right to be forgotten could strengthen the hand of repressive governments. Between governments and social media have an interest in rights. So, governments should guarantee free speech. But, We also should learn how to use internet. We must be careful, don't leak of information. Having done that I think we don't need the right to be forgotten."
NBE03326,"I agree with ""right to be forgotten"", which is to erase data that individuals no longer wish to be in public. If I meet someone and tell him my name, he can search my information online. So it could not protect privacy. We should have human rights to keep our privacy a secret. However government and politician's information have to be free for us to search because we should also have right to know."
NBE03286,"I think that this ruling is wrong in some ways. It is true that our privacy should be protected. However, we should not belittle the influence of this ruling. Freedom of expression is essential for democracy. We need to have the rights to criticize our government. If we had not freedom of expression, we could not avoid personal dictatorship. We have to pay attention to a leak of privacy by ourselves when we use the Internet."
NBE03284,"I think search engines should listen to people who want links about them removed, because we have to protect our privacy. However, we shouldn't leak our information easily. Although we think it is less amount of our privacy, it can be the hint which suggest to our important information, for example, our passwords."
NBE03309,"I agree with the ""right to be forgotten"" . Today, many people use SNS in Internet, connecting with all over the world. No one is perfect, so people often contribute wrong (or inappropriate) articles to SNS. Therefore, many people want to clean their murky past from their SNS. For this reason, I think it is nonsense to condemn the ""right to be forgotten"" even though many people need the right."
NBE03343,"In this article, the right to be forgotten threatens free speech particularly in America. Although free speech will be threatened, I think that our privacy should be protected. In recent years, our privacy has been threatened."
NBE03311,"When I read this article. I think that we should use internet considering its merit and problem, because internet may be dangerous. in fact internet is fun, but if we use internet mistakenly, we will be in trouble."
NBE03305,"When I read this article, I think it is very difficult problem. certainly the privacy right is important thing, but we must not neglect the right to know. To solve this conflict, it is important to talk each other and compromise."
NBE03308,"I understand that links make ex-convict's life more difficult. But I disagree with the statement that people have the right to be forgot. It is true that many pictures which were taken without awareness are on the Internet. However, most people don't have links that they want to remove. Normal lives doesn't produce such links. So the right is unnecessary. It has no problem unless they commit a crime."
NBE03336,"When I read this article, I think it is serious big problem. I am against with this ruling. It is because the right could strengthen the hand of repressive governments. If I can choose which is more important, I think I will choose privacy. There are a lot of dangerous and risky things in internet. I think we should more careful about privacy."
NBE03340,"I use the Internet every day. Therefore, the Internet manners must protect. The Internet is also convenient and has also entailed danger. since -- careful cautions are required."
NBE03288,"I think Google's decision was good. Indeed we have the right to know and information should be put on view, but we also have the right to make our disgraceful information be secret, moreover, delete it completely. This is why if we are unable to delete the data or information which we think shameful, we may suffer a serious loss in the future. For example, a 4th grade university student whose bad information is kept on the Internet database may be rejected by the company not on a basis of his ability or skill but on a basis of his conduct of the past. Taking into account the impact on the society in the future, we should be given the right to make what we don't want to be revealed invisible."
NBE03324,"I think that searching engines needs kind of rights not to forget. Because, public opened information on the Internet limits people's actions. The right to remember should be necessary. People who will not be the criminal are none of their business. People just need to be a polite."
NBE03282,"Internet is very useful, and it is very familiar with us recently. Everybody has something not to be caught dead for example former pictures. If that is uploaded to Internet, we can't erase that easily. Especially, we, college students, often use SNSs. SNS makes us easy to share everything. We are living cheek by jowl with the danger of this. If we do so, can we do nothing? I think this article may be so a familiar problem with us."
NBE03299,"Everyone is within there rights to express freedom things. At the same time, however, everyone can't violate the privacy rights. I often use SNS such as twitter, facebook and mixi. These are very convenient and make our lives enrichment. We have to coexist with these properly."
NBE03301,"I agree with right to forget . when I published my shaming photo, I want to erase it as soon as possible. At the same time, the freedom of expression of one who surrenders is not protected, so we should think about this problem. Generally, people tend not to like be published their shaming things, so I think that right to forget is winner."
NBE03297,I am skeptical about the right to be forgotten. Search engine such as google is one of the important ways to know what kind of person when hiring someone or in the similar situation. We should learn from the past fault rather than try to erase it.
NBE03350,"Recently gaining information by using internet is very convenient definitely. Of course there are many dangers, but if we learn the use of Internet, we can live together comfortably."
NBE03331,"This theme of this article is protecting privacy vs free expression. These days, we can't live our daily life without information on the Internet, but we have to think by ourselves about whether it is true or not. Also we should be more aware of the fact that there is no security when we use the Internet. Especially, when we provide the Internet with information, especially that of privacy, we have to reconsider about dangerous and risky things which are caused."
NBE03327,"I agree with your opinion because the Internet is not only a good influence for us. It is good that a lot of information is got, but, on the other hand, it is a fact that there is a lot of unnecessary information. I think that it should prevent these information from adversely affecting youths."
NBE03306,"When I read this article, I think privacy's right should be protected. This is most important thing of all things. we should spread it more and more."
NBE03295,"I think that some informations will need for us if it is far from us. Although the information doesn't seem to be related to us, it might be very important for many people including you."
NBE05023,"I disagree with your opinion. I think that some informations will need for us if it is far from us. Although the information doesn't seem to be related to us, it might be very important for many people including you."
NBE03322,Internet is very useful to gain much information quickly. I use and need internet now and in the future. But sometimes internet exposes our privacy and hurt us. I think steps for internet is lack and technology advance.
NBE03285,"I strongly disagree with you. It is true that our privacy is important. However, we have to consider an important role of a freedom of expression as an ingredient of democracy. It is essential for democracy to be able to say what people want to do. Furthermore, we can guard our privacy by being careful about how to use the Internet to a certain degree. The law to regulate a freedom of speech in order to prevent a privacy invasion."
NBE03330,"I disagree with your comment. This theme of this article is protecting privacy vs free expression. It is true that , as you said, we should be more careful about privacy. However, these days, we can't live our daily life without information on the Internet. Also, we have to consider about the right of the free expression. We should be more careful especially when we provide the Internet with the information. Now the age who use the Internet is younger and younger. I think the necessity of education of the media literacy will increase."
NBE03279,I think so too. Personal information should not be leaked to the network society essentially. But in developed network society it is nearly impossible. So we should understand danger of network society to use the internet and nurture media literacy.
NBE03281,"I understand that American put a stress on the right of free speech. But it is for resisting against the government as one of the right of resistance. So they should budge from their opinion. American amendments is not necessarily the right under natural law. For instance, US constitution amendment 3 as follows, ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. "" Of course it is not common conception of all the people in the world. people who is in different countries see it as a dangerous article and also see the devotion of the rights of life and safe of a lot of people as Rocke said. The matter of the rights of free speech is specific in America. They say they independent from Britain because of the King's oppression. Of course this story is a doubtful and controversial problem. But the dignities of individuals more important. And we should respect them."
NBE03304,I agree with you. this problem was so difficult. I think both the privacy rights of the individual and the public's right to know should be protected for all people. However. it is the best thing to protect the privacy rights of the individual.
NBE03321,"I agree with you. People must adjust themselves to their surroundings which internet makes now. In order to do that, we have to think the relationship with internet."
NBE03294,"We should keep and protect our rights of privacy . However , we also have rights of freedom to know . So it is complex problem . W e should try to find the best way ."
NBE03298,"It is true that by internet we can get information easily , but we must not forget to protect privacy."
NBE03291,"He said that, the right to be forgotten seems to be more important than the right to know. However, I think we cannot decide which is more important, right to know and right to be forgotten. Of course, ""privacy"" is a key word in this society where there are a lot of information. We can easily get them from the Internet, and I think the smartphone might help us to do that. At the same time, I can't say we don't need the right to know. If we lose the right, that means, we lose the safety because we cannot know what the government do now, for example. Although this kind of news is severe problem but we all have to consider about this."
NBE03338,"I disagree with the ruling too. Because, the right to be forgotten could strengthen the hand of repressive governments. Between governments and social media have an interest in rights. So, governments should guarantee free speech. But, We also should learn how to use internet. We must be careful, don't leak of information. Having done that I think we don't need the right to be forgotten."
NBE03346,"I disagree with your opinion because I think privacy have priority over the right of expression when restrict to the range of individual. Media sometimes exaggerate the fact in order to make viewer interested, however, it will sometimes make the people who was carried on article or on the Internet sad. Thus, I disagree with your opinion."
NBE03319,"On one hand I can understand his statement, but on the other hand, I cannot agree with his whole thought. It is important to discriminate what is important information from what isn't. But it is so difficult . And information on Internet is imperishable, that is, once information is uploaded someone can theoretically hold it forever . And if ""the right to be forgotten""were more respected than ""the right to know"", the role of mass media would be reduced. So I think ""The right to be forgotten""should not be respected than ""the right to know"""
NBE03307,"When I read this article, I think privacy's right should be protected. This is most important thing of all things. we should spread it more and more."
NBE03341,"I approve of ""right to be forgotten"" It is not easy to eliminate the information up loaded on the Internet now when SNS, such as Facebook and Twitter, spread. The information is misused easily. when we use the Internet, we always have to take care. we need to be too careful of using Internet ."
NBE03310,"I feel this article tells us how to use the Internet rightly and effectively. The number of people who can use the Internet is increasing rapidly. If the growth goes on like this, the world would be united because the Internet can help us to communicate with a lot of people all over the world. Sometimes we see some news that tell us incidents by using the Internet in a bad way, however, like this case in the article, if we use the Internet in a right way, the world would be better."
NBE03283,"I disagree with this opinion. Surely, It is important that people should have their own privacy, but we want to know a lot of information by using Internet. If Google limited searching Internet, we could not access correct information, but particularly information chosen by the search giant."
NBE06093,"I use Internet every day and contribute everyday event on many SNS, so many people see my remark. It is very dangerous because people can know that my personal information. However my friends use SNS and contribute my picture and everyday event on SNS if I don't use SNS. It means I cannot my personal information by myself. I think that it should allow everybody to control the information."
NBE05889,"This is not a problem of one country but that of all over the world, so I think that we need some deep contacts between those countries to deal with the problem over the border, maintaining the respects for the right of each countries."
NBE05859,"With development of modern information technology, the amount of information around us becoming larger and larger these days. In this circumstance, how to protect individual privacy rights is an important problem. Once personal information is leaked out, it is almost impossible to ""be forgotten"" without help of government or company. Regulatory laws are needed. If the problem of personal rights is treated lightly, internet or other social networks will stop developing in the long run because it is supported by many many individuals."
NBE06691,"It's very important rights to forget, I want to say ""the rights not to forget"" is also important. In internet era, may storage services are launched, many of them are unreliable to run their service in long years. So I want them to assure of keeping our data, and if the service turn off, give our data in hard memory or carry on into another service."
NBE07214,"I'm very curious about the sphere of right to know and freedom of expression. So, this judicial precedent is helpful to me to think about such regal problems. I think that this judgment is correct, otherwise there is no privacy on the earth. However, it is fact that Google has some plausible reasons to insist on their validity. Today topics like this are very hot. So I think more and more people should have interest in their rights."
NBE05141,"In my opinion, to protect individual privacy is very difficult and to invade privacy makes us uncomfortable. Because now, in our society, there are a lot of individual information. People can easily access those information. I think privacy right is more important than the right to know. Therefore we should focus on protecting privacy."
NBE05801,I think we should be able to use the right to be forgotten because everybody has their past that he or she doesn't want anyone to know. We may make mistakes sometimes and we regret about that. But those facts don't need to be known after the years.
NBE05621,"I think the ""right to be forgotten"" is necessary for our information society, but considering the influence of our contribution before we contribute it is more important. Now the internet becomes close for everyone and privacy is a very important problem. For example, people can contribute their pictures with the information of the places those pictures were taken though they don't notice that. That information can lead to criminal if they are used in bad way. In addition, young people often contribute pictures with their sweetheart or comments about them, but the trace is left for a long time on the Internet after they are separated. We should take it more seriously when we contribute something private."
NBE05492,"The Internet is very useful but very dangerous. Once you post your pictures or status, even you set your privacy, every one can see your private. When we use Social Network Service, you should understand it."
NBE03357,"When I read this article, I was shocked to know labors' unfortunate circumstances. I think that the corporation should give them the treatments with human dignity. The company close their eyes to labors' suffering in order to make much profit. In a capitalistic country, you may seek profit. However, treating labors as animals is inadmissible. The government has to enact laws which protect the human rights of labors. Employers always want to exploit workers for inadequate pay as far as the law permits."
NBE03365,"I was very surprised that slave labor is still happening. Indeed, there were black slaves previously the 1960s, and owners had produced a product by activating the slaves human trafficked in human beings. However, it should have banned that the slavery all over the world the present day. This practice will deprive of human rights. Why can they do easily an outrage action like this. I can understand that they want to get a lot of profit in production and exports , but it is incorrect to enslave workers in order that. I think that they should review the production process properly."
NBE03360,"This article said that employment relationships (in all over the world) are very severe. I think this problem is happened in Japan too. To solve this problem, I think country's government should make laws about employment. Probably there are laws about it, but it isn't sufficient to protect labors. So I think government should strengthen the laws. For example, these days, there are problems about overtime work. So, how about regulate working time strictly, or pay for overtime work appropriately."
NBE03389,"Reading this article, I felt ""How terrible and appalling situation this is!"" This is definitely exploitation. Of course I can understand that underpaid laborers are needed in terms of cost reduction, but I presume that fundamental human right should be respected at the same time. Human beings are different from animals in that they can think logically and speak language . If we third person continually connive at this situation , it isn't too much to say that we let the laborers die. It's not humanitarian. So we should take measure for this situation."
NBE03361,"When I read this article, I was really shocked and surprised. Although I learned about the hard situation about shrimp industry, however, that's main point was environmental issue about mangrove so I didn't have enough knowledge about workers. Therefore, I think this time was very valuable because I came to know that how terrible their situation is ! Shrimp is my favorite food but I don't want them to work so hard and I think we all have to think this problem as very serious and find the way to improve their lives. If such problem about food is going to be more and more worse, then we cannot live in the same way as now. For example, consumers try not to buy so many shrimps then there will be less need for slave workers to work too hard. It is the most important for everyone in the world to live ""their"" lives."
NBE03414,"I was shocked to read this article for the first time because I probably eat prawns, shrimp and other foods which are produced in the situation like this everyday not knowing about slave labor. Many businesses, not only them of foods but also them of other industries, have been becoming multinational corporations to seek the economical labor force. They build many factories in countries whose standard of wages is low. However, I think they must consider the situation of labor and mustn't forget that labors are human beings. Wherever they work in, their human rights have to be secured."
NBE03351,"We should have a query about cheaper imports. There are cheaper labors behind cheaper imports. It develops a strong tendency to use cheap labor with the progress of globalization. Ideally, we consume local production. Now, we have an indirect hand in using slave labors. I'll take quality over quantity. We stop depending on overseas cheaper labors."
NBE03382,"On the morning of the day I have read this article, I ate the shrimps which my family had bought in COSTCO. So, when I read this article, I was surprised, and I felt that I have a close relation to this news. I was shocked at still using people like slave. I didn't know the back ground of the shrimps I always eat are such a cruel systems. The company of shrimp must abolish this system of slave labor immediately. If many men are handled of slave, I don't want to eat the shrimps and I would not like buy other shrimps. I think, many companies are thinking methods for how to sell cheap shrimp, how to sell a lot of shrimp from other companies. But that methods of using slave labor are wrong. For stopping the system, consumers don't buy such shrimps. I think that gives the most damage for the company, it would be effective, however, being realization is so difficult . Because consumers have priority over not slave's problem but the price. I got the chance that I heard the problem, so I should tell the fact for many people. Because, the foods we eat have a relation to slave labor's problem. Many people know this fact is important at first. Thinking of Governments, they can prohibit the system of slave labor, and they don't permit to sell such a shrimp. Moreover they decide the lowest price, they don't compete with others for the cheapest prise, and they make a rule of labor>'s system, and condition , saving the people like slave. I suppose these are tied with saving the slave laborers."
NBE03381,"When I read this article, I was shocked and astonished very much. I did not know about this at all although I often eat shrimp which are imported from those countries. I felt myself shameful and remorse for those countries' people. In these days, it seems that there is a society without no discrimination for gender and ethnic group. But I do not think so definitely. I feel there is clearly racial and sex discrimination in the world. Once I visited abroad, I felt discrimination for me as Asian people. One shopkeeper recommended tasting service for Caucasians who are in the line before me. On the other hand, the shopkeeper did not recommend the same thing for our family and the other Asian people who are in the line behind us. I felt very sad and understood this is the reality. In addition to this, I feel sex discrimination definitely. I joined to the extracurricular club whose ratio of boys and girls is 5 to 1. Naturally men are given priority and girls cannot be understood about girls' own troubles and there are almost no considerations for girls. There are still clear discriminations in the world and we must abolish the system as soon as possible."
NBE03394,"When I read this article, I got surprised at using slave labor to make shrimps. If we eat that shrimp , we will be buying produce of slave labor. That means we agree with slavery. That is probably reluctant for us. Moreover it is unethical to use them because they pay no attention to their human rights. So I would like to suggest that Japanese government should stop importing that shrimp and also make that shrimp industry give up using slave labor."
NBE03377,"This article surprised me very much. I have learned the bad conditions of farmers such as coffee and cacao. However, I didn't know the fact of shrimp. This problem should be resolved as soon as possible. But it is very difficult. We, consumers, want to buy the cheaper product. So farmers and corporations must make an effort to make their products cheaper. They can't stop using slaves. Thus we are involved in the problem. We should know it and change our action."
NBE03412,"When I read this article, I was very shocked at slave labor being used in the sever condition. Although I know there are discrimination in the world, I didn't think such a terrible situation. It will be difficult Japan stop importing shrimp from their countrys, so the government should make regulations which protect human rights and control the company strictly."
NBE03370,"When I read this article, I was surprised and frightened at the circumstance of slave labor in shrimp industry in Thailand. Why are there such captive laborers? Why are they sold like animals and are forced into unfair labor? Which should we respect as human beings, them or shrimp? Then, I questioned media response to the reality in Japan. This news should be known all over the world. I hope the day they can work in appropriate condition as human beings will come."
NBE03373,"When I read this article, I was really surprised. I didn't know the fact that the fishmeal suppliers use slave labor. Using slave labor should not be permitted. We must respect each other's human rights. We have to do something to get the fishmeal suppliers to stop using slave labor. I think the best way to get them to stop using slave labor is that government enact a law about working condition, and regulate working condition. I hope that slave labor will disappear from this world."
NBE03399,"When I read this article, I was so surprised to the fact that slave laborers are killed. And then, I remembered the TV program I watched last year. The program was about children's laborers in India. In developing countries, companies need make things cheap and make much profit. They use slaves to pay cut. However, the fact isn't known to us, who buy their goods. We should know more about these present circumstances."
NBE03400,"When I read this article, I think this is very hurtful news and I was shocked. I've never know that they are working very so hard. They are working like slaves to make shrimps which we will eat. I think it should be changed. I think the company should care about our human right. We should abolish this working system now."
NBE03358,"It is the main problem in this article that is the fact that the world STILL allows people to use slave labor. Slave labor should have been eliminated, but is still. Using slave labor has many problems that people who are limited to work have no rights, aren't paid properly, etc. In modern world it is natural for people to be free. But we think it too natural. Therefore, we don't have intension to see the world. The world is still irrational, so if we intend to see the world situation, we don't notice the world's irrationality. In this article, examples include Shrimp Industry, but in others situations there are slave labor problems. And we should intend to understand the problems."
NBE03363,"I was surprised at the fact that there is still slave labor now. Speaking of slave labor, most of us image African slave. It was an injustice one and banned 19th century. I learned such history, so I thought all slaves completely disappeared. In this situation, developed countries should do something. For example, we should indicate an error of this system and should not buy shrimps from Thailand. There are many other solution strategies, but the most important thing is getting rid of slaves completely."
NBE03393,"When I read this news, I was surprised at using slave labors in shrimp industry. It is natural that some companies want to sell at a price cheaper than other companies. However, we must not use slave labor at any time. I think what kind of person should be treated as a person. This is because that anyone in the world have the human rights. I think that Japanese media did not response this news quickly, because they think the news will have any effect on consumers buying shrimp. I hope that the day when all people can live in equality comes."
NBE03391,"When I read this article, I was surprised and become sad. I didn't know that they were in such a situation. The slave is the system that there must not be. You must think that we cooperate and defeat such situation. The media should react to such situation as one means. If repeat a steady thing, change the situation; will help it. I think that it is important that it continues and acts."
NBE03362,"From this article, we can learn two things. First, there is the fact that our lives are supported by others. Although this is the extreme case, there is a lot of others' sacrifice. We must realize that how a lot of benefit we owe others. Second, we recognize the system of slave labor. Let me assure you that nobody like cheap products. So, although we think that we shouldn't have slave labor, few of us take actions. So we should take action to cut down the number of the slave labor."
NBE03372,"I was shocked to read this news. I have not known how shrimps which are sold in supermarkets are produced. There are many slave labors who are treated as animal in shrimp industry. This problem is related to Japanese because we buy prawns or shrimps at SEIYU or other supermarkets. In Japan, however, few people know this fact. I think we should become aware of this problem. We just can do is taking action to protect slave labor's right. I hope the shrimp industry produce foods without using slave labors."
NBE03396,"It was quite shocking to see that there are still slavery remaining to this day. I knew that slavery existed during the Civil War, but I never knew that slavery existed in the 21st century. Slavery violates human rights in every way, and there should be severe punishment to slave owners. It is also disgusting to know that the shrimp and prawns from Thailand set on supermarkets are the ""produce of slavery. "" Since this concerns not only Thailand, but the countries around Thailand, we should figure out a way to stop slavery and save these people on board."
NBE03411,"I was so surprised at the news that some of our daily food is based on slave labor and shocked how terrible the present situation of slave labor is. I suggest that we, that is , the consumer refuse to buy the commodity of company which handle slaves terribly for their interest."
NBE03386,"The truth that shrimps which we unintentionally eat in daily life is raised by large numbers of men bought and sold like animals and held against their will on fishing boats surprised me. Especially I was shocked at the severe working conditions that can lead labors to death. I can't believe such a thing is possible in this modern society. Since we consumers eat cultured shrimps, we have to consider the workers who are related the process and choose the one which the workers are concerned."
NBE03410,"I have thought that there are no slavery today, so I was shocked when I read this article. Not only me , almost everyone think there are no slavery today, I suppose. There are a lot of serious problems , for example, environmental problem, a food shortage , and poverty. That's why we miss the problem of slavery. I think everyone have equal right , so employers have to pay fair wage to them. We should make efforts to look at problem hidden by main serious problem."
NBE03356,"I hadn't been imagined that many slaves worked to get fishmeals in horrific situation until I read this article. This fact should be known for Japanese people, because imported foods are related with our life. To solve this problem, governments should make international regulation which prohibits sell food products which use slave labor. Also consumers should research details of products, for example, price, place of origin."
NBE03380,"I have already known that there are some suppliers that use slave labor. However I thought they are minority, and most of suppliers are not using, so the news about CP foods, the world's largest shrimp farmer, surprised me. I mustn't buy things from bad suppliers like CP foods to protect people from the labor in horrific conditions."
NBE03379,"When I read this article, I think it is cruel that supplier use slave labors. They treats labors as animal. If they does this in Japan, they must be charged. We are part of the world and we are friends, so we should think this problem as our friend's problem. Human rights should be respected all over the world. I think slave system must be abolished."
NBE03413,"Consumers have to understand that we may have participated in forced labor indirectly, and have to take action. This news that the food eating every day might be morally made by the bad method made consumers anxiety and grief . At the result, sales of related goods decreased . However, it will not become solution only by economic sanctions and refrain buying. It is necessary to make laws that indicate the rule of the process until food reaches consumers."
NBE03408,"I was very surprised to read this article. I often eat shrimps. But, I did not know that such a terrible thing was taking place in the process that made the shrimps. I cannot understand the sense of people employing the same human being as a slave. I hope that such situation is improved as soon as possible."
NBE03407,"I was very surprised to read this article. I often eat shrimps. But, I did not know that such a terrible thing was taking place in the process that made the shrimps. I cannot understand the sense of people employing the same human being as a slave. Even if they want work force, I think that it is wrong to treat a human being like an animal. If an individual less thinks about human rights, we cannot anticipate the improvement of the situation, but I hope that such situation is improved as soon as possible."
NBE03402,"I think slave labor are used not only in shrimp industry but in various industries. I have seen the documentary video about Indian child labor in factories and mines. It is very very serious problem and we must consider the laws and projects that prohibit these unethical labor. The most effective actions about unethical labor is to buy only fair trade goods and not to buy tremendously cheap goods in supermarkets. However most people think it is impossible. Therefore I think it is the important first step to attract the interest of lots of people about these unethical labor. Improving labor environment will take a long time, but we must change these cruel situation."
NBE03378,"I can't believe even in the modern world, some people were forced to work and not paid like slaves. According to the article, workers are treated like animals in their terrible work environment. It is true. We should face up to reality. However, Japanese government or companies would not wrestle with the problem actively. That's because Seafood consumption in Japan depends on imports from south east Asia. Perhaps such forced labor would contribute to cheap price in Japan, which makes us happy. Before we claim the human rights and dignity, we should reconsider our attitude."
NBE03392,This article will shock the world. We should criticize such an inhumane working. I warn Thailand government to research about this issue and They must force CP foods to close the factory.
NBE03404,"If you buy prawns or shrimp from Thailand, you will be buying the produce of slave labor, this word was very impressive for me. We are apt to buy cheep goods without thinking anything, but retailers may use forced labor like this news. To solve this problem, watch agency should be in place in an appropriate manner in all labor market. And we should continue investigation whether supermarkets use slave labor. I hope that terrible things will disappear from all over the world."
NBE03398,"I was surprised and shocked at labor using slaves is still being. In developing country, they want to cut costs as possible as they can. So, they uses slaves. We should stop to import shrimps from their country but we can't because of shrimp demand. The only thing we can do is we know more about such a circumstance and thanks for the food."
NBE03387,"Reading this article, I remembered the story of ""The Cannery Boat (KANIKOSEN)"", which is about people forced to work like slaves. I was surprised to see that such painful situations still exist today. I felt angry at old-fashioned way of capitalists' treating workers. In the flaw of globalization, we should respect and consider them, which is the contemporary way of working."
NBE03376,"When I read this article , I was shocked and surprised at using slave labor. Although I often eat shrimps, I didn't know such a terrible thing. To solve this problem, we should make a law about prohibiting such a terrible thing. And I hope that such a terrible thing disappear from this world!"
NBE03352,"When I read this article, I think there was something similar to what happened to current Thailand in Japan. That is the yarn-making factories which was privately-owned in the Meiji era. From the view point of modern people, there seemed to be extremely oppressive work and exploitation in the factories which were pursuing the biggest benefit. It is said that the daughters who was born into country cropper family were delivered to the yarn-making factories. We should deeply think about the work of international migrant workers."
NBE03409,"In Japan, we can't see slavery labor, but in fact today there is this labor. This labor should be banned. It will kill more and more people. So it should be restrained."
NBE03388,"In this news, there are still slave labor in shrimp industry. And the global retailers like Seiyu sells us a lot of shrimps that they bought from CP foods. And CP foods were supplied by shrimp industry using slave labor. US and UK responded this terrible fact quickly. But their medias were anxious about their effect on consumers buying shrimp. So they remained to be seen this. When I read this article, I was very surprised and thought, ""I can't believe slave labor still exists !"". But in our living cities, many things are sold for unbelievable low prices. We should feel something is wrong when we buy them. But I guess many people don't even know this fact. So I think it is important for saving people who work slavery to know tis fact."
NBE03405,i am very surprised at this news. i like shrimp . so i should think this news very much.
NBE03359,"I have known a little about slave labor but I didn't know so cruel like that. This industrial system is profitable only for developed countries and ignore the human right of people in developing countries. And those who buy the products from the suppliers using slave labor are accomplices. It is the industry that makes all the people who are relevant to that happy, so we must consider how to solve this problem hard and as soon as possible."
NBE03395,"When I looked this news, I was surprised very much that such a thing still happened. This is because, though movement to get rid of slavery is taking place all over the world, it really existed. I think that it is wrong to make a person unhappy only for the thought that they want to be cheaper. I think that Many people eat sold prawns without knowing this fact I think that it is important that even slightly many people know this fact to solve this problem even a little."
NBE03354,"This article serves us one thing that advanced countries must not look away from realities of developing countries. We may eat shrimps which this article says. developed countries have large amount of money, but developing countries don't have enough. However, developed countries should not squeeze as small money as possible from developing countries. I think that advanced countries would rather improve state of developing countries."
NBE03369,This article said that employment relationships all over the world are very serious. I think the problem also is occurred in Japan . I think there are two solutions about this problem. The first is that the government should make laws strict which are related to employment. Probably. the current laws are not sufficient to protect labors. So I think government should strengthen the laws. The second is that each person should know the current situation.
NBE03371,"I was so shocked at this story. if I were a slave labor and forced to work 18 to 20 hours per day for seven days a week , I would dead soon. I wander that the world has another lot of slave labors and they work very very hard today so I want to buy fear trade products when I go shopping."
NBE03366,I feel sad that there still exist such a things like slavery and human trafficking. We should not allow those inhuman acts and take an active part in trying to abolish those things.
NBE03397,"I was shocked at the circumstance of slave labor in shrimp industry in Thailand. Also, I don't know that these terrible situation still have existed. The slaves are as same as women like us, but their lives are so far from ours. I can't ignore the serious fact. However, ironically, there may be possible of our eating food which is produced by them. We are also the parties concerned. We should be aware of it and reconsider the solution."
NBE03415,I'm so sad and angry with there still being customs of people treated as slaves. It is impermissible. We should behave to abolish this bad custom.
NBE03384,"I agree with him. actually, some Japanese labors are in same environment called black company. we should take action to protect human rights."
NBE03385,"we should treat people as slavery. in fact , we Japanese eat shrimp a lot. but not so many people don't know what happens while shrimp are made."
NBE03390,"Developed countries including Japan have responsibility for this situation. They desire cheap cost , so developing countries have no choice but to cut labor costs. I think developed countries must pay appropriate wages and make the circumstance that nobody is slave labor."
NBE03401,"I agree with your thought. When we buy cheaper goods we should never forget the existence of cheaper labors. In addition, we should have the awareness that it depends on our decisions whether cheaper labors conditions will be improved or not."
NBE03406,"I am against a part of your opinion. It is true that we have an indirect hand in using slave labors. Of course, when we consider human rights, this is not necessarily a good thing. However, i think we have to have an efficient production method to sustain a population of 100 million. The too terrible labor circumstances should be prohibited, but a constant such work force may be necessary."
NBE03353,"I think labor like slavery should be prohibited in this 21st century. And I think Japan can take an important part of improvement of this situation. As a same Asian country, first we should buy a lot of goods like shrimps. It is seen as having the opposite effect. But without enough monetary base, the capitalism do not work perfectly and the cannot mend the working environment. Second, Japanese industries should advance to Thailand. Because Japanese company do not break rules about labor. The better working environment is with enough payment, holiday, social welfare service Thai. So they can export it to Thai. Japan and Thailand have a common about customs, Imperial(Royal) house, Buddhism strict manners. I think the relationship between Japan and Thai is the key to solve the problem."
NBE03374,"I agree with you, To solve this problem, we should make a law about prohibiting such a terrible thing. And I hope that such a terrible thing disappear from this world!"
NBE03375,I agree with you. some Japanese labors are in same environment called black company They are same as slavery labor.
NBE03364,I was so shocked from this news because I can not believe there are still people treated like slave . We should save them .
NBE03368,"Using slave to make a profit is serious problem especially in poor countries. By helping these countries, we can tackle this problem."
NBE03403,"This is because I also think we have to take legal action against slave labor. Some of the countries think establishing laws which restrict economic business activity is not good. However, until making laws which fixes the standard of labor condition, we cannot banish products made by slave labor."
NBE03383,"I didn't know the news too. And I agree with your idea that taking action to protect slave right, but it is difficult problem to solve it. We can spread the news and fact to many people for slave labor."
NBE03416,"My opinion is condensed into this classmate's comment! Slave system must not exist. We should cooperate to defeat this situation. I feel sad because slave system still exists. I felt slave system is not history, but ongoing problem after reading this article and comment."
NBE03367,"I don't believe that the slave labor should remain. When you buy a merchandise that is produced using slaves, you should think that you are the one who is making the slaves' life harder. People still should buy goods that are produced in a proper way, even though they might be more expensive."
NBE03355,"I agree with his (or her) opinions. Slaves to be prohibited strongly, it is not allowed. His opinion is very natural. For human beings, human rights is very important thing. However, It is no doubt that the presence of slavery is a big problem. The pursuit of profit could lead taking away the right to be protected. This problem should be solved on a global basis. Even if we buy something at the supermarket, it may be involved in this issue. We, rich people, may encourage slavery."
NBE06629,I agree with your thinking. We should consider that there are many people who is labored in cheap salary when we buy cheap clothes which made in Southeast Asia.
NBE05164,"I didn't know that slaves are being traded even now. Also, I was surprised that it occurred behind food market. I felt that we must know the fact and think about the meaning of eating. Eating is a natural thing for us but we should feel the happiness of being able to eat. In addition, When I eat shrimp from Thailand next time, I probably can't help remember the slaves. I don't want to buy the shrimps. I will check the producing area and buy right shrimps not wrong ones. I hope that it will connect the reducing of slavery."
NBE07025,"I was shocked and surprised by this news. If we've eaten the shrimp, not only I but all around people contribute to slave labor. We should tackle this serious problem."
NBE06321,"I didn't know shrimps had such a big problem. I usually eat seafoods without thinking who made them and how they were delivered. Today, there is a large gap between developed and developing countries. But I haven't paid attention to this in daily life. People in developing countries work from"
NBE06322,"I didn't know shrimps had such a big problem. I usually eat sea foods without thinking who made them and how they were delivered. Today, there is a large gap between developed and developing countries. But I haven't paid attention to this in daily life. People in developing countries work from day to night. However, they are poor. It's because large companies exploit their profit. I've realized I'm responsible for this reality. I'm a member exploiters. What can I do? I'm going to begin paying attentions to the facts by reading newspapers and checking news. Then, I find out the resources of problem and make solutions!!!!!!!!!!"
NBE06094,"I was very shocked when I read this article. I eat various food everyday, but I do not know those food where was produced. Japan has low food self-sufficiency ratio, so a lot of foods are produced in foreign countries. In foreign countries, there is a possibility that using slaves when produce food. There is a possibility that it's tied with slavery abolition we check producer when we buy it. I strongly believe that slavery system should be abolished. I want this news to spread and everyone think about slave system. People should think about solution of slave system."
NBE06171,Many low price foods which we always eat often have some problems. This case is labor problem. There are such problems in other food. People in advanced nations know this fact but they can't eat shrimp absolutely. The action that they do is to criticize shrimp industry which supply shrimp to advanced nations.
NBE06172,We are responsible to this fact. Shrimp industry did such a thing because people want cheap shrimps. So we should consider this matter as deep as shrimp industry.
NBE05493,"It is illegal to take people as an animal. By the way, when we eat food from animals, we have to take into account people who kill them to make delicious food from them."
NBE06959,"I was very surprised and shocked to learn the fact that slave labor still continues in the world. I can understand they need many workers for shrimp industry. However, they have human rights, and it must be respected at the same time. We should not overlook this situation. How can we solve this problem? It is very difficult to answer. I think the government should take another look at their law. Law should defend the people who citizens of the nation, of course workers. So I want law controls about working to be strongest"
NBE06958,"I agree with your opinion that we eat various food everyday, but we do not know those food where was produced. Things we eat every day have close connection with our health, so I think we should be more interested in that. I also agree with your opinion that you want this news to spread and everyone think about slave system. Workers have human rights, of course. Therefore it must be respected. We should discuss this problem deeply and quickly."
NBE03439,"I was shocked when I hear the news. I think it is unbelievable that crews run away striving to be first. But the crews of the ferry did as such. The company has neglected the safety. They haven't acted with a sense of responsibility. Today companies struggle with trying to reduce costs. It is necessary. However, they should consider consumers' safety and benefit. I want to say that to companies, especially one in food industry. I aspire a thorough investigation. I want for companies to prevent a recurrence with a clear description of the cause and responsibility."
NBE03477,"According to this article, 15 crews insisted that they were not responsible for the Sewol sinking and a ferry operator's chief executive and four employees also didn't admit that it caused this accident that the ferry was overloaded with cargo and had been redesigned. I was amazed by it. After weighing economic growth and the passengers' safety, Chonghaejin Marine chose the former. They cut down the things that never be cut down anyway. And the explanation that crews didn't know that the ferry was overloaded with cargo and had been redesigned is very childish. This is not a matter that can be settled with it. I think they must face the grieving families and consider what they did."
NBE03425,"When I read articles about South Korean ferry first, I think that ferry's captain has no sense of responsibility. It is because the captain didn't rescue his passengers but jump into rescue boat first. This is unbelievable accident. In this article, I found that Nam Ho-Man has no sense of responsibility too. He headed Chonghaejin's cargo team. However he didn't know the ferry's cargo limit and how match cargo was loaded on the day of the accident. I think the man who head a company or team must know rules and do one's duty. So I think companies have to adhere rigidly to the rules not to cause same mistake."
NBE03455,"I was not able to understand the thing in detail because of a surprise at that time. It is what is not permitted that the accident happened because they piled it up more than quantity of the freight which they can load onto a ship. Since this news was to have been generated in a country next to Japan, it was big reported in Japan. Of them following the fact that did it, must reflect in various scenes. @@I think that it was good that I can learn it about this news."
NBE03476,"CEO should receive the punishment more than the crew of Korean sinking ferry. In the beginning It was thought that the accident occurred because the crew ignored the passenger. It became clear that not only neither a captain but also a crew is bad. The cause of an accident is the design which disregarded safety. The CEO's lawyer insists that they are not teaching that crew put a over wight load . However, it is only going to escape responsibility. As a result of continuing to seek profits, they have caused such an accident. Therefore, they should receive severe punishment."
NBE03463,"I was not able to understand what they were saying. I think they don't feel responsibility for this accident at all. For example, the captain left the vessel and jumped to the rescue boat first without rescuing passengers. And he is also Defendant Nam Ho-Man, who headed Chonghaejin's did not know the ferry's cargo limit and did not know how much cargo was loaded on the day of the accident. These mistakes was not happen if they employees know duties. In this case, it is natural that crews give highest priority to the safety of human lives. I learned from this South Korean ferry accident, on working, it is very important that understand duties what we have to do even if how natural it is."
NBE03427,"In my opinion , it is quite natural that the CEO was blamed for the accident. Although many of us criticize only the captain of ferry , I think we should criticize the CEO at the same time. The CEO have a responsibility of teaching their employees and should take action what their company did. I'm sorry for family of victims , however, I think this is good time for other company CEO to look back their responsibility."
NBE03452,"Reading this article, I was very shocked and was disgusted with the captain of the ship and its crews. They abstain the responsibility of their work. On one hand , I can understand their thoughts and their statements, that is, ""I want to live!"";on the other hand I hold them in contempt. In my opinion, this is obviously a consequence of human neglect. So , they should be strictly punished."
NBE03473,"When I knew about this incident at the first time, I was seething at the ferry's captain. However I noticed that I hadn't have understood truth when I read this article. The prosecutors unveiled that the company officials neglected the safety of the passengers and take priority to the profit of the company. I was very surprised at the fact that the mass media changes our thoughts and feelings easily. I feel grief for the victims of this accident and I learned the power of the mass media from this news."
NBE03442,"If the reason for the sinking is the ferry's cargo, it's true that staffs escaped with leaving a number of people. They are clearly responsible for the disaster. I was surprised at knowing that there are some people who are still missing. I hope they will be found as early as possible."
NBE03468,"It shows how employee's training is important. For Sewol crew, they have no choice but to deny their responsibilities. This is because Sewol crew had not received enough rescue and ethical training. When the accident ocu Some of you think my thought is wrong."
NBE03467,"This article shows how employee's training is important. For Sewol crew, they have no choice but to deny their responsibilities. This is because Sewol crew had not received enough rescue and ethical training. Therefore, they had not had the awareness that they were employees and they were responsible for passengers. When the accident happened, they had not known what they should do. They acted as passengers. Some of you think my thought is wrong. somebody think they could serve right action even they had not been taught enough. However, if ever once you have worked, I think you know how it is hard difficult to take responsibility for your job. Ever university students jobs have heavy responsibilities. much more their job has tremendously heavy responsibilities. I think this is not the ferry company and South Korean societies problem, but also the whole world's problem. To gain more economic profits, many company have been run illegally. We should pay more attention to these illegal managements."
NBE03474,"I think the lack of responsibility of crew member who carry a lot of people's lives should improve in order not to cause such tragedy. I hope the wreck will be the cornerstone of the consciousness of crew's pride, responsibility."
NBE03458,"I think this accident was caused by lack of responsibility of the leader. Besides, it gave the people in the world fear of vehicle. I think it is not only problem of Korean companies. We, people all over the world need to understand the cause of the accident and consider a solution of such an accident. It is most important for us to understand the cause of an accident when an accident occurred. I hope such an accident do not happened any more."
NBE03460,"To see this news that caused the dead person of approximately 300, as for me, I can't believe irresponsibility of the CEO at the same time as a heart ached. At first I think that caused this accident is to have been beyond the freight limit of the ferry. In spite of it, I think that they who got away with leaving a passenger when they caused an accident are responsible for the doubles. When many people see this news, I think that they grieved, but think that, with that in mind, it is necessary to understand the importance of the responsibility of the leader all over the world."
NBE03426,"According to this article, a ferry operator's chief executive and four employees was at the helm of the vessel when it capsized. When I read this news, the most surprising fact for me was that the vessel was overloaded with poorly stowed cargo after a risky redesign and safety was neglected as next to nothing was spent on crew training. Should we think that benefit is more important than safety? I think the answer is ""No. "" Recently, there may be a lot of companies that pay more attention to making much money, however, they should learn form this disaster and try not to happen such accident again. In this news, we could learn the fact that the crew members, including the captain, said through their lawyers that their employer was responsible for the ship's sinking because sailors had no control over cargo and they said the coast guard was responsible for rescuing the passengers. This made me shocked very much because I think what they should do was not blame other people but apologize to the grieving families. Also, South Korean government have to make more strict laws about safety."
NBE03422,"I think that this accident concerns us, too. In a capitalistic nation, we seek profit. However, we should not neglect the safety. The vessel was overloaded with poorly stowed cargo. The crews should have informed the media on the fact that the company sought profit at the sacrifice of the passengers' lives. Therefore, the crews should be punished. Furthermore, CEO is a person most responsible for this accident in this company. He should have made efforts to know what was happening in his company. He should be accused of a serious crime. There is no doubt that we should learn precious teachings by this accident. ""Life is more important than money. """
NBE03437,"When I read this news two months ago, I thought the captain was the most irresponsible. However, after reading this article, I thought the CEO was most irresponsible. If the CEO fulfilled his task and noticed careless mistakes, this accident never happened. The CEO must not seek profit but provide people with safety. The chance of accident, all company's CEO should take responsibility and should not take mistakes. I hope such accident never happen from now on."
NBE03464,"I was shocked that the vessel made in Japan is converted to make more profit in Korea, and that CEO, the captain and employees are all irresponsible for what they did. I'm sympathize with families whose member died in the accident because who is responsible for this accident isn't clear, so they can't vent their sorrow on anybody."
NBE03444,"I was surprised and got angry about two point. The first is the company knew the ship's redesign made top-heavy and unstable. And they spent only $2 on training for any emergency . However luxurious or comfortable the ship is, human life and safety should have priority over all other things. And it is important that they make a profit, but if they do a sly trick , they lose their trust . After that , many people don't want to use it. People seek safety, as they use means of transportation. The second that I paid attention to these lawyer's comment. When I read these sentences , I think we should not seek who have responsibility for this trouble, but should look for what is the cause that the trouble happened. And the company must understand the cause in order to improve bad points. When any trouble like that occurred, all companies don't think someone else's business. They should think and reconsider each company , as if it had happened to them. If so, many troubles can be defended, before occurred."
NBE03471,"This news makes me feel sad even if I look how many times. According to this article, it is said that the cause that the ship sank into was result of an excessive cargo. I think that they should be punished immediately because they ignore the passenger, and they escaped even if it was not the crew to have piled up loads. What I was surprised at very much when I read this article was that the ferry company downplayed the security of the passenger, and gave priority to the economic profit of the company. I looked at the state that families of the dead grieved in TV and came to have a pain in my chest. Moreover, I felt anger for the company. I hope that such a case never happens."
NBE03421,"I was very surprised at many ferries were redesigned to add cabins and created an exhibition room after its purchase. Not only that, Chonghaejin Marine connivanced it and have continued to overload the ferry. Furthermore, I felt fury because 15 crew members laid blame on others. It is important to make regulation which prohibit overloading ferries and strengthen sailors' emergency training. We mustn't repeat such disaster which many people grieve."
NBE03431,I feel sorry for this tragic accident because I personally think that it was not a unavoidable accident and it is safe to say that it was a man-made disaster. Public transportation or other means of transportations are absolutely responsible for the lives of the people. They should take as much care as they can to save those lives.
NBE03466,"When I see this news, I felt anger. Not only the captain abdicated all responsibility but also they piled a lot of cargo that are overloaded. I think this accident was caused by lack of responsibility of the leader. I think it is natural things that crews give us highest priority to the safety of human lives. From this article, I learned we should be think responsibility which we have."
NBE03447,"Reading this article, I realized that the captain was not the only one who was to blame. The accident was also caused by irresponsibility of the company he belonged to. The company as a whole, including him, should be denounced, And It is also natural that the prime minister Park is blamed for haphazard investigation. Although I was confused and felt indignant when I hear the news that the ferry capsized because of overloaded cargo, I now think that it is a bit consoling news to the grieving families that so far 292 passengers have been recovered (as ""bodies"", though)."
NBE03446,"I think that this is the responsibility of the CEO, of course. And the truth that the CEO does not really have a sense of responsibility to have escaped makes me feel deplorable. Not only the CEO but also 14 crew members missed in a sense of responsibility too. It is a pity to become the social trend that such people increase to."
NBE03433,"I felt very sad when I read the news. Especially, I felt angry as if I was a relative of the victims. There are two causes of this sinking accident. The first is the crew's ruck of sense of crisis and the ruck of responsibility. Crew must never forget to take the life of the passengers and should have risk management capacity. The second is that laws do not be decided properly. The government make the law strict . So, we must not repeat such disaster."
NBE03475,"A government should impose a very strict penalty on the crew of sinking ferry. And I was surprised that weight of cargo caused this accident. If it's true, not only the crew but also designers have a grave mistake. I want to solve the cause of this accident."
NBE03469,"What is the cause of the South Korea ferry accident? The answer of this is very various and all of the causes should be reconsidered. However, among them, I think, it is the lack of the sense of responsibilities of the company and the ferry crew that led such terrible accident. Certainly, it is natural that companies put emphasis on pursuing their profits and ferry crew member try to save their own lives, but they should have given the first priority to save their passenger. They need to take a look at what they did, , and other company all over the world should learn a lesson from this accident."
NBE03443,"This news that the Korean ferry had sank shocked me very much. It is because a lot of people died in the ferry , who are the same age like me. In addition to this, more shocking matter for me is that this accident was caused by human error. Firstly, the crews' ways of thinking about safety were optimistic. The captain of the ferry escaped firstly and the employees announced wrong information for long time. Of course, there were a few crews with virtuous hearts and they helped passengers at risk of their lives. But this accident was caused by the human error. Secondly, the government should have made more regulations for the safety. Korean government should have regulated the load capacity and manuals in an emergency. Because of lack of regulations, so many people who could have been saved died. We should make exertions to decrease such an accident by human error"
NBE03478,"When I read this article, I was afraid of the risk of accident of vehicle. Until now I never think about it, so this time is a nice opportunity to reconsider the blessing of my life. I think this accident is due to the lack of the sense of responsibilities of the company and the ferry crew."
NBE03462,"This accident have been asking us ""Where is responsibility?"" When I hear the news of the accident, I regarded being to blame as the chief of the ferry. However, I don't think so now. Not only the chief of the ferry, but also company he belonged to is responsible for this. It is true that everyone want to save their own lives in an emergency. However, I think there need to be more sense of responsibility of them. Considering these things, we must swear that we let the terrible accident like this never be occurred."
NBE03457,"This case is not an accident but a man-made disaster. A captain and crews should let passengers get out of the ferry. That is their job. However, They run away first because they wanted to survive. This is a most ungentlemanly act for them. I am very sorry for the victims and their family. The CEO must take responsibility. He should be executed."
NBE03470,"Hearing the news whose South Korean ship was depressed, I felt sad. You have taken refuge from the captain having made the passenger desertion. However, I will change a viewpoint. Should a wrecked ship be kept sunk? This has been a problem very much now. It is because the example where the wrecked ship became @@ of the fish and fish increased in number to keep a wrecked ship sunk was reported. Globally, the crop yields of a tuna increase and the tuna has been whether is exterminated at the problem. Therefore, can't the problem be solved depending on the method of processing of a wrecked ship, either? But there is also still a missing person in the sunken wrecked ship. Sadness of the bereaved family who lost the family is unfathomable. Therefore, it is also important to find out the dead family's dead body and article left behind. This news makes me consider various things."
NBE03445,"Grieving families still are frantic . They think that it is the captain of the vessel that is responsible for capsizing the vessel . I hear that some grieving families ask the crew to accept execution . I think it is not humane . It is important for the company of the ship to look into the incident initially and to retrieve the deads . And Korean government should make environment where unveiled investigation can be taken . Korean government has an effect on the end of the incident, I think ."
NBE03429,"This news made me feel sad because many people were killed by this disaster. Moreover, the captain of this ferry ran anyway when this accident happened. I was shocked to hear this fact."
NBE03461,"I believe that it is wrong in choosing economic benefits over risking important lives. The passengers who were mainly just high school students had their whole life ahead of them and because of the crew members personal economical needs, the students lives were lost. Also besides this problem, after the ship had started to sink, the Korean government should have taken quicker measures in dealing with this issue. If the government had taken faster actions in a more earlier stage, there would have been less deaths and more lives would have been saved."
NBE03424,"I think it is quite natural that parents of students who were killed in this accident be furious very much. Both parents and students are innocent and only crew, especially captain, is sinful. All of those who are relevant to this accident have to be punished strictly."
NBE03420,"I was very shocked to read this article. It is natural that people should demand vast amount in capitalist economy. But, this article seems to told us that demanding excessive profits led to the tragedy. These idea which represent in this capitalist economy deprived numerous life. I think companies which have people's lives in their hands should take the importance into consideration again not to repeat again."
NBE03430,"It's very shocking article for me. It is important that people want to choose economic benefits, but we have to consider the way not to harm human's living. The risking of human's living is very important for us, so we must not make some factors which cause such accidents. I think that companies need to carry on business while they pay attention the people's living."
NBE03440,"According to the article, the crews were not trained. When the ferry was not at the helm and sinking, the crews had no choice but to leave the ferry because of their inexperience. Everyone thinks this action are same as murder, and I think so too. They should be heavily criticized for leaving the ship while so many people still remained aboard. In addition, according to the article, the vessel was overloaded with poorly stowed cargo after a risky redesign and safety was neglected. If this are true, this tragedy is the very man-made rather than a natural disaster. It is no exaggeration to say that a faulty and sloppy management of safety led to the accident."
NBE03417,"Are companies allowed only to go after profits? The CEO focus on profits instead of safety. I'm disconsolate about this article. Company must place maximum priority on human life. In our normal life, we prefer to forget about attention on safety. Every business manager takes the opportunity afforded by this case to confirm safety."
NBE03428,"This accident made me angry. I think captain should do his work with a sense of mission and a high feeling of tension. Every passenger believe him, as it were, entrust their life to him. Even if this is an unexpected accident, the captain must not betray the passengers. Such an offender think just to apologize is enough, but this is totally wrong. I think they should consider how the victims feel."
NBE03435,"When I read this article, I had grief and fury at the same time. Particularly , I was very shocked at the topic of Chonghaejin. This case was not an unexpected accident. It was just waiting to happen. Thorough this case, I was terrified at human greed for wealth. Which did Chonghaejin executives value more, passenger's life? or fame and wealth? If it had been passenger's life , this case would haven't happened. I pray that their soul may rest in peace."
NBE03434,"I strongly agree with your opinion. If the reader had been responsible, this accident would haven't happened. I also want to think again what is responsibility."
NBE03465,I strongly agree with your opinion. I think that the mass media changes our thoughts and feelings easily too. We should not believe everything that mass media say and we should careful about that.
NBE03454,I agree with your opinion strongly. I think that the consciousness to take life of another person upon itself is very important. Then such accidents may decrease if they do so it. We must be conscious all over the world as well as Japan and Korea. We have a sad experience if we do so it. I will pray for a peaceful thing in future!
NBE03438,"When I read this article, I was really surprised at the fact that the employees at Chonghaejin spent only $2 on training last year. When I first heard this news, I thought the captain and the crews are responsible for this accident. However, I thought that not only they but also the employees at Chonghaejin are responsible for this accident when I read this article. I want the employees at Chonghaejin to take measure not to happen accident again."
NBE03459,"I think the captain of the ferry should be responsible. 15 members of the ferry should also be blamed. But the captain has responsible for their member's mistakes and faults. Moreover the captain should know ferry's cargo limit and must load under it. Furthermore the crew members, including the captain, said the coast guard was responsible for rescuing the passengers. However I think they only wanted to escape from being blamed. So the coast guard should rescue the passengers as soon as possible but even if they have to do it, the crew members have to be blamed."
NBE03418,"Now, they have got the detail of the accident and cause of it. Next, they should take measures to review their crisis management system. They must get off for-profit steering, and consider the safety seriously. Of course they have the keen purposefulness of betterment. . ."
NBE03436,"I was shocked when I read this article, because more than three hundred people is still dead or missing. I cannot understand why the captain has escaped from his own ship and leave his passengers. It is natural that the bereaved families abuse crew member and Korean government. I think that not only Korea but also the whole world should think about ""safety"" one more time."
NBE03456,"I strongly agree with him. Merchant should think about the customers! Why can you sell your products? Because, people buy those. Your jobs absolutely need customers. Do you forgot those easy things? I would like to ask all companies about that."
NBE03453,I see that human is base in a new light when I heard this news. Human tends to make a near-term profit at the sacrifice of safety and tend to forget the risk and importance of safety. But a compensation of this action is so great. On this accident the Government must reconsider the standard of safety thoroughly.
NBE03423,"The most important problem is that the crew members didn't have intensions to have responsibilities for the accident. At least the crew members controlled the ship, and moreover, they left passengers. It is most problematic. I think they should be punished. It is true that there are problems that the ship was overloaded with poorly stowed cargo and the coast guard had responsibilities , but problems that the ship was overloaded is not exact and they also could save passengers. They should have done the best to save passengers."
NBE03419,"I think the captain have a responsibility to apologize. Of course, CEO should do so, too. The captain must be punished in the legal way. We must give Korea by technological and scientific support. What is the most important is the feeling of families mourning. Korea should indemnify. medias should tell us that."
NBE03448,"I have two opinions about this news. When I read related this news at first, this ferry's clues are poor, I think. Because they struggled for their lives. But in recent days, we can know the details about this accident. In this article, the vessel was overloaded with poorly stowed cargo after a risky redesign and safety was neglected as next to nothing was spent on crew training. So I got angry with the clues who left their passengers in spite of having the responsibilities. And I think if they should save their passengers until the ferry capsized, it is impossible. So making use of the reflection about this accident, we must reconsider ""the possibility as clue""."
NBE03450,"I have two opinions about this news. When I read related this news at first, this ferry's crews were poor, I think. Because they struggled for their lives. But in recent days, we can know the details about this accident.

So I got angry with the crews who left their passengers in spite of having the responsibilities. And even if they should save their passengers until the ferry capsized, I think it is impossible. So making use of the reflection about this accident, we must reconsider ""the possibility as crew""."
NBE03441,"When I read this article, I was very shocked because crew ran away at first. I think this action is bad and if I had been there, maybe I ran away. I can't blame them."
NBE03472,This news is shocking. I was surprised that the captain and crew left many people aboard and plea. I can't understand that they were wrong but escaped. Korean judges should strictly make a statement.
NBE03449,"I have two opinions about this news. When I read related this news at first, this ferry's clues are poor, I think. Because they struggled for their lives.

So making use of the reflection about this accident, we must reconsider ""the responsibility as crew""."
NBE03432,I can't understand crews' thought. They had duty to protect their passengers and this truth never change.
NBE03495,"I was very surprised to know that wearing the clothes of the opposite sex is also considered a homosexual act in the teachings of Islam. I knew that homosexuality is prohibited in Islam, but Islam has really tough precepts to make such provisions. However, Islam permeates in Dubai, and it is deeply rooted in people's lives. So foreigners entering such countries had better act with knowing the culture when they visit there and being careful for taboo of the region like 'when in Rome, do as the Romans do'. I also think there maybe a way that Muslims turn a blind eye to actions of foreigners. I understand that considering the difference of values of religious is hard again."
NBE03538,"Maybe, I think that I 'll be surprised a little to see a man who is wearing women's clothing. However, I was surprised to know that there are people who were facing deportation by cross-dressing more than it. I noticed that I don't know and understand well that there are so many ways of thinking, customs and senses of values in the world. There are many people who don't believe in a specific religion strongly in Japan and so I don't, so it is difficult to understand for us. In Islam, I think we should consider the feeling of Muslims particularly."
NBE03504,"When I read this article, I was really surprised at the fact that two Filipinos were arrested in UAE because they wore women's clothing. In Japan, men can wear women's clothing, because Japan attach the greatest importance to freedom of thought. However, men are not allowed to wear women's clothing, because UAE attach the greatest importance to their culture. Like this, there are differences in way of thinking between countries. We must learn about foreign countries, and understand them."
NBE03493,"I did not know cross-dressing was bad in some area, before I read this article. This is because for Japanese that behavior is not a matter. There are many various kinds of culture in the world, so of course there is one which we cannot expect. The world has globalized and this fact will improve our chances of meeting foreigners. In this situation, we should understand what is good or what is bad in the area in order not to be in trouble and hurt their feelings. We should obey the policy of the country,"
NBE03520,"When I read this article, I could not why they were dressed like a woman. However they have wore women's outfit since they were a child. So it is difficult for us to make not them not to wear it. Moreover if they wear that clothes, it will not affect us any way. Therefore I would like to suggest that the government should allow them to do so. But a different country probably has a different culture. That is why we also should not do such a unusual behavior in order not to get involved in trouble."
NBE03537,"Consideration was lacking although Filipinos were pitiful. It is not bad to wear clothes freely. It is his freedom. However, various culture and religion are all over the world, and there is a fixed concept. Probably, because the consciousness of sex role was strong in UAE, the tailors were arrested. The tailor of the Philippines should have known how he is seen in a strange land."
NBE03500,"When I this article, I felt this problem was so difficult. Religious problems in foreign country are always difficult to understand for Japanese. The cause this case happened is similar to the case in Sri Lanka. Both matters happened because of the difference of religious idea. Since the environment in childhood, culture and nationality are different, we can't judge which side is right. However I felt a little sympathy with the two Filipinos arrested for cross-dressing."
NBE03491,"This is very interesting article. Today, there are many countries which recognize politically men to behave like women. Its also for women. In such country a man can marry another men. However this article shows that some countries force people to behave as their sex. I think this difference come from the people attitude. In other words, people in some countries recognize things like the article showing as character, some other not. My attitude is former, and I think everyone should have the same idea."
NBE03514,"I think our understood about ""gender free"" caused this news. In recent years, there is the voice of the people for ""gender free"" all over the world. It means that we should ban the discrimination by gender difference. And now in Japan, whenever we turn on the TV, ""okama"" appears. Like this, ""gender free"" looks like on the road to be understood. But I don't think so. Because they are usually humiliated by others. I think "" gender free"" means not gender equality but individual equality. We should admit individual difference, for example the man wearing woman's clothes. I hope people can make decisions and do what to like without deporting all over the world."
NBE03516,I think that this incident is very difficult because of personal freedom and cultures which each country has. Personal freedom may be very important right for every people but culture is the thing that must be respected. I think people need to discuss this problem and understand each other in the globalized world.
NBE03508,"This article is more surprising than that about tattoos for me. I can understand a Buddha tattoo hurts someone's religious feeling, but men wearing women's clothing don't seem to hurt others' feeling. I can't understand why Dubai Police arrested them."
NBE03524,"There is many accidents like this in the world. Actually, if I see the people who is cross-dressing, I will be a little surprised. And I was also surprised that there is a culture that deport cross-dressing people. But I think the reaction like me is not common in the world. People in other countries usually believe a religion and there is many religions in the world. This means that there is many idea, sense of value, feelings, customs. But we Japanese do not believe religion strictly. I think because of this, we can't understand problem like this article. Nowadays Japan is more globalized and opportunities to experience other customs is increased. So we should learn more about this problem and become to be able to understand them."
NBE03519,"I was surprised that they were arrested for cross-dressing. The news confused me. It is because that this action do not affect the local people. I can understand the action I knew in the previous class was not good for the local people. Therefore, religion problem is very difficult for people all over the world. I think it is important to understand for other country which has other culture deeply. If we can do this, religion problems improve little by little. In the future, we consider what we should do for resolving religion problems."
NBE03521,"When I read this news, I recognized the world and a Japanese difference again. In Japan we can't be caught because the clothes are personal freedom, but there are many countries regulated like this news in the world. I think that the difference in religion and culture greatly affects it. However, a way of thinking of ""the gender-free"" is insisted on now in world many countries. I think that who may wear what kind of clothes if I say along the flow of time. Of course difficult one understands our way of thinking and their way of thinking in different one."
NBE03488,"When I read this article, I was surprised that people were arrested just because they wore cross-dressing. Today, there is problem about same sex marry or lover. I think same sex marry and lover could be allowed, because it isn't dangerous for other people who object to it, and if countries or governments don't allow this, it means that they take those freedom. However it isn't easy to solve this problem, because there are difference of culture, religion and so on. Maybe we must respect each country's culture."
NBE03502,"I was surprised to read this news. It is difficult to understand this problem because they are unconcerned about religion. In Japan, we can easily see a man who is wearing women's clothing because there is the freedom of expression. However, there are some countries which ban it by culture and religion. There are different cultures , religions and customs in the world. We should respect them. When we visit foreign country, We must keep in mind the words ; "" When in Rome do as the Romans do. """
NBE03484,"I think that two men should not be deported if they do not know the fact that cross-dressing is a taboo. It is true that they have freedom of expression. However, their cross-dressing insulted people in UAE. There are considerable taboos all around the world. It is not going too far to say that we have to be familiar with all the taboos. However, they should have understood taboos in a country in which they live. We cannot criticize the law of UAE because cross-dressing is permitted in Japan. We have to give careful consideration to each countries' conditions."
NBE03536,"I was surprised that there is a country deporting men for cross-dressing. Although the deport deprives them of freedom certainly, Dubai has taboos in their own way which we Japanese can't understand, so I can't say it's bad necessarily. However, I think the right of freedom should be protected globally. Gender problem won't be solved in the future. What we have to do is understand various thought of countries."
NBE03489,"Before reading this article, I have never heard this news so this surprised me very much. The fact that there is a country where people could be arrested for cross-dressing was unacceptable for me because I support the idea that we can wear whatever we like. According to this this article, the United Arab Emirates took strict action and deported the two men, however, they may have not known the cross-dressing was taboo there. I think such action was too severe to make them know the country's taboo. In Japan, a lot of people are polytheist and don't have enough knowledge about the religion. However, we are in a global society now and the number of those who travel foreign countries will be increasing. visitors will need to pay more attention to what they should perform before trip. Anyway, it is true that this kind of news has given rise to considerable concern all over the world."
NBE03510,"A gender identity disorder consider a kind of an illness. So these men's behavior is not blamed easily. When I look man like these, I think he is strange men or I am frightened. The reason why they wear that cross-dressing is not they want to be hate by people. The reason is they like these dresses as we choose favorite closes. If people wear any dresses, there is no problem. That is personal liberty, however, there are rules of each community. In the country , their behavior see bad. So people obey the rule at the public and the community. If they can't bear, they go to other community where there behavior are allowed . The problem about personal dignity and obeying a rule as a member of society is so difficult. It is so important that we learn and understand rules of each community in order not to occur these troubles."
NBE03531,"Because I had not heard such a story, I was surprised to read this article. What I was surprised at in particular is that they were jailed. In Japan, there is the man who disguised himself as a woman, but those people are not arrested and are not jailed for only a reason to disguise itself as a woman. Surely, I watched the man who disguised himself as a woman and have not felt good. But, It is personal freedom to wear one's favorite clothes, and I think that it is terrible to be imprisoned by the reason of cross-dressing he personal freedom should be respected to the maximum even if there was any religious reason or political reason."
NBE03532,"Because I had not heard such a story, I was surprised to read this article. What I was surprised at in particular is that they were jailed. In Japan, there is the man who disguised himself as a woman, but those people are not arrested and are not jailed for only a reason to disguise itself as a woman. Surely, I watched the man who disguised himself as a woman and have not felt good. But, It is personal freedom to wear one's favorite clothes, and I think that it is terrible to be imprisoned by the reason of cross-dressing. The personal freedom should be respected to the maximum even if there was any religious reason or political reason."
NBE03480,"In Japan, cross-dressing people used to be looked with a jaundiced eye. But now, I think the prejudice gradually tone down. That's because many of the Japanese does not stick around religious rules. It has its ups and downs. On another front, In the country attaching importance to religious rules, it seems to be difficult to establish harmony of religion and new culture."
NBE03525,"Two years ago, my friend's father worked in Dubai, and my friend also have been to Dubai. I did not know that Dubai is strict about fashions, so I really wanted to go there. However, when I read this article, I was so surprised to the fact that people were arrested because of their feminine like fashions and came to hesitate to go there. I have lived in Japan and France, and I have traveled in many other countries, but I have not felt any culture shock, so I didn't think about the culture or laws of countries to which I want to go. I should study them when I travel abroad next time."
NBE03483,"In my opinion, cross-dressing is less controversial than religious issues because it never insult others' rights and profits. So I think Dubai's decision that deport two Filipinos is too strict. However, there are many people who feel displeasure when they see cross-dressing. Two Filipinos should have do cross-dressing an inconspicuous place."
NBE03496,"I personally think that everybody should be able to wear any clothes they wanted to because fashion is a way to express oneself and it can be a part of identity. Of course, it is necessary and important not to disturb other's feelings because of the difference of the culture, however, it basically should depend on the people's will to decide which to wear."
NBE03526,"When I saw this news, I felt the world and a Japanese difference again. I think that it is very important to understand for other country which has other culture deeply, It is because deferent country have deferent culture. If we could care about this, religion problems would improve a lot. I think we should respect individual difference and throw the bias. I hope we could make more decisions without deporting the world."
NBE03513,"I felt a bit disappointed to see that there still are some authorities whose values do not allow the freedom of the sexual orientation and sexual attribution. I think that, in the flow of globalization, which spreads universal thoughts and makes the same social systems common all over the world , their hardline attitude will be old-fashioned and will not be able to catch up with current situation. In fact, in other students' comment, almost all the comments they made supports the thought that people should be free to wear what they want, which represents that it is time for ""out of date"" authorities to change minds."
NBE03499,"When I read this article, I was surprised at the fact that two Filipinos were arrested in UAE because they wore women's clothing. In the country, religion is deeply rooted people's lives. I think that , in the globalization, we should not have a prejudiced view toward other people's gender."
NBE03512,"The Arab countries seem to be too strict to public morals because of passionate faith to Islam. I think if a man wears a woman's shirt and a bra and has make-up, unless he is not dangerous, we may overlook that. And Dubai is very international country now, so restricting of too severe Islam can obstruct more and more development of this country, I think."
NBE03485,"I think it wrong for them to arrest people who are wearing a woman's clothes, only because they are wearing clothing of opposite sex. It is because I think it free for people to wear whatever clothes. Clothes are important as people's expression. If the clothes we wear are limited, we cannot express ourselves. For this reason, I think it uncommon that they are wearing clothes of opposite sex."
NBE03529,"Before I read this article, I didn't know that cross-dressing is a taboo in Muslim, and at the same time, I was very surprise that what is trifle in Japan is regarded as the violation of the law in some countries. Today, thanks to the globalization, we can see many foreign people in Japan, so it is very important to know the culture or value of other countries, otherwise we may hurt their feelings or may not make good relationship with them."
NBE03501,"I think that it is an interesting story. First, I surprised that foreign people do cross dressing because I thought that the cross dressing is only Japanese culture before I read this news. Second, in Filipinos, such people who do cross dressing are objects of arrest. I want to care about foreign culture more."
NBE03527,"I cannot show what we should do to solve this problem. On the one hand, every one has human rights. Therefore, homosexual persons should be guaranteed to live their wanted life. On the other hand, in Dubai, homosexuality has been prohibited strictly. Of course, it is impossible to restrain love by low. However, if other countries or organizations suppose the UAE withdraw the suppression of homosexuality, bigger disputes will occur"
NBE03505,"When I read this news, I was surprised. I can't understand why homosexuals act as such. However, people have the right to have a creed. Other people should not restrict their creed. I didn't know dressing as a women is an illegal act. Japan have that people who dress as a women. I sensed that the world was very wide. I want to know other countries' cultures."
NBE03523,"I think this kind of problem is so complicated, because it is relevant to gender, religion, difference between countries and so on. I have always been shocked at the articles like this. In this article, two Filipinos were arrested by UAE, because they wore women's clothing. I have two points that I want to claim. First, we should be more careful when we touch the different culture of other cultures. I think ""not knowing"" is the most dangerous. Second, we should also have tolerant mind. Understanding different cultures is so difficult, but it is important that we think individual freedom of cultures."
NBE03539,I was surprised that there is a country deporting men for wearing the clothes of the opposite sex. And it is also considered a homosexual act in the teachings of Islam. I hope to the world will become more comfortable to live for all people.
NBE03481,"I think we reach the time to accept such people whose bodies are male but their identities are women, and vice versa. Of course I know there are Muslims and Catholics those who do not accept homosexuality. But as biology have progressed, we realize people's bodies and minds are sometimes not completely match. But it is doubtful that the God almighty or Allah judges them ugly existences and orders us to prejudice such minority. What is different from Jew's thought, the God of Muslims and Catholics are very kind and loves us even we are imperfect. (of course sometimes we bring his superior's anger. ). And this is important, because we are all imperfect and different individuals, we have different imperfect factors. Some people have gender imperfections. This thought should be shared all people who are stereotype everythings. And kindness of him, we will abstract the thought homosexuality. We can live as we want. And arabic countries should abolish old fashioned criminal penalty immediately."
NBE03509,"I thought that cultures problems among countries are difficult. Previously I read the article that one British woman had arrested in Sri Lanka for her blasphemy. Like this, I understood the religion problem is very complex. I have been to Dubai and Saudi Arabia twice. There is a strict Muslim code of behavior. Even I as a foreigner had to put on Islamic coat. Even Adults are banned to drink alcohol. There are many more strict regulations there. I was surprised how rigid the Islamic religion is. So when I read this news , I was not surprised at this news so much. Because I have already known this is the Islam. But in general even if one man wears woman's clothes , he would not be arrested. Thus the religion problems is so complicated and we had better not intervene thoughtlessly."
NBE03530,"If i meets with the culture different from Japan, I will be surprised not a little. This news is also one of them. When I goes into the store of fast fashion, it overflows with the goods of a unisex design and is on the contrary. If eyes are shone well, it will be the spectacle of Japan being sufficient and seeing. It may be the culture very naturally accepted now when the difference between men and women in an occupation or a way of life is being lost."
NBE03518,"People should know the proverb ""When in Rome do as the Romans. "" In the globalized world, we need to respect other cultures. That's why we should follow the local ideas. However, we also have to care about foreign cultures. People can respect each other. We can make concessions."
NBE03482,"I think that protecting the dignity of the individual is very important. Each person also have each tastes. I think I will not be able to endure If we receives interference by the Government to personal preference. This article makes me aware of what is free, I thought."
NBE03487,"I know there are some ""new half ""s in Philippines and the culture of dressing as as woman may not be strange and regarded as one expression. However, UAE is the nation of Islam, so their strange appearance and action might be judged improper. In my opinion, it is natural that we have various thoughts respectively but we should consider whether it's OK to express or not depending on the situation."
NBE03494,I believe we have rights to choose what clothes we wear so the government should not force them not to wear women's clothes.
NBE03522,"This news is very shocking for me, because I've never heard people who are arrested because of their fashion style in modern world. I thought, in modern world, our view of gender is considerably liberal and matured, also in Philippines (of course I know this is stereotype, though. . . ) . And I think we should do so. However, this news broke such my hope, so I was very disappointed. I strongly hope that our way of thinking about gender will be matured over the world as soon as possible."
NBE03511,"Many Japanese people may think that to deportation them is too strict action against wearing women's clothes. In Japan, it is not odd for men to wear women's clothes and many people practice no religion. On the other hand, in Muslim countries, they have a strict protect about Islam. So, it is not easy to say that in Muslim countries, people can wear whatever they like and are allowed to do transsexualism when religious and ethnic problem is related. To avoid such a accident, we should investigate other country's culture before visiting or living in them. However, I think that the best thing is that all country get tolerant of sex and culture."
NBE03506,"When I read the article, I remembered a famous saying, ""When in Rome do as the Romans do. "" Certainly everyone has the freedom of choice and it doesn't ban to wear clothes like opposite sex. From the viewpoint of today's trends, intolerance of person's appearance is regarded as nonsense. However, if many people feel unhappy when they see someone's unusual clothes against their religions, the one should abstain from having the clothes. When in UAE do as the Arabs do. I think it is the first rule when we visit foreign country, which have different cultures from ours."
NBE03535,"I think we can't criticize this accident of deportation wholly, because there are a lot of customs and a lot kind of common sense. If we, Japanese criticize this punishment, then we deny the customs which has taken over for a long time in Dubai. It is too subjective view what is called prejudice. Thus, we should make every effort to see the other tradition in order to aim the eye without a biased viewpoint even impossible."
NBE03534,"I haven't known that cross-dressing is regarded as a bad manner in some countries before I read this article. I think it is difficult for Japanese people to understand this incident because there are various religions in Japan and we don't believe some peculiar religion deeply. However, recently Japan is becoming more and more globalized rapidly , so Japanese people may meet different culture more often. That's why Japanese people have to understand the feelings of people, who have different religion, culture, race, and history. I suppose Japanese people should make efforts to figure out the tradition of other country without preconception."
NBE03528,"I understand that we should respect each individual will. However, forcing certain thoughts is one of the acts of disrespecting others dignities. For the people of UAE, cross-dressing is under taboo. We also ought to respect their culture."
NBE03479,"I respect and foster cultural diversity. I think that it is ensured the freedom of clothes in every place. But, we can't force to understand that. The unique culture isn't easy to change. So, we should be tolerant of various views and develop a spirit of mutual understanding. We shouldn't think exclusively in terms of the other culture. I want to have a heart as big as all outdoors."
NBE03515,"Reading this article, I was a little bit disappointed. In my opinion this is the infringement of the fundamental human right. Whatever they wear, eat , do, the administrative machinery of a state should not ban them as long as they may not harm other's right. On one hand , I can understand that the culture has its own value and rule;On the other hand I presume that it should not collide with the one's values."
NBE03492,"I do not think so, because I think the proverb ""Do in Rome as the Romans do. "" is really reasonable. If we visit foreign countries, we should understand their culture and custom. Every convention and view of religion should be respected."
NBE03517,"There is such a topic while globalization advances, and the culture of various countries fuses. However, as for us, there are many illegal things just because of legality in one's country in other countries. After all it is important to follow the law of one's country. However, it cannot be said that I think about culture in all like that. It is difficult, but it seems to be important to recognize each other."
NBE03503,"I agree with his opinion. There are many cultures in this world, and there are many people who have a different way of thinking from us. So, we have to respect each other to get along with foreign people."
NBE03486,I understand you. I think it is free for people to wear clothing of opposite sex. So we should not discriminate the persons.
NBE03507,"When I read this article, I was surprised because it is forbidden that man wear woman's clothes in Islam. But culture should be allowed even if we can't understand the culture. We must respect it."
NBE03533,"I was very surprised to know that story. I think that there are people like that. In conclusion, cultural difference cause this problem. We should make communication all over the world. Therefore we can at least know foreign countries. In addition we should reconsider our culture."
NBE03498,"We must respect foreign cultures. When we visit a foreign country, we should learn this country's culture."
NBE03497,I think we should respect foreign values.
NBE03490,"When I read this article, I was also very surprised. The reason is that I didn't know the taboo that wearing the clothes of the opposite sex was considered a homosexual act in the teaching of islam. In Japan, the number of Muslim may be small so a lot of Japanese don't have enough knowledge about religion. However, we live in a global society and more and more people will have chances to go abroad. As my classmate says, I also find it very important to learn from the words, "" when in Rome, do as the Romans do. "" We should pay attention to several difference of each culture."
NBE03541,I think that capital punishment should be banned in Japan. Capital punishment has led to abuse of human rights. We should be skeptical about the necessity of death penalty. Why don't we innovate a way to life imprisonment? Death penalty deterrence is the same as life imprisonment. Life imprisonment has adequate deterrent force against crimes.
NBE03614,"A medicine injection that lead to acute pain should not be used for a death penalty and the death penalty should be abolished. Blame to using a medicine for a death penalty is carried out in the US whole country. This blame has prone to become strong. There are many methods of a death penalty. For example, Japan is hanging and China is shooting. Of course, there is no good method. It is because it altogether ignores human light. A death penalty causes important problems other than punishment. Therefore, you should abolish a lethal injection and the death penalty."
NBE03555,"In my opinion, we shouldn't abolish the death penalty , but we should argue the way of it. Today, many people say ""We don't need the death punishment. "" Its true that there are some ethical problem in the death penalty, however it doesn't conclude that we abolish it. We have to recognize that the death penalty have become prevention. I think we should invite the way of punishment which cut the hurt as much as possible."
NBE03612,"I think we should make death penalty banned. In my opinion, We can't pay our life as consideration the victim for our even terrible mistake. Instead of the executive, We should make the non-capital punishment more heavy."
NBE03577,Capital punishment using injection is very fearful. I will never commit a crime in the US.
NBE03560,"I think lethal injection should not be practiced. Somebody who inject chemical medicine into the condemned criminal will suffer under a heavy mental burden and he have to see the execution though. I think hanging in Japan is a cruel, but the mental burden will not be on executor so much than lethal injection because executors don't know who pressed the button to execute. I think that's the death penalty is cruel, but it should be devised so that emotional distress won't be given to both executor and prisoner if the execution are practiced."
NBE03599,"I think that Japan should abolish the capital punishment. Besides with the medicine if is executed; all the more. I think that it contradicts it on the other to get rid of the life of the person by the death penalty in an instant while conveying importance of the life. However, we may not forgive the person who committed a crime. Thus, I think that Japan should think about the punishment for the death penalty newly."
NBE03597,"I would like to suggest that the capital punishment should be prohibited in US. Even if the way to execute becomes more humane, it will be ignoring the human rights, Especially, in executing with those drugs, there are possibilities that the capital punishment becomes so gruesome like Clayton Lockett's case. Moreover executioners have a lot of mental burden when they carry out the death sentence. Therefore we should abolish the death penalty in US and also in Japan."
NBE03595,"I think the death penalty is necessary to atone for the sins which is can not be allowed to do. However, we should discuss the way of execution. I think that we must treat people who have committed a felony as the same people. It is difficult because of having a prejudice of criminals. However, I think it is natural that criminals feel the pain what they had done. Therefore, we have to consider how to execute the death penalty from now. Considering the death penalty is important to consider the right to humans."
NBE03569,"I think that all country should abolish the capital punishment. In the US when a condemned criminal is put to death executed , a lethal injection is used. This execution with pain infringes on a person's rights. Moreover , I have heard death penalty costs a large sum of money. I think it is not necessary to execute to spend money which people pay. Therefore we should abolish the capital punishment and I suppose life imprisonment."
NBE03547,"When I read this news, I felt it is ironical because those who are in opposition to execution made death penalty regime more barbarous. I think that criminals pay for their crimes by death. The states should take criminals' human rights into execution. When death penalty is carried out, a lot of people including the family of a criminal groan inwardly. I go into the feelings of people who are against capital punishment. However, we have to have capital punishment regime as the deterrent."
NBE03554,"I think it was good action for the European Union to sustain European campaign to stop these drugs for executions because this has led to a massive drug shortage in the U. S. As death penalty opponents say, we should consider how terrible such punishment is and find a new way to make criminals feel sorry for what they did. There will be needed to punish them, however, I think capital punishment cannot lead to peaceful settlement but terrible consequences. When the drug fails to work properly, both executioners and prisoners would experience the torture. Nowadays, there are being a lot of discussions about the death penalty issue and I think this is very severe problem. Although it is difficult to decide whether we stop such punishment promptly, it is the most important thing that each people reconsiders what the human right is like."
NBE03602,"I think capital punishment should be abolished, but sometime there is crime that criminal have to atone by death. So the way of execution like lethal injection should be considered seriously. In lethal injection, there is someone who inject medicine into criminal's body. This means that he excite criminal. Because of this, he may be suffer from mental damage that ""I killed criminal"". But in Japan, hanging execution, there are three people who push the button to execute. So they three don't know who executed criminal. It is clear that there is less mental damage than execution by lethal injection. Capital punishment is not good, but for the situations we need it, we have to consider about way of execution with less mental damage for executioner and protecting criminal's human rights."
NBE03552,"I don't sure whether countries should ban capital punishment or not. It is sure that a culprit who kill people or commit a gruesome crime have to be carried out a heavy punishment, but it isn't sure that even if a culprit was punished death penalty, victim's family may not be satisfied. However, even if there is no capital punishment, gruesome troubles will increase. My individual opinion is we may admit capital punishment, because it is effective not to increase terrible crimes."
NBE03579,"When I read the title, I couldn't understand what is the meaning. I suppose some actions of abolished the system of capital punishment is good. So I think people should oppose the punishment in order to save criminal's human rights. But this title indicated my ideas are not right. So I considered this problem from the different point of view. I can't understand the reason why capital punishment is carried out. I think the way to punish the people is no use, because a criminal have no chance that he understand that is bad thing and reflect on his action. I have a question that criminal is forgiven or the problems are resolved by punishment. I think we should teach what is bad thing and what is good thing is important for a criminal and a society. So I think capital punishment should be abolished. When I read this article, I suppose we should think about looking for the way not to punish but to mend a criminal's mind and action."
NBE03603,"When I read this article, I was so surprised to know that the lethal injection used in executions are not used by physicians in the US. I think capital punishments are not necessary in any countries. However, if my family or my friend were to be the victim, I might think that executions are necessary. I think the best way to pay regard to victims and death penalty's opponents' opinions is executing without lethal injections."
NBE03613,"I think capital punishment should be abolished. Although it's important to impose a penalty for criminals in order to repeat and increase crimes, the penalty is pointless if he or she doesn't live. The criminal should atone for an offense by action. If capital punishment is executed, the crime isn't forgiven. And from the point of human right, it's concerned with ethical problem that criminal die suffering from acute pain. Thus, we should abolish capital punishment."
NBE03609,"Recently, the death penalty is seemed to be barbaric or illegal. However, it is demanded by the family of victim of a murder case. I think that if I were in a position of them, I may hurt or kill the murder by myself. To prevent such a situation, the capital punishment should not be abolished. Of course, a support to anesthesiology physicians and executioners is important. If the national government or state give a big support to them mentally and financially, they may not opposite to the execution."
NBE03546,"I think it is very difficult problem because the more death penalty opponents are gained, the more lethal injection occur. We should stop lethal injection from its origin, for example, stop manufacturing drugs. Also I think we should finally abolish death penalty because it cause a chain of hatred. It is important to support criminals return to the society and never they commit a crime."
NBE03605,"When I saw this article, I felt it is ironical, because those who are in opposition to execution made death penalty regime more barbarous. I think that the capital punishment should be prohibited all over the world. It is because it is not necessary to use. We should think about how to execute the death penalty. Careering about the death penalty is important to think about the human rights."
NBE03565,"I think that it is very difficult problem because the more death penalty opponents are gained, the more lethal injection occur. We should stop lethal injection from its origin, for example, stop manufacturing drugs. But, I cannot decide whether the government should abolish death penalty or not. It is very difficult problem. So we should consider the problem."
NBE03583,"It is surely important that the execution method is humanitarian. Because a criminal has the human rights tentatively. However, I am against insisting on the abolition of capital punishment only for a reason that ""the execution method is non-humanitarian. "" We must think about the substitute plan for it well if we abolish the death penalty. This is because they are the criminals who committed a crime and were sentenced to death although they have their own human rights."
NBE03549,"there are death penalty problems we have difficulties in solving. In the problems, most important, the drugs we use when we execute people who crime give them suffering, and we should think weather people who crime have rights or not. In America, three drugs was probably used in death penalty. But I think states should use only one drug to carry out lethal injections due to human rights concerns. We also should think better of death penalty."
NBE03561,"I was surprised at the fact that death penalty is under such complicate situation. I personally think capital punishment itself is not violating the human rights, and there are some benefits to conduct it. For example it can be a deterrent and prevent criminals from commit a clime. However, death penalty under the such condition seriously undermine human rights. Even criminals should be able to die in piece with feeling regret that they commit the clime."
NBE03545,"Abolition of the death penalty is a difficult problem. the numbers of countries of the abolition of the death penalty are increasing more and more, it is also prohibited in EU in the this article. As a result, the lack of drug protocol for the death penalty has spread to the United States. To live as one of the human rights is important, there is a need to consider the death penalty from a humanitarian standpoint. , Including the problem of drug protocol."
NBE03543,"I know that capital punishment should be abolished for protecting criminal's human rights and even if the punishment is implemented, the way should be taken account of ethical aspect. But, I think that if I were on the place of victim's family, I couldn't think dispassionately like that. Besides, about the way of condemned death, it remains the question""although crimeless people are killed by atrocious way, the criminal should be executed by easy way""."
NBE03607,"When we look at the world, there are many countries that adopt death penalty, and many people say that we should find a better and more humane way to execute prisoners or should abolish it. Certainly whether we adopt death penalty or not is a controversial issue. However, before we talk about it, what we have to do is to face the reality that there are crimes that deserve death penalty, and find ways to decrease them. If we can succeed in it, it is sure that a better society will come."
NBE03589,"Capital punishment using lethal injection should be abolished. It cause the horrific situation, in other words, we may give the prisoners the pain that is more painful than the deed he did. It isn't humanitarian. We humans only have the intelligence, so we can improve the situation. In my opinion, It is true that the criminals should be punished in some way, but it should not be painful. This is so difficult problem that we take a long time to consider the solution."
NBE03606,"Thanks to Oklahomas botched execution, it is clear that drug punishment is outdated. This is because it seems impossible to create drug injection system that is more humane. As writer says, pharmaceutical firms decline to supply the most efficacious lethal injection drugs. Moreover, today, human and animal experimentations have been limited. Therefore, we cannot make more humane lethal drugs. The writer proposes death penalty opponents should re-consider their act. However, i suggest the 32 states of USA which have capital punishment should re-consider their present lethal punishment system. They should decide two choices , one is developing more humane executions, and the other is abolishing their lethal punishment systems."
NBE03572,"The problem of capital punishment is very difficult. Some countries banned it. In Japan opponents insist that Japan should follow other countries. In my opinion, capital punishment should not be abolished. But the way of execution must not be inhumane. For example, government must not use them to test new drugs."
NBE03616,"I think that capital punishment should be banned, because there is a risk of wrong execution. Instead of it we need to build system of treat of criminals."
NBE03601,"I was surprised when I read the headline of this article, because there are shocking words""Death penalty opponents are making capital punishment more gruesome. "" At First, I can't understand it. It seems whether capital punishment should be abolished or not consists complicated things I have ever expected. In my opinion, capital punishment should be abolished, because as long as it exists, the true peace will never come. It is true that capital punishment restrains the crime, but we should reconsider what is proper punishment."
NBE03568,"I was shocked reading this news , and also surprised that we do not know who is actually performing which part of any one lethal injection. The fact that the reason lethal injection has become more gruesome and violent is at least partly a result of opposition to the death penalty is contradict and deplorable."
NBE03608,"A death penalty problem becomes the center of attention frequently even in Japan. Japan has introduced capital punishment. The same may be said also of South Korea and China, neighboring countries. I think that capital punishment is culture. People will be rewarded if he commit the crime which should be carried out death. Seeing historically, the death penalty existed from ancient times considerably. Japanese people think that we should not stop capital punishment for the reason other countries do not accept a death penalty. we should have an opportunity to discuss on humane grounds."
NBE03576,"When I read this article, I think that capital punishment should be abolished in Japan. Killed person can't come back to life, so false charge must not happen. But a judgment is person, so a mistake certainly occurs. In addition, murder is prohibited by law in Japan , but the state is carrying out homicide formally. I think that this is inconsistent. From the above thing, I think that the capital punishment should be abolished."
NBE03593,I agree the capital punishment but I think injections are not good ideas. I suggest the hanging. Americans or Europeans hate the hanging. But it is much easier and less pains than injections.
NBE03591,"I don't think death penalty should be abolished because I'm sorry about bereaved families when I think about their feelings. If death penalty are abolished death rows will survive and be given the time that they think their action over, but people who was killed by them will never revive. This contradiction must not be allowed."
NBE03600,"The right and wrong for the death penalty has been a huge issue since the death penalty had started. There has been countless opinions for the pros and cons for the death penalty and the way to carry it out. If the method of killing the criminal is too harsh or cruel, it definitely violates human rights. However, as they say, ""An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth"" , the criminal did something that deserves getting the death penalty. These two opinions clash with each other very often. I believe that although the criminal did commit a crime that was equal to being sentenced to death, it is morally and ethically wrong to torture the criminal like this. We should all think more about what method is truly right for the death penalty and whether we should abolish it or not."
NBE03559,"I disagree with the idea of banning the death penalty. This is because the capital punishment has deterrence power . Indeed, if we abolished the death penalty , crimes may happen more ."
NBE03585,"To me, banning the death penalty seem too idealistic. Of course it harms human rights in a way, but without it, how can we punish malicious criminals? Jailing them forever can be one solution, but I think it has some bad aspects, such as costs that is necessary to run prisons and the fear that we may not be able to control horrible criminals with punishments that ""respects human rights"". In fact, the Republic of the Maldives, which had banned the capital punishment, recently adopted it again because there were many prisoners and they became almost out of control. My point is that we should discuss this problem more and more deeply, and take as much time as possible. Prior to the decision, we should consider pros and cons about the embargo of the execution."
NBE03578,"I think that death penalty should be abolished. Some says that it would be deterrent. Criminals who are about to commit crimes would stop doing that because they scare the capital punishment. However I should abolish this system. Firstly, the right of human is not protected. People should not be killed by someone and can live freely even if they are criminals. Secondly, it would be cruel if innocent men would judged to charge death penalty mistakenly. It is false charge. This charge break someone's live and make acquaintances of the man sad. In conclusion, death penalty should be abolished."
NBE03581,"I also oppose execution of inmates who have committed heavy crimes because it violates human rights. We should make effort to abolish capital punishment, but it is very difficult. This is because this problem is related to ethical problem. Moreover, there are not more effective ways of punishment than capital punishment. So, it is more important to find effective way of punishment than to claim that capital punishment must be abolished. IN the USA and Europe, they use lethal injection to execute criminals on death row . It is said to be humane comparatively but, as Oklahoma execution of Clayton Lockett, terrible things sometimes happen. If execution continues, there must not be such a things."
NBE03573,"Many people are for death penalty, and many people are against death penalty. This issue is so controversial that everyone has their opinion. Perhaps, this argument will not end. But, I think death penalty should not be abolished. Certainly, capital punishment is cruel for the criminals. Someone would think death penalty violates human dignity and rights, and no one have the right to deprive criminals of their lives, even a major power. However, it is obvious that capital punishment is a deterrent to crime. If authorities do away with death penalty, crime rate would increase rapidly and the public peace would be disturbed. That's why I'm for death penalty."
NBE03615,"In Japan, death penalty is adopted. It is the truth that the death penalty is useful for Japan now. The existence of it is deterrent of felonies. If it came to be abolished, the number of crimes may increase rapidly. However, I don't agree to death penalty. I have heard newses about false charges recently. People who served many years in prison on a false charge were robbed their precious life time and it never return to them. Possibly people who are innocent are condemned to death. I'm frightened at that it occur actually."
NBE03611,"I am interested in whether capital punishment is abolished, so I read this article more earnestly than the other article. To be honest, I think that capital punishment should be abolished . However we may have to think the way for criminals to atone for their sin, if the capital punishment were abolished. I suppose we should give the criminals the chance to understand what his action reflected on and what the bad thing is. We have to get the criminals back on the right track again , not punish them, and that will contribute greatly to everyone in order to form the safe society."
NBE03584,"In terms of human rights ( in other words, in principle), I agree with you in every aspect. But in reality, we are short of money to realize the ideal way to treat criminals that does not harm their rights. If we abolish the capital punishment, we cannot deny that something will happen that makes our society out of control."
NBE03553,"I strongly agree with your opinion. To discuss about death penalty is very difficult, but it is very important. I think death penalty should be allowed, because if there us no lethal penalty, cruel crime may increase. However, how to exact have to be discussed carefully. It is because, it is related to people's right to live. So, I agree with that we have to think about how to execute carefully."
NBE03551,"I don't agree with you. I think death penalty is necessary for us. It is because death is very heavy punishment, so it is suitable for people's judgment who commit a heavy crime. And I can't imagine the substitution."
NBE03598,"I disagree with your opinion. This is because we have not become a victim, we insist when we should abolish the death penalty, but think that a feeling not to be able to permit stays even if it is the death penalty when it is really to a victim. In addition, the criminal ordered the death penalty causes a serious crime. The imprisonment for life is one of the heavy penalties, but surely thinks that after all it is different from the death penalty in heaviness by the imprisonment for life. Therefore the system of the death penalty thinks that it is necessary to consider the thought of the left bereaved. Of course it is not a meaning beginning newly in the abolished country now."
NBE03567,"When I read this article, I can't understand well about ""the real culprit in the death of Clayton Lockett "". Why does the real culprit that killed him in the gruesome way become the opposition to the death penalty? I think it doesn't make sense. If the result of opposition to the death penalty leads to the conclusion that lethal injection has become more violent in recent years, they do not continue insisting that no capital punishment system will ever be tolerated, should work with those who demand executions in order to create a system that is more humane in the right now."
NBE03540,"I don't agree with you. Certainly, victim's emotional request for a harsh penalty must be appreciated. So, I can understand your logic. But, that wouldn't be solving the problem. When the criminal person is executed, the families of victims can't recover from grief maybe. I think that the victims is dissatisfied regardless of the sentence. Thus, overriding problem is not so much victim's emotional but protection of human rights."
NBE03566,"I don't agree with your opinion. I think death penalty should be abolished. There are many people committed a serious crime that they should atone with their death. Besides, if death penalty were abolished, could the family of the victim accept the decision? When I think their feelings, I can't say it should be abolished."
NBE03604,"I disagree with your opinion. I think we should have death penalty. It is because in some case, we need this penalty. If some people killed someone, I think judge death penalty is the best way."
NBE03550,"I think the capital punishment system is necessary but once we adopt that system, we should execute the punishment as smoothly as we can and mustn't cause the accident like the case of Clayton Lockett. Taking into account the feeling of the family of the victim, the death penalty is quite valid and is deterrent which discourage the occurrence of atrocious case."
NBE03571,"The problem of death penalty is not a simple problem. Death penalty is definitely cruel, but the cruelness of death penalty is holding down the number of crimes. So, the number of crimes will be increase if death penalty is abolished. We have to consider carefully about this problem."
NBE03558,"Opinions are divided as to whether the death penalty should be abolished or retained. Whichever one is chosen, the most importance thing is treating human life equally and carefully. However, from the point of view of victim, death penalty may be a reasonable sanction. As stated above, we could not come to the conclusion of this discussion easily. I think Japan has a strong feeling of protection of victims and death penalty will continue."
NBE03592,"I think that you should not abolish the death penalty as my opinion. Probably I think that it is the heaviest punishment. I think that it becomes the deterrent by there being such a punishment. However, we must think about human rights. We must be very careful on carrying out punishment. We may become a criminal if we do not carry it out after having regarded human rights as the death penalty well."
NBE03570,"I disagree your opinion. Death penalty is definitely cruel. However, the cruelness of death penalty is holding down the number of crime. We must not decide promptly that death penalty should be abolished."
NBE03596,"I strongly disagree with you. If criminals are punished death penalty, bereaved families cannot be happy. Moreover criminals also have parents so we have to consider such people. Therefore I suggest that capital punishment should be abolished."
NBE03594,I disagree with your idea. Capital punishment is needed for Japan. Capital punishments limit the crime. We should not forget this fact. We need to think about our laws with our ideas not foreign ideas.
NBE03542,"I don't think so. The way of punishment should be more humane, not abolish the capital punishment. It is said that there are a given number of crimes in spite of the presence or absence of capital punishment and weigh of perpetrator's life is the same weigh of victim's one. However perpetrators owe weigh of responsibility. I think it is compelling to teach criminals the weigh of life. But we must be careful about false accusation."
NBE03580,"As I said my opinion on the same article, we should not abolish the capital punishment right away. Moreover, as she said, the death penalty still play an important role on preventing people from murder. We should think of this problem not emotionally but logically."
NBE03582,"I don not agree with you. Life imprisonment takes a lot of cost, we do not want pay our money for people who have committed grave crimes. Instead adopt this idea, we had better make a better way to punish crimes."
NBE03548,I disagree with your opinion. I think the capital punishment is needed. I think the capital punishment should be improved.
NBE03587,"I think death penalty should be abolished all over the world. Of course, I was against using lethal injection. Because we shouldn't be killed any person by any means. And I believe even brutal criminals can become a good persons. So we should give a chances to them."
NBE03588,"I think death penalty should be abolished all over the world. Of course, I'm against using lethal injection. Because we shouldn't be killed any person by any means. And I believe even brutal criminals can become good persons. So we should give chances to them."
NBE03610,"I think that capital punishment is crucial but should be banned. Murders lose other's life. Although they have human rights, they should be punished."
NBE03544,"The death penalty is one of the most controversial matter we have today. But if we abolish the death penalty, what is the prisoners going to be? They would be imposed a life sentence. But I know the prisoners in French lose their mind. Yes, it is true that death penalty is violation of the rights of life, but it is also true that life sentence is the violation of human dignity and inner thought. So we have to stop thinking life sentence is a perfect penalty. Therefore we should think carefully abolishing death penalty."
NBE03574,I disagree with your opinion. I think capital punishment should remain in Japan.
NBE03575,"I strongly agree with your opinion. Capital punishment should not be abolished. Your opinion is right, and capital punishment is a strong deterrent to crime."
NBE03586,"I disagree with you because I think death penalty should be abolished. And there are some reasons. First, I think the death penalty doesn't play a part as prevention. In practice, there isn't difference on a number of crimes between the countries that have death penalty and the countries that don't have it. And it includes many ethical problem. So I think it should be abolished. But if it can't be abolished, I agree to your opinion, ""I think we should invite the way of punishment which cut the hurt as much as possible. ""."
NBE03590,I disagree with you. I think death penalty don't abuse of human rights. Criminals condemned to death did cruel crime. Their deed did many people harm and made many people sad. So
NBE03564,I disagree with you. All the country should need the capital punishment because execution is the only way to save the victim and their family.
NBE03563,I think we should abolish death penalty because the most important right of human is right of living and criminals have chance to live correctly again.
NBE03562,I agree with you. I think your opinion is to the point. Explanation make your argument clear.
NBE03556,"From the point of victims, I can't help saying that their feeling are never cured and the best way to mild it is the give serious sentence to criminals. Although it sounds like I saying it from emotion, how can we cure victims feeling without punishing criminals. It is necessary to consider the criminals' rights, however it's coming after considering the victims"
NBE03557,"In my opinion, the capital punishment is different from just killing people. Criminals just ask for what they did, and it couldn't be rejected. Although criminals are man and they have right, they robed it of others. I know the word I'm going to say isn't right and many people criticize me but I say the people who robed someone's right deserves being punished. Moreover, the punishment serves as the prevention of crime. So we should have the kind of prevention."
NBE03669,"I think it is impossible to establish privacy laws and regulations which benefit all of us. everybody has made mistakes. In addition, every one has bad memories and want others not to find the matters. Of course it is important to reconsider past faults. We should reconsider past faults in order not to fail again. However, there is a difference between individual reflection on our own faults and open them to the public. If there are articles about somebody's fault on the website, the person has a possibility that he has been ridiculed and insulted even after the person died."
NBE03677,"Although this is an important problem which is opposed to freedom of the press, what should be considered in the first place is public interest. At first, it was Google which seethed with anger at the ruling. But after all ""the right forgotten"" was accepted and Google started making to clear of data. However, it is doubtful which rights -- the freedom of a report or the right to be forgotten-- excel. Don't burden only search engine with responsibility. The most important thing is whether they bring people's benefit or not."
NBE03646,"The right to be forgotten seems to be more important than the right to know. It is true that private information on the internet is just noise for many people. However someone might be interested in the information, and spread it. It's the matter. We have to pay attention to our privacy because it's unexpectable that what happens on the internet."
NBE03662,"The development of the Internet does life very usefully, but thinks that we must not forget that such a problem may come out either. The problem of the privacy is very difficult and is not the thing which can be easily solved. It is important to ""the forgotten right"" finished in a topic this time, but thinks that it is difficult to make a standard. But I think that it was a chance that it is thought by having got nervous in a topic like this time. In this way, I think that it is very important that I guarantee the right that is necessary or important for people."
NBE03629,"I found this kind of matter very difficult because it is hard to make ruling to balance between privacy and freedom of expression. Nowadays, we are able to use the Internet whenever or wherever we like, and this made our daily lives convenient. At the same time, however, we see a threat to several problems. We often hear that there are a lot of Internet risks such as computer viruses or addictive games. The news of hacking of the Internet Explorer stolen bank, credit card details became well-known. In this news, debt was information which Gonzalez wanted to forget so I think it is true that he seethed with anger at search engines. However, all of us have to understand that many people all over the world can see the website and be more sensitive about ""privacy"" as users."
NBE03659,"The Internet system is essential for the people when we do something in the present lives. Certainly, I often use the Internet in the study. I am not damaged the Internet problems. However, I cannot predict when I am damaged. It is difficult problem because it is ambiguous how far we are able to publish individual informations. When I read this article, I try to pay attention to being involved such a problem."
NBE03624,"We could not live everyday life without the Internet. The Internet is very useful to communicate with a lot of people all around the world. At the same time, it is accompanied by danger. Our privacy may be invaded. We are given the freedom of expression that support democracy. However, I think the government should make a ruling that protect privacy. On the other hand, i am worried the day may come when people will be controlled by technology and lose their individuality."
NBE03649,"It is difficult to make up a well-balanced idea between personal privacy and public right of access to information. The Internet is useful for many people. And the search engine is also useful for us. If the system is abolished , many people loss the convenient system. Who will get benefit on the case. I agree the article said that the winner is a criminal and convicted person. Because their worse information are erased . That is good news for them. But all information are erased, if people want, people rob the right and ways to know a lot of information. So When the information is erased, we discuss and consider whether the information is important for public and people. If that is Important information for public and people, that is left on the Internet . Although the way to erase take many times, the problem is so important for ours life and right that we should take as much time as we are satisfied. And we should hold the balance between privacy and the right to know ."
NBE03672,"Whenever it comes to individual privacy data , ""right to be forgotten"" should be admitted. It is true that you can find much information through the internet easily and instantly. But this also means that people who want to disturb you can access to information about you. at this time, your privacy data would not be erased once it flowed out on the internet. In other words, your privacy data continues to live permanently. It is too dangerous to use the internet. Thus , ""right to be forgotten"" should be admitted."
NBE03630,"As the Internet has developed, there are also developing many problem with it. We have access to huge information, and whatever the information is they will never be deleted without we doing so. In other words, the information updated to the Internet is never lost naturally. We can't help saying that now is the time that people do never forget the something on the Internet. Also, we have to consider the way to protect personal right."
NBE03676,"In modern times, Internet influence a lot all of the world. The right of privacy also is suffered from the many information of people. However, Internet system is very useful in our life, so we can't stop using it. Most important thing when we use it is see through the correct information. If we can do it, It help us know , watch and hear various data. I want to pay attention to incorrect information."
NBE03636,"I think that this kind of matter is very difficult because it is hard to make regulation about privacy and freedom of expression. These days, we can use the Internet whenever or wherever, and this make our lives convenient and rich. At the same time, however, we have a possibility of some risks of Internet. For example, computer viruses, addictive games or hacking of the Internet and so on. We should consider the right way of using Internet."
NBE03628,"This is very important problem for us, particularly the young. Today, everyone who has a computer or cellphone can use Internet, and it is very convenient for us to search something. Internet give people convenient environment. However, Internet has also dangerous side. In this article, it said individual privacy is faced danger. These days a lot of people use SNS, for example Facebook and twitter. Those SNS are very interesting for us, but we have to take care how to use, or we may faced problem as in this article. So, I think what we can do now is to use Internet and SNS carefully."
NBE03651,"The Internet is very convenient, but is really dangerous. People may be unconscious, but, for example, it leads to a leak of the personal information even to put one's photograph of the face on the profile image of SNS. Besides people of the world can see the public records - even if it is convenient or inconvenient for oneself. If records that the contents are not good for the person are left semipermanently, affecting that is bad in the later life of the person may be inevitable. Therefore I think that ""right to be forgotten"" is necessary."
NBE03666,"Today we can get any information from the internet, and communicate with people all around the world any time. It is so convenient. But it also mean we have possibility of getting many risks like viruses, bad informations having bad influences and privacy problems etc. . We don't know when and how damaged such a problems. So it is important that we are putting our lives at risk every time whenever we are using internet."
NBE03621,"Privacy is an important right for people. Freedom of the press and the right to know might be a thing can be in conflict with privacy. However, once such information is spread to people, it is not possible to erase it. I think that there is a great obligation for a company with a large social impact, such as Google to the protection of privacy. , I want you to be so. I thought it was because it is society that many people use the Internet, we also must become more sensitive."
NBE03622,"Your opinion is interesting. Indeed, the majority of people have no interest in the privacy of others. However, there are people who are not a little interested. I felt it's privacy in order to guard against such people."
NBE03670,"Nowadays, we cannot think of the world without Internet. We can search various information like personal history from Internet. However, when we do so, we always face the problem. If we support one's privacy and people can just erase whatever they want, it means others miss the opportunities to know about them. And if we support the idea that people have the right to know and people can't delete the information they want others not to know on Internet, the person may miss the chance to start over. As I mentioned above, this problem isn't easy to be solved, but we should always consider what is the best approach to it."
NBE03634,"I personally think that right to know is more important than the right to be forgotten. When we are trying to find employment, the companies won't be able to know what kind if person we are without the right to know. We should rethink the importance of the right to know."
NBE03623,"Today, there are so many information on the Internet and we have probability that we leak our personal informations. However, we can't live without Internet anymore. It is energetic in various aspect of our lives. It is important to repress leaking our personal informations ourselves, before make law or regulation which protect our privacy."
NBE03665,"These days, we can't live our daily life without information on the Internet. There are a lot of useful information, but we don't know whether it is true or not. It is said that especially Japanese people have less media literacy than those of other countries in the world. We should have critical judgment when we use the Internet. Also, we should be more careful when we provide the Internet with information, especially that of privacy."
NBE03643,"This is very difficult problem. Today, information spread over the world through Internet in an instant. So we must be careful to send our own information. We may have a trouble. If we can remove the links, it is helpful. However, we have freedom of speech. Some people can overuse the right to be forgot. I want to pay attention to this topic in the future"
NBE03640,"I think the right to be forgotten is more important than the right to know. Because of the development of the Internet, it becomes easy to search a lot of information. However it means that everyone can find someone's privacy data, so it can cause a trouble. If I write careless comments on the Internet, I will involve with trouble. Therefore I think the right to be forgotten is important."
NBE03679,"This kind of matter is very difficult because it is hard to make regulation about privacy and freedom of expression. As the Internet has developed, our life is more convenient. However we also have possibility of getting many risks. So we have to reconsider the use of Internet."
NBE03637,"Today, we can have enormous information thorough Internet. It is so convenient and it make our life affluent. However, various problems arise naturally over information. For instance, the privacy rights of the individual and the public's right to know should be protected for us. However, in the fact, balancing the two perfectly is impossible. Information on Internet is sometimes makes us happy, also sometimes hurt us. I think it is important that we judge what is useful, safe correct information. We must not depend on Internet, must get along with it."
NBE03671,"I don't forget the day when Prime Minister Abe rammed the ""right to know. "" It is because his act which shakes democracy deserves blame. The problems of privacy surround our every day. We could not go out outside, if a line called privacy is not drawn. But, this ""right to know"" is not a right for someone to try to get to know us. this is the right we know about what the government is performing. As for me, having been deprived of the right is very sad. I may also forget this some day. But, I thought that I will continue studying since i don't forget it."
NBE03654,"There are two rights, ""right to know"" and ""right to be forgotten"" in this news. If we don't have the former, we won't be able to watch mass medias and officials as citizen. And I think it also embodies human's reflection about war. So we must not lose it. On the other hand, if we don't have the latter, we'll be burdened with our gloomy past. And I think those who has brilliant past are also burdened. So we must not lose both of them. But they cannot live together. Right should be used correctly, I think. Before we insist on our right, we need to confirm whether we understand how to use right or not."
NBE03632,"To be sure , we have rights to know. However , we should keep others privacy because no one want to be known everything about myself ."
NBE03633,"I think that right to know is very important, so the government and media should reveal informations as possible as they can. Certainly, it is important that any information circulate because the information might be harmful for anyone. However, people had better know many informations that will not have a risk for society and people's living. Search engines and government should choose good informations to opening to the public."
NBE03668,"I think this kind of issue is very difficult. It is because it is hard to make regulation about privacy and freedom of expression. Nowadays, we can use the Internet whenever or wherever, and this make our lives convenient and rich. I think we should do now is to use Internet carefully."
NBE03650,"I cannot say my opinion about this problem clearly because this problem is beyond me! I do not want to let strangers look into my privacy data or to lose the freedom of expression. The former is personal threat and the latter is national threat. If anything, the latter is more terrible, in my opinion. It is difficult to balance protecting privacy with freedom expression. But as this article says that search engines are the tools that allow users to make sense of the vast quantity of information on the Internet and find what they are looking for, I think this problem is good in that it made us meditate what privacy is like and what freedom expression is like . This problem is up to us, so we should be more interested in this and understand them."
NBE03675,"I think we should draw the line between the extent of opening our privacy. I don't want to share my privacy information to my stranger on the Internet, on the other hand, I want to share my information to my friends. The companies of social networking must respect their consumer's criterion. Thus, I think privacy must have priority over the right of expression on the Internet."
NBE03638,"I thought that the right to forget is good idea because If I found my personal information or my embarrassing photos on the Internet, I would be unpleasant. With the right to forget, I can erase them quickly and can avoid more troubles. In this information-oriented society, the right to forget will be more and more needed."
NBE03644,"Today, the Internet is so essential for us that we can't live our daily life without it. And the progress of the Internet is striking and remarkable. However, we are facing a lot of serious issues as the Internet system was progressed. The biggest issue is a ""privacy"" issue, which are mentioned in the article. It is said that ""A wonder lasts nine days"", but once an article was updated to the Internet, we can't delete it perfectly and it would not disappear permanently. That's because the Internet connects us all over the world and if we use search engine like google or Yahoo!, we can find almost all information from a huge data bank. There's no escape. Therefore, in order to protect ""the right to be forgotten"", we (or governments) should do something before it is too late."
NBE03674,"I think it is difficult to solve this problem because if we regard the privacy as important, we may slight the freedom of expression and if we regard the freedom of expression, we may slight the privacy. That's why we have to consider the balance between the privacy and the freedom of expression when we argue this problem. Nowadays we couldn't live our daily lives without the Internet , so this problem is very important for everyone. In addition, there are a lot of crime and fraud on the Internet. I suppose we have to consider more seriously about this problem and think how we should use the Internet over more once."
NBE03652,"This article's point is surely plausible. But I am afraid that advocating ""the right to know"" more than ""the right to be forgotten"" ends up harming the human dignity. It might be an important theory to keep information about people who committed a crime in the past to enhance social collective awareness. But in practice, a great deal of information that exists on the Internet is not always about criminals. That is, there is a lot of personal information about ordinary and innocent people, a part of which might be used by someone for crime. Does our society really need information about such people? In other words, does it make our awareness about ""social security"" higher?I think it does not. It is almost impossible to deny ""the right to be forgotten"", when you think about people whose personal information happened to be online. Of course, we can't live a day without information technology like the Internet. But even so, a clear protection for privacy is necessary."
NBE03661,"I agree with your opinion. I think it is difficult for them to keep the balance between personal privacy and public right access to information. The Internet is used all over the world, and much information spreads. Therefore management of the information is difficult, and it is a fact to have the possibility that the personal information leaks out. I am the same as the opinion of this person and think that it is necessary to argue to find a better method to keep the balance."
NBE03618,"The present age is risk society. In global Internet society, leaked information can't stop diffusing. We should use the Internet from an understanding of that. Certainly, "" the right to be forgotten"" is usability. But, I believe freedom of expression should be absolute in democratic government. By reason of that, first, we understand the risk involved with Internet society. It is the most rational attitude, I think."
NBE03617,"I agree with you. It may make more sense for someone to understand the Internet's risk. ""Right to be forgotten"" is of limited effectiveness for privacy. We should avoid excessive expectations. It is rational way of thinking."
NBE03655,"I think ""the right to know ""should be more respected than ""the right to be forgotten"". To begin with, the major role of mass media such as, TV newspaper internet site etc, is surveillance of the authority . If ""the right to be forgotten""were so esteemed, the role of mass media as the observation would be feeble. If it were not for the surveillance, politicians would behave at their own sweet will. To begin with, in democratic society, the person who create the country is the citizen. To create a country, they need a tremendous amounts of information. For , without information, they don't know what to do. So to create sound democratic society, we should value ""the right to know""."
NBE03678,"When I read the article ""Google agrees to forget"", I commented that I think privacy should be respected and individuals should be able to erase data that they no longer wish to be in public. Of course, I still think protecting individuals' privacy is important. However, I realized that if it was admitted legally to erase information on the Internet, individuals, companies and so on may erase their past indiscretions and conceal something wrong for them. I don't think it isn't good that the weak of information increasingly come not to be able to access to important information."
NBE03631,"The world has been small recently and the Internet has been used all around the world. We can get every kind of information easily, for example social, political, cultural and of course personal. Thinking of this situation, it is needless to say that there is danger. In order to avoid risk, some action is taken, I hope."
NBE03648,"I think that there are always conflicts between opponents and defendants as long as laws are to defend one's right . For example, if laws would be set up to defend ""Hate Speech"", it faces the problem that it might be against the right to free of expression. Like this conflict, this problem have similar conflict. If laws would be made to regulate the right to forget, it would be against people's right to know. Thus it is only natural that when some has advantage the other has disadvantage. We should consider both sides as much as possible."
NBE03647,"I disagree with this opinion. In this opinion, we should protect our personal right even if we cannot have the right to know. So when we think only about the personal right, we are to neglect the right to know everything that we wanna know. When we judge the matter about politics, politicians and economy, a lot of information need."
NBE03657,"In the present age, we became able to change much information by the Internet in a shorter time. It is what you should be pleased with very much and thinks that it is that life becomes rich that the world becomes convenient. However, I include much risk. The damage by the Internet increases. I feel that we should use the Internet after having understood it enough. More world may become convenient, but attention is more necessary from now on."
NBE03627,"I think the right to be forgotten is necessary to some extent because our shameful information on the Internet may exert a harmful influence on our career or daily lives. However as this article says, we have to reconsider the way to protect people. Overprotection of the privacy may lead the restriction on our right to know . Government of each country should play a key role in a work to reconsider who is really in trouble and what help they really need and balance our 2 rights, right to know and right to be forgotten."
NBE03639,"I agree with you. In fact, we cannot do anything without using the Internet. An advance of the Internet helps us to live in comfortable, but it will be possible to cause troubles such as an infringement of privacy. I think privacy is more important than the right to know. However, this problem is difficult, so we have to think about it prudently."
NBE03641,"Your opinion is interesting. I can understand what you think. The right to know is required, when we search something in detail. However, I think in terms of danger of the Internet, we must protect own privacy, so the right to be forgotten is more important than the right to know."
NBE03642,"I think the right to be forgotten is necessary for us, because we have to protect our privacy information by ourselves. The Internet is very useful and we can search everything we want to know. So, there is a danger that someone gets our privacy information through the Internet. Therefore, we need the right to be forgotten to protect us from the danger."
NBE03660,"I think ""right to be forgotten"" is needed in this information society. This is because it is easy to make our some information reveal on internet. However if the law which admits ""right to be forgotten"" is made , we will have two problems. One is that we cannot learn from our mistakes because our fault can be erased and we can forget something bad. The other is that we cannot use certain public information to set insurance rate. There will be no evidence which guarantees us. So eventually, we have to manage our information by ourselves until the law which makes us protect is made."
NBE03658,I think these kind of punishments is needed. My teacher in elementary school was arrested a couple years ago and you can still search for him on the Internet. There is no privacy on the Internet. This is the serious problem but controlling information is close to surprising the freedom of speech. Therefore we have to control our information by ourselves.
NBE03667,"The Internet has both good aspects and bad aspects. One of good aspects is we can find out what we want to know speedily. On the other hand, bad aspects are, for example, that we are put at risk that we may be known our private data unwillingly. I think the latter aspects are more important because they are sometimes related to our life. We can stoke somebody by using the Internet. To protect people, I think it is necessary to emphasize more on right to be forgotten than on right to know."
NBE03619,"I think this problem can not be concluded simply. Because in private information, right to be forgotten should be admitted. While, public one should not be erased. However, distinguishing private information clear from public one is very difficult, so blanketing right to be forgotten is difficult in realistic decision. All we have to do is being careful when we write in Internet site."
NBE03656,Internet is essential for modern people. Internet is the base of our life and has the influence for the world. I think that perfect protection of privacy is impossible thing by the existence of internet at present. The important thing is how not to our information to the internet. You had better give up deleting our information thoroughly.
NBE03664,"I think it is very difficult problem to resolve because we want both freedom of expression and privacy. However, to keep this balance is very difficult, so I think we should make some efforts to protect us by ourselves partly. For example, we should understand literacy of the Internet surely before we use the Internet. If needed, it is nice idea that schools teach their students it because the Internet must be the main tool for us to get the information in the future. We shouldn't think it is natural that our rights are protected."
NBE03626,"I think privacy problems cannot be solved. It is because privacy problems is relevant to the right to know. If privacy is protected, the right to know is not protected and if the right to know is protected, privacy is not protected. In order to solve this problems, we should define that how much privacy should be protected and the right to know should be protected."
NBE03663,"I disagree with your comment because I think we shouldn't leave the responsibility completely to the government. Maybe we cannot avoid the world where people use the Internet to get the information in the future. So we shouldn't think it is terrible but should think how we can use it well. For that, each of us should understand the literacy of the Internet surely and protect us by ourselves as well as the government do for us."
NBE03625,I disagree with your opinion. I think we cannot compare right to know with privacy.
NBE03645,"It is very difficult to define a difference between privacy and freedom. So we must think this problem more severely. I know the man was blamed on Internet , and this comment has been remaining."
NBE03620,"As I wrote before, I think Americans do not understand what freedom of speech is and how it works. Freedom of speech is one of the way of exercise the right of resistance under natural law. And we make use of it, when the government oppress our fundamental rights, life liberty and poverty. But in this case, whose natural rights or constitutional rights are violated by the government? there is no violation. But the right of privacy is the matter of the relationship between individuals, not between subject or people and government. So in this case the privacy must be the top priority."
NBE03653,I agree to your opinion. I was never involved such a internet problem too. But internet is very important for us. So we need to understand how to use it correctly and pay attention not to being involved such a problem.
NBE03673,"The internet is certainly convenient, but it is very dangerous. I think privacy is important. Although there is an aspect that privacy invade free speech, we should protect privacy in order to guard individual information."
NBE03635,"Privacy and right to know are very important for us. So this problem is difficult to solve. In my opinion, right to be forgotten is needed because privacy is related to trust."
NBE03715,"When I read this article at first, I thought that it is unbelievable and horrific that there still are old-fashioned things such as human trafficking and slavery. But, thinking more deeply, I realized that this situation is no ""old-fashioned"" at all. We know that globalization has enabled us to communicate with people all over the world, every nation to ""connect"" with each other in terms of culture, economy, politics, social systems. But we often overlooked the fact that it has made a mechanism where rich countries force poor countries to produce things at very low cost. In such mechanism, it is very natural that poor countries are driven to using people as a cheap labor (and such people are likely to be those captivate or criminals). What we can do is to understand that globalization has pros and cons. we cannot be blind to bad aspects it has. And this news is one of the such aspects."
NBE03708,"I was shocked very much. I have to make sure the goods we buy are free from forced labor to save them. However it's difficult for me to check the suppliers of what I buy, so I don't know what I should do."
NBE03743,"Japan needs to think not only of overseas but also of a domestic forced laborer. Japan is estimated as Tier 2. It is because Japan is an international hub of human trafficking and child pornography. Moreover, the foreigner of the illegal stay is working in a horrific condition. Since TVPA is the report of study which the United States decided independently, it is not necessarily exact. Of course, Japan government, retailers, and supermarket chain must take action, in order to save people who be held against their will in Thailand or Qatar, etc. However, Japanese people must not ignore a domestic labor problem."
NBE03725,"When I read this news, I was surprised that human traffic and Egyptian bondage continued being left. I think that this is one of the problems that we should think about all over the world. Globalization advances in the developed country and becomes convenient with various aspects, but , on the other hand, it is surely a fact that such a thing is yet up in an invisible place. I think that it is to be wrong to treat the person of the underdeveloped country as a slave because a developed country holds down production cost and think that it is that anyone knows it. However, it is reality to have to work under such situation because life enters them. Therefore the people of the developed country pay its attention to such a bad aspect well and think that we should make an effort to be improved for them."
NBE03685,"It is bad for companies in developed countries to take mean advantage of migrants' poverty. Human trafficking and slavery make light of human rights. Companies in a developed country often build a factory in order to reduce labor costs. It is no exaggeration to say they take advantage of poverty. Companies have to give employees fitting compensation for their labors. On the other hand, companies have to seek profit. A capitalistic economy caused this problem."
NBE03690,"When I first read this article, I was very shocked and surprised to know the reality that there are still forced workers treated in horrific conditions. We can get various food produced all over the world and such globalization made our lives more convenient. On the other hand, we have to try to change the situation for slave labors as soon as possible. The human trafficking is terrible thing and I feel very sorry for those who got degrading treatment. We often hear the commercials that say consumers can buy things at cheap prices, but such global retailers might cause more and more slave workers! I think companies in Thailand and Qatar are likely to focus on reducing the cost and seethed with anger at the Qatari government's attitude that they did not respond to a request for comment about the issue. This kind of news might have great effect on buying and I think we have to make better environment which allows workers to live as ""human beings""."
NBE03736,"Reading this article, I was very shocked and was surprised the harrowing situation. It is not too much to say that this is the age of capitalism. So, on one hand i can understand the thoughts of the managers;on the other hand , in terms of humanitarian, I cannot tolerate their attitude toward the slavers. Like us, they are humans . We humans can only think of others with the kindly heart. And they all have the human right. So, to solve these problems, we have to turn our eyes on them no matter how terrible it may be."
NBE03691,"Many people say "" the situation is horrible"", however, we must recognize that we have forced to make the situation. We have wanted low price products and forced producers to do so. We should blame not only producers, but also ourselves. Protecting the human right is very important, of course, however we should start from recognizing our responsibility. And I think the best way to protect people like written in this article is that the international organization like WHO enact laws legislate against labor force."
NBE03742,I was very shocked reading this news. I actually feel there are a lot of people who is used as a slave. Foods we have every day relate many slaves. A government should make strict law to top of the company which force them work under terrible condition.
NBE03711,"I was surprised and shocked, as reading this article. Because I didn't imagine that slavery is still left . People who forced working conditions like slavery are too bad to live. I suppose these companies are going to hold down price of products, so they introduced slavery. But it is wrong to introduce slavery. I read the working condition of slaves, I think we should make a company cease to forced working under bad conditions as soon as possible. If companies want to cut cost of employees, they should think not to force migrant workers into work in the bad condition but to come up with other way to cut another point of cost. Although many countries know the news, the problem don't solve. I suppose that they should struggle to solve the problem in cooperation with each other. And we should tell the fact to many people in order to oppose to the company which introduce the slavery. Moreover governments make a strict rule of working condition to save human right. The economy and government are connected with other countries. This problem is related to Japan and also other countries. So we should tackle this important problem to solve , thinking as our problem."
NBE03722,"I was surprised at the true that there is a terrible situation of forced workers. I cannot understand the manager's attitude toward the slavery. However, it is also a problem for us. The people of developed countries have to take action to resolve such a problem. I think that developed countries treat the people of underdeveloped countries as a slavery in order to they holds down production cost. We must treat the people all over the world as human beings. I have a strong desire that when we spend equally comes."
NBE03700,"When I read this article for the first time, I was very shocked and surprised at the reality that there are still forced workers treated in horrific conditions like as slaves. This problem is related to Japan and also other countries. So we should consider the solution strategy of this problem and make world wonderful."
NBE03693,"I was surprised at the fact that there were still people who worked in a severe condition. I think every workers should be treated equally. In Japan, we do not attach great importance to slavery, because we never have such forced labor and we think we have nothing to do with this. However, nations have become globalized and we should take part in this problem positively. Appealing importance of human life is one of the best ways, I think."
NBE03689,"I was surprised that there is still labor slave and terrible work condition cause dead people. I think government should protect people who are working too match. Although it isn't easy to improve the working condition, government have to do something. How about make law about work, for example, make minimum wages rule or regulate work time. I think those law will improve working condition a little."
NBE03713,"I felt that it was really terrible to know the severe actual situation and working conditions of the forced labor and the forced prostitution. And I was surprised how human rights are ignored so much today of the 21st century. In order to defeat such situation, it is important to remove faulty consciousness and corruption of the government, and we consumers choose the product consciously and what kind of non-humanitarian thing is performed in the world."
NBE03734,"When I read this article, I was shocked that there are still situations that people are force to work with no payment all over the world. People have the right to live equally and no one can deny it. To cope with this problem, what we can do is to make sure the goods we buy are free from forced labor when we are shopping. I also think that consumers should bear some responsibility for combating the trafficking business as this article said."
NBE03730,"I was surprised that there are still forced workers treated terrible conditions like slave. In Japan such a situation is unbelievable. But may be there is some responsibility for us. because We have wanted products with low price and forced producers to do so. Before considering about this problem, we should realize our responsibilities."
NBE03696,"We the Japanese basically enjoy our peaceful life, so we tend to think there is no human trafficking or slavery any more. However, there still are such kind of things outside Japan. Everyone has a right to live freely and equally regardless of the nationality. We the Japanese should take an active part in spreading such thoughts all over the world."
NBE03733,"I think it is nice idea to make human trafficking watch list. However, watch list is able to have only limited effect on the whole world. Then, I hit on two solutions to help labor victims improve their statuses. First solution is to establish the international watchmen and lawyers institution who specialize in labor problem. This institution in non Government Organization. The institution help the unethical business victims win labor disputes and labor trials Moreover, the institution encourage employees and labor slaves to set up their labor union. Therefore, it is easier for workers to demand employers and parent companies make better labor environments. Second solution is to organize small and medium sizes businesses which have more ethical and secure systems. This businesses will be supported by related big companies. Then, The companies try achieving economical superiority over the companies run by trafficking and unethical labor. For example, Improving quality and reducing cost by eliminating the waste of transportation help them attract more consumer. If they accomplish to have the better status in wholesale market than unethical companies, slave work has been abolished perfectly. However my suggestions seems hard to carry out. First of all, it is not clear who and which organization pay much money to begin the two propositions. Consequently, it is important to keep watch countries where trafficking businesses thrive, and to reconsider the more efficient and ethical way to help labor slaves liberate from unethical companies."
NBE03738,"I had known that many people're forced to work in inferior condition in developing countries , but I knew how cruel the working condition is at first when I read this article. I think TIP report is playing a significant role in the movement of anti-trafficking , but it is not enough to eliminate slavery and trafficking issues perfectly because it is impossible for TIP to investigate the worst working condition in each country. I suppose that trafficking issues is one of the most important problems we have to think consciously because we tend to miss this problem behind a lot of serious problem such as an environmental problem and the North-South problem."
NBE03728,"I have regarded the human trafficking as old habit. However it is not old habit any longer, it is ongoing problem we are now facing. I was shocked and also felt ashamed of not knowing the fact. We, especially the Japanese live in the affluent society. However, the social background of this is so serious. We always tend to forget that the food we easily get may be produced by modern-day slavery who work everyday at low costs. We should think of the two aspects and consider what we can do for them."
NBE03703,"I was surprised that there were many people who worked as slaves in the terrible conditions. We, Japanese, do not know this fact and will have no chance to know because they are not interested in such problems. For Japanese, even if the working conditions are more and more worse, they have nothing to do with this fact. At first, we should have concern about it in order to solve. We must not turn our eyes away this problem."
NBE03682,"People in developing countries are not aware of this situation. We have regarded human rights as one of the important things that we should respect. But we have always made sure of these rights between people and the government sometimes as conflict. But from now on, we have to protect the rights of other countries' people through border lines. However, especially Japanese have never introduced slavery. For example, in man'yoshu, the oldest the oldest existing collection of Japanese poetry, there are poetries of the emperor and those of homeless, too. So we have respect the human dignity of people who are in bat economical situations. Therefore other countries' people stand completely different backgrounds. So we, including me, may not understand how hard labor who are held by someone because of they are poor or sometimes not having citizenships. I think there is two solutions to make the situation of Thai's labor better. We should import Thai's goods more. This may seen as the way promoting bad situations more, but without enough monetary base. They cannot mend payments of all the jobs in Thai. And we should also introduce our industry to Thai. By doing so, we can create the job with much payment and good working environments. Japanese as the same Asian people will be the key."
NBE03705,"When I read this article, I was very surprised. This news is unbelievable. I thought trafficking was a thing of the past. As I didn't know the fact, many people don't know it and consume them. We must not overlook it. We must know it and make it known to many people. Consumers also promote such problem. Consumers should know the fact and change their actions."
NBE03745,"When I read this article, I was very shocked and surprised that there still are old-fashioned things such as human trafficking and slavery. I think We should help to improve the situation."
NBE03684,"I think the ranking according to countries' willingness and efforts to combat trafficking and slavery is good for stop human trafficking, but it should contain the actual situation which slaves in. We should know their job in fishing boats is so rigorous. Also, in Japan, we should know our eating is supported by slaves and make effort to stop human trafficking."
NBE03735,This news was read and I was shocked very much. But I regarded me as shameful. It is because I cannot stop continuing receiving the benefit of globalization simultaneously We have the tendency to see only the good field of globalization. The foolishness is made to notice the slavery issue of Qatar. I think that it is a subject of us who live in advanced nations to help the workers who work under an unusual situation across a country. there were slaves in the back side where goods are enjoyable with budget prices . It is necessary to consider what we should do for stopping this negative chain.
NBE03720,"When I read this article, I was shocked very much. We cannot check the situation of the work like the slave. However, I should be able to cause some action. I do not know what I should do now, but do not begin when I do not think. I may cause a big change if I begin it because it is small."
NBE03683,"I was surprised that human trafficking is present still. I am the opposite to human rights violations. However, political issues are involved in this problem. I strongly believe these issues and must be solved worldwide. I hope that such problems are resolved quickly."
NBE03694,Slaves are still used . This fact shocked me and made me feel sad. We should abolish these slave systems.
NBE03717,"Reading this article , I was surprised at the horrific situation and was indignant at it. In terms of the managers and the chief executive, I can understand that they have to cut their worker's wage, but from the opposite point of view, that is, in terms of humanitarian, we cannot tolerate the situation. It is no exaggeration to say that this is the ""murder"". To save them from that situation, we should understand the situation fundamentally and have to address it over a long period of time"
NBE03695,I think the circumstance is very cruel and bad thing. Forced labor damages people's dignity and human rights. The action should be censured more and people have to consider the forced labor problem. Why has substantial slavery lost even present time? We should treat the serious problem while taking account of the condition and human rights.
NBE03712,"Reading Supermarkets tied to slave labor in shrimp industry and this article, I was very surprised that in the world, there are a lot of people treated as slavery and I do not that fact in detail. Before reading this article, I thought that now few people are treated so, but in fact , such a bad environment still remains. We must try to save them and know some of what we buy and use are at the cost of their lives. Moreover, governments should make place where these people can tell a lot of people that what happens in their working place. and The mass media have to report it more on a large scale."
NBE03729,I agree with the opinion that not only producers but also ourselves like consumers have responsibility.
NBE03740,"I was so surprised and hurt my heart to see the article. Some of our daily foods are based on slave labor. What is wores, the environment of slave labor is so terrible. I think what we can do as consumer is to stop buying the commodities which use slave labor to make it."
NBE03741,"The boycott will make the company which use slave labor reexamine their system and improve the condition of worker, as not slaver."
NBE03706,"When I read the article, I was very shocked because I can't believe there are many forced workers for no pay, and under threat of extreme violence. In almost all nations in the world, the fundamental human rights are respected, and in many cases, this sentence is clearly written on their own constitutions. In other word, we take it for granted that we should respected human rights and human dignity. However, according to the article, human rights are ignored openly. In order to protect the creed of ""respect for fundamental human rights"", authorities, like UN, should take measures against the issue."
NBE03714,"I agree with your opinion. What is needed is that we have two points of view-one is of executives and capitalists, and the other is of workers who are even now in that horrific situation!"
NBE03732,"When I read this news, I was surprised that human traffic continued being left. Everyone in the world should has a right to live freely and equally regardless of the nationality. I think we should take movement like such thoughts all over the world."
NBE03680,"In an increasingly globalized world, we take a high toll on poor people unthinkingly. We must face up to stark reality. We must take steps in order to solve. I'm going to buy nationally produced products. And, Japanese government should remonstrate in an emphatic manner."
NBE03701,"I have never thought about human trafficking problems until I read this article. The point I sympathized most is that consumers should also bear some responsibility for combating the trafficking business. Without our attempts, this problems can't be solved forever. From now on, I also make sure the goods I buy are free from forced labor."
NBE03744,I was shocked and ashamed that I hadn't knew the fact that the eating habits of the Japanese is based on slave labor. I think that the Japanese Government should help Thailand and Qatar and any other nations which have human trafficking and slave labor problems to improve these problems. Japanese have responsibility for it because we are reaping the benefits from these nations.
NBE03710,"When I read this article at first, I was shocked and surprised. Because in the world I have thought that human trafficking do not exist and this matter is the ancient problem . In addition to this, this problem is caused by the fact advanced countries are racking the developing countries. People in the developing countries are forced to work at lows wages. We usually use the product which is good for the cheap price. It owes to the people at low wages. Thus we in advanced countries should think about this matter seriously."
NBE03692,"I think so, too. I was also shocked and surprised when I read this article. Slavery should be disappeared. This problem happened in the country far from Japan. However, we must not pretend not to see but think together and take some action."
NBE03709,I agree with this opinion strongly. It is because this human trafficking problem in developing countries is connected with Japan deeply. However most Japanese don't know about this problem. This is the most worst thing. I think ignoring is the most shameful thing. We should have interests for more things especially connecting our surroundings.
NBE03719,"I disagree with this opinion. I think that we must consider about forced labor. Of course, the system called the slave is prohibited. However, people of the world understand that the slave is so bad system, such situation does not happen. We have to consider more."
NBE03688,"It is unmistakable fact that slave labor in Thailand and Qatar is inhumane and bad and we buyer of the products which are made by slave laborers are responsible for this problem. However, I think it is little strange that the U. S solely interfere in the problem of Thailand and Qatar aggressively. In the case like this, non national organization should play a key role. If one strong country interfere, the problem is likely to be controlled to be profitable for that country and not to be solved for a long time."
NBE03704,"When I knew the fact there are the people who work as slaves, I couldn't believe the fact. We have to abolish slavery. However, it is impossible to solve this problem by individual effort. So, I think we need International cooperation to solve this problem. I believe that the good idea to solve this problem will come out if the people all over the world consider carefully and discuss about this problem. I wish slavery will disappear from this world."
NBE03724,"I was shocked when I read this article. I do not know that slaves are forced to work in Thailand and Qatar until I read this. In Japan, our rights to work with our intentions are protected. Other countries people are the same human beings as Japanese. So they also have human rights like that. Therefore I think these slavery in Thailand, Qatar and other countries must be prohibited and abolished. Moreover in order to eliminate it, we have to look for the way to do so and continue to make every effort."
NBE03723,I strongly agree with you. I also think we have responsibilities for it and should realize and consider. What we can do first is not to buy products made by slaves.
NBE03721,"In the 21st century, all peoples should be given the fundamental human rights. We must respect the human rights. So shall we stop buying the products made by slaves? A boycott! We should show our opinion by action. And we will stress the owners."
NBE03731,"When I read this article, I was so surprised and feel that I'm happy in that I was born in Japan. Japan is so peaceful, freedom, and rich country than other countries. If I were to born in a foreign country which is developing, I might be a slave. Now I know that I'm happy, I should do something to poor people."
NBE03681,I didn't think the world working situation is so terrible. This is not domestic problem but global problem. It's necessary for all the countries of the world to cooperate in slave labor conditions.
NBE03718,I think it is great advance that developed countries come to concern the condition of developing countries' people. The thing that developed countries should do next is to resolve the condition of them and protect their rights. I hope that these problem will resolve in the future.
NBE03727,"When I read the article first I was very shocked, and I thought we, every Japanese people should know the fact. Because, for example, our clothes especially "" ""fast fashion"" made in these countries. Now it is natural for us to buy ordinary clothes at a very low price, but almost all of us don't know where and how they are made. I don't think we have to avoid buying them, but we should know the fact and move to improve their environment. I think it is our responsibility."
NBE03726,"I strongly agree with your comments, because I also think in the world there is a mechanism that rich countries force poor countries in a lot of terms. I think appealing this mechanism is natural, but we must not overlook it. We, living in ""rich"" countries have some responsibility to improve the situation by thinking human rights and morality deeply."
NBE03687,"I think it is so problematic for us to use the system of forced labor. We should do away with the system. In order to do so, we think better of the modern world system. In Japan, there is not the system of forced labor, but in the world there is still the system. we should dispense with the system."
NBE03686,I agree with your opinion. I think the modern condition should be improved.
NBE03707,"When I read this article, I was shocked that forced labor is remaining at this peaceful age. We must abolish this shameless labor system, so we should buy thing free from slave labor."
NBE03716,"I was very surprised at the fact there are still slave labor in many countries. So we must make sure the goods we buy are free from forced labor. But to tell the truth, we can't tell goods to buy from them not to buy. It cannot be helped that we want to buy cheaper, after all we maybe buy the former. So I'm sorry but the slave labor must remain."
NBE03737,"I am impressed by this line: Slavery rips and tears at the fabric of the rule of the law. We constructed solid idea for human rights as far, but slavery destroy this idea. Slavery don't give benefit all the countries. Slavery should be banned."
NBE03699,I strongly agree with you. I also think that appealing importance of human life is one of the best way. We should think about human rights to live in the world.
NBE03697,I wish all slaves would be released. My heart aches for their suffering.
NBE03698,Wonderful consideration ! I'm impressed with your comment to globalization.
NBE03702,"Above all, I was surprised that there are slave labors forced to work on agriculture or fishery for no pay in this world. Also, I was more surprised that there are human trafficking market in the current situation. I do not want to work for no pay and be have dealings on human trafficking market. I should be deeply grateful to my circumferent environmental and must to think about slave labor to save them from unfair working."
NBE03739,"I don't agree with this opinion. Of course it is important for us to criticize such an action, but that's not enough to solve this problem perfectly. I suppose we have to make more effort to solve this problem, for example, not to buy the trafficking commodity and contribute some money to them."
NBE03810,"When I hear the news, I became angry to the lack of consciousness about women's standpoint. However, the action of throwing eggs was incorrect. We should control our feelings and careful what one says and does at any time."
NBE03816,"I think that political corruption in the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly was exposed by this problem. Akihiro Suzuki heckled rashly not thinking how Ayaka Shiomura is feeling. Moreover He told a lie that he hadn't heckled. They are disgraceful actions as a human. However, throwing eggs at his office was incorrect and not wise way of protesting. It's a childish action and disgraceful, too."
NBE03792,"I was shocked when I heard the news. I cannot his sexist heckling. He cannot understand what politicians should do for the people in Japan. Becoming politicians means representative of the people. Therefore, they should work hardly for the people. I do not want the people like him who has no responsibility as politicians. I can understand the action of throwing eggs. I think that it means anger of women. However, they had better to be more calm and consider how to represent their anger."
NBE03815,"The consciousness reform about a woman is required in Japan. Although the Abe Administration and the Liberal Democratic Party are assist female activity by means of only words, there is little actual action. Ms. Shiomura had sued this problem for Parliament. However, she was insulted. This case clarified that sex discrimination was very strong, although democratization spread in Japan. Probably, not only the Japanese but overseas' people was disappointed. In the present social system women will be unable to engage to work and raise their children simultaneously. The Japanese male should get to know a woman's difficulty, and should change recognition."
NBE03764,"I think lawmakers who heckled Ms. Shiomura should apologize her and all women properly. Why do they say such insulting remarks even the social advancement of women has become common in the world? Statements like ""Hurry up and get married"" and ""Can't you have a baby?"" are very rude for women who can't get married and keep doing infinity treatment. The circumstance that sexism hasn't vanished in Japan makes me angry. Some men disdain women and blame later marriages and infertility in Japan yet, but I want them to say that women bear men including them."
NBE03775,"I know this news before reading this article. Akihiro Suzuki shouldn't have shouted ""Hurry up and get married"" and ""Can't you have a baby?"" at her. Not only women but also men have responsibility for the problem of the declining birth rate. A woman can't have a baby without a man. So, men also have responsibility. It is difficult to solve this problem, but we have to solve this problem as soon as we can."
NBE03794,"I felt Ayaka Shiomura was poor because Akihiro Suzuki told her such a terrible thing. I agree with mass-media that made this matter big. If we don't know that case and make it controversial, she probably cannot be apologized by him. However there is a man who made such remarks. Moreover I thought there are many people who were heckled so badly. So I suggest that lawmakers should make a law that prohibit heckling like this, and also the government should proceed with the Gender Equality to eliminate such a sexist heckling."
NBE03758,"I have known this news before because remarks made by lawmakers have become focus of intense media interest. When I first hear this news, I was very shocked as a woman. Our country, Japan is not as equal between men and women as other countries, such as Iceland, Finland and Norway. According to this article, the Prime Minister Shinzo Abe promises to boost the role of working women, however, I think it takes very long time to achieve the words. Needless to say, the situation that there are men who jeer toward women should be improved promptly. In this news, it was the worst action for Akihiro Suzuki not to apologize at first. I think all of the lawmakers have to be more responsible as leaders of many people in Japan. In my nearly future, I am going to work after graduating from Keio university, so I hope such situation would be better than now. Anyway, we all have to understand that women don't have equality of status with men, and reconsider what we should perform in our society."
NBE03753,"I watched the news that a Diet member jeered a sexist heckling. It is true that heckling was regarded as a trademark of Diet. However, sexist heckling became permissible as times change. Therefore, we should watch our language about especially discrimination against women. On the other hand, lawmakers' jobs are to make laws. Their jobs are not looking for the culprit. I desire for my heart that they do their original jobs."
NBE03806,"I knew this news since before having learned it by a class. The sexual harassment in the workplace becomes the social problem today. In the situation, it is a very deplorable thing that a politician left economy of Japan to had the issue of sexual harassment. My friend received sexual harassment from a school teacher before and changed school. Therefore, for such a problem, I cannot help hiding anger. I want Representative Suzuki to resign as a politician as soon as possible. However, I want him to pay the special attention not to cause such a problem if he remain a politician."
NBE03800,"In Japan, we haven't take the problem ""sexual harassment"" so seriously. I think this case had often occurred till lately in Japan, so some people may think that it is surprising that this case was taken so seriously. However, in foreign countries, I think sexual harassments are very taboo. Now, it is said to be important that women should work equally to men, we should also take it important how women can work comfortably."
NBE03783,"I can't forgive his remark. ""Can't you have a baby?"" This comment is the worst for every woman which they can't have a baby. I was shocked , hearing this comment. People have any troubles and worries, so he have no right to say like that. Although a lot of Japanese women are forced to work and keep house at the same time, a lot of Japanese men only work and don't keep house at the same time. Abe's policy of economy is welcomed, however there is more important point of helping and increasing the birth rate. That point mean systems of equal balance of keeping house between men and women. When I study the problem of a declining birthrate, many woman would like to work. So government should not only help their economy but also make the systems that woman can work comfortably. Many women think If they have a baby, they can't work. A government should make companies make a system which not only women but men can take a child care rest more easily."
NBE03799,"In Japan, there was a culture that men work mad women do housework. I think the basic cause of low birth rate is this culture. Recently Japanese women began to work in office. But they have to balance her works and housework. On the other hand, men only work and don't do housework. This is problem. It is natural that women think if she has a baby, she can't work. So government should make a system that women can work more comfortably, for example system that men can take rest for taking care of his baby easily. And it is also necessary that men understand more about difficulty of women's balance of works and housework."
NBE03747,"Treating men and women equally is timeless agenda for Japan. The convention of ancient times, predominance of men over women still exists in parts of Japanese society. The idea that men only work and the women do housework is one of it. Japanese government should do two things. As the stage of women's advance into society has been practically arranged, in the next place they should create a nurturing environment. And besides they should also offer the environment to go back easily after child rearing."
NBE03812,"The words ""Hurry up and get married"" and ""Can't you have a baby?"" are prejudice and criticism Japanese women working as a career woman. And, I can't understand why Akihiro Suzuki lied that he didn't make such remarks. I want him to have a responsibility as a politician. Japan behind other countries in terms of sexual equality. A government should establish concrete policy. However, it's not good to consider prepare only woman's environment for work because men and women work together. I hope people work without thinking about gender."
NBE03752,"When I heard this news, I felt depressed about Mr. Suzuki's heckle. Also, I thought that this heckle was what cannot be helped because Ms. Shiomura didn't have husband and baby. Eventually, government have all responsibility for help women who working in the society. They should establish policies, for example, completeness of childcare leave and increase of childcare center."
NBE03756,"I was very surprised and felt sad to read this article. We have various points of view respectively, which is quite natural, but we have to make a distinction between the thing which is proper to say and the thing which is improper to say clearly. By the way, I agree with the government's plan to encourage women to go into society much more too. However, as Ms. Shiomura says, the impact of the government's action don't appear enough so far. I think the government should give more power to each prefecture to be able to make an action of promoting women's advance originally."
NBE03795,"When I watched this news, I felt anger in the remark of this man. This is because I could not believe that such a person making a discriminatory remark still exist in Japan though we thought to support a woman spreads out. Of course I agree to a thought of Prime Minister Abe, but think that there is not any meaning that only he insisted on. We spread his thought to more people and think that what We and he do is important for Japan that there is not of such a remark being given twice."
NBE03785,"I think that the old generation of men looks down on women very much. And I felt that men forces to have children and the responsibility to the declining birth rate society on women. It is natural for politicians not to be able to take part in good politics, for the recognition of them is such a thing. We should do more education to improve the consciousness to women."
NBE03746,"Certainly, the Diet lawmaker shouldn't heckle someone on the bench. They should listen with concentration to make mention. But, I have a matter of great concern. It is that everyone avoids the difficulty resulting from communication. It's kind of sad that we hesitate to become close together. Of course, we mustn't make hurtful gaffe. Akihiro Suzuki is to be held responsible. On the other hands, in ours private life, I think that we need some jokes in communication. Communities without talking are not interesting. I oppose exclusive attitude."
NBE03811,I also became angry hearing this news. I think what people have to do is not to throw eggs but to make Akihiro Suzuki have a responsibility and apologize to Japanese women.
NBE03786,"This news topic is very controversy one, I think. Of course, it is definitely malicious that the men made (sexual) harassments to the lawmaker Shiomura. But I argue that we should stop to think that what constitutes the concept of ""gender free"". What I want to say is that Shiomura, who is also a writer for TV show programs, herself actually do make a terrible sexual harassment, through TV programs, to teenage girls who are eager to be TV stars, taking advantage of their ambition (like "" I do anything if I can be a top idol!) . But curiously, little criticism is made to this fact. What is important is that we should consider the question ""Is it a sexual harassment if men do not respect women? And what if women neglect women's or men's rights and dignity?"" In that point, I felt this news can be valuable discussion topic."
NBE03754,"Equality of the sexes is important, but in Japan, equality of the sexes don't spread. So, what should we do? I think we should eliminate the concept that men and women are different. In this article, the problems include the sexual harassment. If the discriminative concept are eliminated in Japan, the sexual harassment will decrease. Also all over the world, there is the sexual harassment, so we should think about the problems not only in Japan, but also in the world."
NBE03750,"I was shocked more than a little to read this article. I noticed women to have been scorned in Japan still. Abe administration are trying to actively supporting women. Nevertheless, It is a pity that Japanese people will not the unity. I think through this problem, it is good if many people are aware of the importance of supporting women more."
NBE03760,"I was disappointed at this news. I think Akihiro Suzuki should be ashamed of himself. The statement ""can't you have a baby?"" is really heartless. We should not be prejudice against women. It is true that there is a gender equality problem. We should be given equality of opportunity. Japan should follow foreign country's example. I hope women will be completely accepted."
NBE03803,"This news shows sex discrimination has still existed in Japanese society. Ironically, the Diet has been trying to encourage women to play more active part in the society. However, I doubt that this insulting remarks were uttered by Suzuki Akihiro alone. I suspect this impolite event was happened by more than one person. If my assumption were right, there are still some assemblymen who have careless and unconsidered thoughts in the tokyo metropolitan assembly. Nonetheless, because of this matter, assemblymen are made to realize again that the Japanese people are indignant at sex discrimination."
NBE03787,"When I read this news, I was very disappointed. And I think this news shows there is still predominance in Japan. Japan has gained gender equality as , but the idea about gender in its society hasn't changed. A short time ago, a Diet member said "" woman is a child bearing machine. "" We should be shameful about our representatives said such remarkables."
NBE03768,"I was shocked when I heard this news. Akihito's remark to Ms. Shinomura is so cruel. If I were heckled by men such, I would have more misery than anger. This case happened to be treated so big by media because it occurred in a Tokyo city assembly session. However, I think such cases because of prejudice against women happened everywhere in Japan. This case is not an accident. In Japan, the men's prejudice against woman is still rooted deeply. I hope Abe's policy for women will go well."
NBE03767,I was shocked when I heard this news. It is outrageous that a member of the Diet who is the representative of the nation makes jeering of the sexism. I think that Japan cannot catch up with other countries in terms of sex equality because each person's consciousness is not enough. We should make the society which everyone can play an active part without distinction of sex.
NBE03788,"When I hear this condescending remark or attitude, I was very shocked. In Japan , inequalities between the sexes has still been indicated. It may be true that men have more power than woman in terms of physical and anatomical structure but i think women should be superior to men in some case. So to solve the problems like this case, we should remove the men's prejudice against women. Before it becomes unruly."
NBE03781,The sexist jeers against Shiomura is unbelievable for me. Maybe they didn't say because they were really thinking so. I think they were just kidding. However it's never allowed because they hurt Shiomura's feeling. There are still many people who are pretending not to heckle. I strongly hope they will be honest.
NBE03779,"This news is frequently broadcast and all over the TV news. I think this situation shows how presses are interested in the news. Certainly, Akihiro Suzuki's jeers should be condemned and he should be punished. However, I think Ayaka Shiomura, who was shouted the terrible jeers, is getting carried away. According to other newspapers, she also made careless remarks in several situations, for example on her twitter. I can't understand she emphasize the sexist jeers with her eyes closing to her own faults."
NBE03772,"I was angry when I watch this news on TV. I am an woman too so if I were heckled, I old did same thing with Ayaka Shiomura. It is a sexual harassment. That is disgrace of Japanese men. I want environment no male chauvinism. We must think about society of equality of the sexes."
NBE03765,"I think heckling in the congress is a kind of Japanese tradition, however, such heckling is not acceptable because he just spoke ill of her. In Japan, man always has had a superiority to woman, so it is naturally hard to spread the idea of gender equality, however, we should try more to do it under the tide of globalization."
NBE03771,I think so too. I think that Akihiro Suzuki should put an end to his job as a member of the Tokyo metropolitan assembly. I was surprised that Akihiro Suzuki did not say true things at first. lying is shameful thing as human. I think that both gender is equally and we should not treat them differently.
NBE03797,"I felt so sad when hear the news. ""Hurry up and get married"" and ""Can't you have a baby?"" , the words by Akihiro Suzuki were the most rudeness words for women. I think that this incident display the fact that discrimination over sex has still existed in recent Japanese society. Moreover, he is a member of Abe's Liberal Democratic Party that insists the necessity of comfortable society for women. I want the Diet reflect on the this accident and don't want to let the women down."
NBE03780,"When I read this article, I don't think that discrimination to women in Japan has finished yet. Indeed, women's status has risen since war, but The custom of male predominance remains firmly. Akihiro Suzuki's remarks mean the discrimination. We should think this problem more seriously ."
NBE03774,"I think Mr. Suzuki's heckling was awful. He should apologize to Ms. Shiomura. This disturbance shows Men and Women are not equal in Japan. Mr. Abe tries to boost the role of working women, but it is not enough. This problem has never been solved. I think the government should formulate concrete policies and take actions."
NBE03819,"When I read this article firstly, I got angry with Mr. Suzuki's heckle. At the same time I think that perhaps my trivial behavior hurt someone's heart, so I decided to care about my behavior."
NBE03790,"When I read this article, I came to feel very deplorable. We should respect the sex without relations each other. We must not do something like this article. It is the topic that is in total sometimes taken up in Japan, but must think as a problem."
NBE03805,"Possibly the utterance ""he should get married early"" became no problem a decade ago. However, it is different now. It is natural that there is a section for sexual harassment in a company. The person in charge is troubled by the interval of a complaint and an excuse every day. i heard the fact from the visitor for my part-time job. Anyway, the utterance which wounds someone should avoid. When it is a parliamentary catcall, it is a quarrel between husband and wife, and it is after"
NBE03778,"I don't think that heckle is good. But I don't support Shiomura's action. A part of heckles can be different from what she and media said. In addition, she spread over the world. I think it is unnecessary."
NBE03796,"I think this news is very terrible. I always think I'd like to work in the future and also gain a happy family. However, hearing the news, I was seized by the fear that I couldn't work comfortably as planned in the Japanese society. It was very disappointed fact for me, and it made me rethink deeply about women in Japan. Japan is very advanced country in the wold, so I think people should feel it is ashamed not to treat women equal to men. We have to rapidly make true gender-equality society with referring to overseas, like Northern Europe."
NBE03804,"When I read this article, I seethed with anger at Mr. Suzuki. Women should be treated equivalent to the men. I hope it easier for women to work and raise children."
NBE03751,I agree with your opinion that Akihiro Suzuki's heckles are disgraceful actions but throwing eggs at his office was not wise way. I think such protesting cause a chain of hatred.
NBE03789,I think this remarks which Akihiro Suzuki said is disgraceful and he disappointed not only Ayaka Simomura but people all over the world. He should be conscious of the thing that he is a member of the metropolitan assembly and watch his mouth. Other people who say the same remarks which Akihiro Suzuki did must apologize for her.
NBE03808,"In this case, Mr. Suzuki is low moral, but Ayaka Shiomura is so , too. Her twitter is example of this case. Recently, Mr. Nonomura is its example. I can't understand these fashion in Japan."
NBE03777,"When I read this article, of course I was so sad. From this case, we can study a lot of things. For example, in this country, there is still sex discrimination. We should remove it from in this country."
NBE03782,"When I read this news, I was very angry. As a woman , If I would be said like this, I would be very sad and hurt. In Japan so many women are eager to work. But they cannot work. So Japan government should make progress on this policy that women can work. In the future, I would like to work very much."
NBE03784,"This news shows that the idea that man and woman are equal is not still spread. Mr, Abe should make effort to improve this situation. AS Shinomura says, Abe's key plank is not real, so he should think another key plank that is more like to come true than that. I think that it is good and important to improve the condition where women can work. for improving Japanese economy."
NBE03802,"When I read this news, I think it is very rude. Mr. Suzuki's heckling was awful. He should apologize to Ms. Shiomura. Mr. Suzuki's remarks mean the discrimination. We should think this problem more seriously. We should try more to do it under the tide of globalization."
NBE03763,I agree with your opinion. Such action is too childish and is based on an inflexible thinking. Men who think that woman should do housework and bear children have to change the thinking.
NBE03757,"I was surprised that politician heckled other one who is women when I read this article, but I think this isn't first time. These days, people are very sensitive to equality of the sexes. So, I think people, particularly who work in public, have to take care the equality carefully. And also I think politician should reconsider that they are elected. I felt that Akihiro Suzuki acted thoughtless. If he took that he was elected to heart, he wouldn't say such a thing. In short, what I want to say is politicians should reconsider those situation, and have to act as such."
NBE03817,"I agree with her comment. I think that Japan is behind the times in terms of sex equality. Actually Japan is 105th in rank of the country which has less gap of sex and is not good environment for women to work. On the other hand, other many countries, for example Iceland, Finland, Norway, and so on, were able to achieve to lessen the gap of sex, so women can appoint to an important post. We should be ashamed of the state of affairs and make efforts to improve it."
NBE03818,"I partly disagree with his comment, because I don't think that Representative Suzuki should resign as a politician. I can understand his mind, but we should not be emotional. If he resign, the problem would be forgotten. It is a loss of chance of improvement of the gap of sex. I hope he continues to work as a politician, and whenever people look at him, they remember this matter."
NBE03791,"These kind of jeerings should not be accepted and allowed. However she should stop mentioning them. Because, He apologized and also Mr, Prime Minister explained the head of MINNANOTOU which Ms, Shiomura belongs to. Why didn't she stop grilling? Due to that, the metropolitan parliament needed to spare times for the jeerings. I think Law makers should think about other issues."
NBE03798,"I strongly agree with your comment. In old Japan, as you said, it is natural that men work and women do housework. But times have changed. In the world, there are now many working women whose achievements are great. Why we don't protect their environment in which they live and work?Also, this problem influences low birth rate. Developing an environment to enable women workers to continue in employment while caring for children or doing housework will be a big theme for Japan's future. Also, I want more and more wen to understand the difficulty of women's balance of works and housework, and help them."
NBE03755,"I strongly agree with your opinion. Even if we have something which we strongly want to express, it is wrong that we think we can or should do anything to express our opinions. We have to consider the way and when to express."
NBE03807,"I sympathize with your opinion very much. Because this politician is the representative whom we nation chose, he must take a right action. Nevertheless, he heckled a woman. This action is an act to betray the nation. Therefore, I think that he should be criticized."
NBE03749,"There are a lot of heckled even in debt in Japan. I think jeers should be excluded from the place of debate. We need only logics, not emotions With logics, they truly debate the matter and reach a constructive suggestion. And, yes it is true that women cannot enjoy enough opportunities of jobs, educations, social status . . etc. Some Japanese said""It is our custom that women support men or do not work and only do houseworks. ""But it is not true. For example, in Kamakura period, girls who are children of samurai warriors can inherited feudal landed property from their parents. And Empress Suiko reigned over and governed Japan. She also send a letter of confirmation of independence. She has a strong authority. And housewives appear in rapid economic growth during the reign of Emperor Showa. It is only 40 years ago. Japanese should confirm the status of women."
NBE03770,"I strongly agree with you! Akihiro Suzuki did disgraceful thing as a human to Ayaka Siomiura. As a women, I was also socked at his saying. His action show today's male chauvinism society. We must rethink this society."
NBE03748,"I think so, too. Her demanding to the prime minister to apologize is not necessary. By doing so, and media focus on it, I fear that the matter of women is forgotten. We should think the status of women, not her performance."
NBE03776,"I agree with you. He is the representative whom we nation chose, so This action is an act to betray the nation. We should remove such person from in this country."
NBE03762,"In developed country , women take part in society like men and do a lot of works . However , in Japan , women can not take part in society as men . Therefore , we should improve women's rights in society ."
NBE03761,I agree with you and I can not understand why he can say such thing too .
NBE03766,"In Japan, women don't have enough wright and protest against this problem is needed more. More and more people should concern this problem."
NBE03769,"I am also disgusted at politician's scandal!!! In addition, I strongly agree with the opinion that Mr. Abe still don't realize his slogan, ""the society woman can play an active part in""."
NBE03820,My opinion is the same as her. I think that the lowness of a male lawmaker's consciousness to a gender equality was exposed. What a pity this condition of the metropolitan government. The politics of Tokyo which will host the Olympic Games in 2020 should have higher consciousness.
NBE03801,"I think that Akihiro Suzuki he and other members of the metropolitan assembly should think of what they say, too."
NBE03813,I think action of Ms. Shiomura is very good. Women should say her opinion to public. She have brave.
NBE03814,"I think so that Mr. Suzuki apologize to people all over the world. He must not say ""I'm a politician. """
NBE03759,"As the time goes by, the peoples' idea of gender is changing. For our father and grandfather generation, its not usual that many people argue the problem of gender like these days. However, we live in this generation are never forgiven to make much of gender problem. We have to face with it every day. Each of us have to take the gender problem into consideration and try to develop the good society"
NBE03793,"I was shocked when I heard the news. I think his sexist heckling should not be allowed. He cannot understand what politicians should do for the people in Japan. Becoming politicians means representative of the people. Therefore, they should work hardly for the people. I do not want the people like him who has no responsibility as politicians. I can understand the action of throwing eggs. I think that it means anger of women. However, they had better to be more calm and consider how to represent their anger."
NBE03809,"When I read this article for the first time, I feel angry at Mr, Suzuki. I wonder why Japanese men don't care Japanese women. I think all men , not only lawmakers should think again how they should care about Japanese women."
NBE03773,"I strongly agree with you! Akihiro Suzuki did disgraceful thing as a human to Ayaka Shiomura. As a women, I was also shocked at his saying. His action shows today's male chauvinism society of Japan. We must rethink this society."
NBE07113,"When I read this article, I was angry. I hope women became to work equally in Japan."
NBE05970,Akihiro Suzuki must always take a right action as a representative of the nation. But he has taken the bad action. He should think about the action that he took and reflection deeply one more.
NBE06630,"The consciousness reform about a woman must be needed in Japan. Although the Abe Administration and the Liberal Democratic Party are assisting female activity by means of only words, there is little actual action. This case clarified that sex discrimination was very strong, although democratization spread in Japan. Probably, not only the Japanese but overseas' people make disappointed. In the present social system women will be unable to engage to work. The Japanese male should get to know a woman's difficulty, and should change recognition."
NBE05558,I was surprised to hear this news. How childish they are. We must not discrimination because of men or women. We should respect each other.
NBE06960,"I read this news before. I think there was not a bit of refinement in Mr. Suzuki's manner. His words, ""can't you have a baby?"" were discrimination against women who can't have a child for sterility and a disease. I also think it was strange he told a lie to protect himself, and to escape his responsibility."
NBE06323,First of all why does discrimination against women exist? We should consider this problem.
NBE06477,"I was shocked when I heard this news. His remark and action were disgraceful. However, I think people who threw eggs had better consider how to express their indignation. Their action was too childish."
NBE05622,"I think sexism like this news is not diminished, and it exists eternally until each man can think about woman equally. I want Japanese men to think again sexual discrimination to hear this news."
NBE06385,"Japanese woman's status is higher than before . But there is reverse discrimination. Sometimes men are discriminated. For example, woman's priority train car."
NBE03827,"I think this problems is so difficult. I understand feelings of independence campaign, but if many independence in Europe became possible, economic, social, institutional and political problems would happen. Therefore I disagree extreme independence campaign."
NBE03822,"I think so, too. If Scotland become independent country, they cannot have independent economy and society from England. So they should stop claiming."
NBE03821,"If Scotland had chosen independence, they wouldn't discommode UK but also Europe countries. World situation is complicated. Freedom of nation from stable state is nearly impossible. I think it was good and wise choice not to independent."
NBE03824,"The problem of separation of country is very difficult and important. In Japan, there is no problem like United Kingdom, but similar thing was happened in country near Japan, Korea and North Korea. The relation between Korea and North Korea isn't good, and also Japan can't have desirable relation. In consideration of the relation of Korea and North Korea, I think it is good choice that Scotland didn't independent. It is because, if Scotland will separate, countries near Scotland, particularly United Kingdom, may make bad relation. So I think it is good choice."
NBE03823,"First, the problem about independence doesn't come to me because it is indifferent in Japan. However, I was very impressed by Mr. Cameron, prime minister of the UK's word, ""Scottish people pass the point of no return if they are divorced from the UK. "" Such as this word, they should think about independence so carefully because if once they independent from the UK, they can't back there."
NBE03825,"I think it is good choice that Scotland would not independent from the UK because if they did that, that would have influence to many area and also that influence to the world economy. So I think their choice is good."
NBE03826,"I think this problems is so difficult. It is an unfamiliar problem for us, Japanese. But it is necessary for us to think seriously. This is because it influences Japan in every scene, for example, economic, social, institutional and political scenes."
NBE03830,"Ebola is nowadays very famous and probably almost all people know this disease. A lot of news tell us about how scary ""Ebola"" is and I think this means that this problem is more and more spreading around the world. When I read this article, I was very disappointed to know that the vast majority of the children affected by Ebola are still left without appropriate care. This is naturally a bad situation and we should make efforts, such as having more knowledge about this disease, reconsidering how people in the hospitals behave, improving health care to increase the number of the treatment centers, and so on. As for staffs in hospitals, I think it is the most important for them to change the way of treatment because this report says ten percent of the dead have been health care workers. Maybe many Japanese people don't care about religion too much, so most of them can't understand the traditional folk remedies very well. However, I think this is the very big factor to cause this terrible situation, so anyway the government in the countries especially where many people have their religion should train nurses. In Manuel Fontaine's comment, ""in some communities the fear surrounding Ebola is becoming stronger than family ties"" made me sad. I believe this is not what human beings are like!!! Even now this is becoming very severe, but volunteers should also have correct knowledge and get trained before reaching affected areas as the report says."
NBE03858,"Today, I heard that a Japanese man who was doubted that he might be infected Ebola was not infected. I was relieved. In Japan, there are also no specific medicines for Ebola, so all we can do to prevent expanding of infection is to seclude the person who is doubted to be infected. I want the medicine will be developed soon. I think that to take childrens' antibodies is good way to make medicines."
NBE03852,"The true that 70% of people infected with Ebola have died surprised me. I was also surprised at the true that 10% of the dead have been health care workers. The dead of Ebola is increasing now. I think that infecting Ebola in the poor nations is the reason that a influence of Ebola's infection does not come to an end. In the poor nations, they cannot take steps to deal with coming Ebola. The lives of people involving Ebola are in danger. I wish that there will be not the dead of Ebola as soon as possible."
NBE03834,"I hope the day will come when Ebola eradicates. In Africa, there are not many hospital facilities and that place is entirely unsanitary, so African people cannot deal with this disease. People all around the world should help them. I think the appearance of an infected person in Japan is a matter of time. Also, I am afraid that Japanese people get into a panic."
NBE03846,"Ebola is known a big problem around the world. The headline made me so sad. Japanese TV and newspaper tell us what Ebola is scared. In other country , people also attention to terrible aspect of the disease. I am also notice the terrible aspect of the disease. And before reading this article, my attention is only how will we prevent from spreading Ebola. But I am noticed there are important problems. Especially, on the article I don't know there are many children who lose parent and they bear grief of losing and fear of Ebola . I know they need not only treatment against Ebola but mental care of orphans. I can't understand medical knowledge , but I try to think about other problem such as mental care of orphans. I learned about having a widely view and many side of problem to one news. The article say 10 percent if dead have been health care workers. That means they need correct knowledge of Ebola . So people around the world go to these arias and teach the way and knowledge of Ebola . That is so good , but they need learning the cultural customs. Although the condition is so emergency, they don't teach the way of treatment one-sided, volunteers should understand their culture's rule and custom before going to the aria."
NBE03851,"I think so, too. I feel fear whenever I see news about Ebola. It is hard to believe a fact happening on this earth to me now. Japan must cause a panic if infection of Ebola happens in Japan."
NBE03847,"I don't know the Japanese man was not infected Ebola . That fact made me relieve too! I agree your thinking that Japan is not also safe so we should prevent expanding Ebola . On the other hands, I don't agree that point which we wait for waiting for developed medicine . I think Ebola is more expanded for many places during waiting medicine . So it is important that each person know fundamental attention of Ebola ."
NBE03855,"Ebola is the big news all over the world. The worried news of the onset spreads almost every day in Japan. The onset is confirmed in many countries other than Japan. While this becomes the big news, it is a fact that effective measures are not hit. Dead people will increase if they do not find measures as soon as possible. Abe and Obama seemed to promise cooperation, but, as well as Japan and the United States, I think that it is the problem that all the countries of the world should cooperate. As time when a big problem occurred, we let you concentrate the techniques of each country, and I think that we should wrestle. Then, a beginning to solution is found and I think that you can get rid of the uneasiness of people of the world."
NBE03845,Ebola news surprised me so much. I have known about this illness few. Thus I did not understand how serious Ebola virus is and how to infect other people. However Ebola developed and spread rapidly to many people. I was thinking that Ebola virus spread in Africa only. I was astonished so much. I hope this pandemic would quiet down in someday.
NBE03859,"Ebola I have been know this word but I didn't think that this virus will pandemic like this. At first, I thought If people in the Africa infected with Ebola, this illness would not to be spreading All over the world without Africa. But my anticipation was different. In the America, Spain infected with Ebola. Ebola virus is more and more close to our life. Perhaps People will infected with Ebola in Japan. We should protect ourselves and know correct knowledge about Ebola."
NBE03853,"Ebola virus has not come to Japan yet, however, there are some Ebola victims in America, so I am fearful and I do not want to go abroad many times from now on. I would like Japan government to make airport inspections strictly. Moreover I feel sorry for orphans because of Ebola. Furthermore 10 percent of health care workers have been suffering from Ebola, so I suggest that they should pay more attention when they change their protecting clothing."
NBE03831,"At first, I also thought that the problem about Ebola was only in Africa and maybe most Japanese people were likely to feel this would not happen in our country, Japan. However, I heard the news that there were possibility the person who had visited Africa was infected the virus. Luckily, this concern wouldn't be true but according to this news, I became more and more worried about the virus. As you says, we should know more about Ebola because we live in the global society."
NBE03864,"After reading this text, I got to know that a child's aftercare was required. Diffusion of an Ebola virus is fearful. Many persons die and orphan children are increasing in number. The child lost parents and is shocked. And also economically, it is in a severe situation. Overseas volunteers expect a doctor are needed. While the peace gets worse, the activity which protects a child is important."
NBE03854,"I also hope that we will not have to be afraid of Ebola in all over the world included the poor nations. I think it is important that we tell the poor nation's people how to prevent from Ebola, each government makes an effort not to expand Ebola into new countries, and that scientists develop a new vaccine."
NBE03839,"I watched news about Ebola, I did not feel fearful at first. However, I heard that there appeared a man who had Ebola in Japan, I think this is not just an affair of other people. We should consider to resolve this crisis in order to prevent from being victim of Ebola. I wish the pandemic will be gone."
NBE03832,"This article says the children who suffer from Ebola was shunned by relatives due to rack of the collect information. Although we can imagine easily that their relatives had strong dilemma, sad and regrets, we can't forgive it in anyway. We have to develop the system of informing and try to decrease the number of the children."
NBE03849,"I studied about Ebola in junior high school. At that time, I had nothing to do with Ebola. But now Ebola is becoming much familiar with me. Globalization makes our lives very convenient. For example, we can easily connect to people all over the world. But maybe we must bear a lot of risks at the same time."
NBE03850,"When I read the article, I felt scary about Globalization. I studied about Ebola in junior high school. At that time, I had nothing to do with Ebola. But now Ebola is becoming much familiar with me. Globalization makes our lives very convenient. For example, we can easily connect to people all over the world. But in contract, maybe we must bear a lot of risks at the same time. We rarely feel such risks in daily life. But there are a lot of risks in front of us. So I think it is necessary for us to recognize this fact."
NBE03856,"At last, the matter of Ebola isn't anyone else's business. The other day, I heard the news one Japanese man fell under suspicion for the decease. I saw the picture the man locked in a clear capsule in the ambulance, which gave me terror of reality. We have to think our protection more real, and never forget there are many people suffered from the decease in a moment."
NBE03857,"I strongly agree with your opinion. We tend to forget when the mass media doesn't pay any attention the news, but in the reality, the problem haven't settled down. We shouldn't forget the fact, and as you said, people all around the world should help people suffered from the disease."
NBE03866,"I fear the Ebola epidemic so much. When I heard the news that the people who had came back to Japan from Africa had a fever and it is likely that they caught Ebola, I thought that finally Ebola has broken out in Japan. I think maybe treatment centers, medical instruments, doctors and nurses are not enough in Africa. I felt sad to hear that people who treated Ebola patients caught Ebola. I think the governments of every countries in Africa which have Ebola patients should take steps to help children whose parents died of Ebola."
NBE03840,"Recently, I see the news about Ebola on TV many times. There are no effective treatment method for Ebola. So, Ebola infection is spreading all over the world. What can we do no to be attacked with Ebola? I think that there are only one thing that we can do not to be attacked with Ebola. It is washing our hands when we come back home. This is very ordinary things, but I think it is important to keep washing our hands."
NBE03863,"The most thing surprised me was that 10% of dead people by Ebola are doctors and nurses who are caring Ebola patients. Ebola is one of the most dangerous problems in the world, so we have to make efforts to resolve this problem. However, we have to make efforts only not to spread Ebola more, but also not to infect doctors and nurses."
NBE03865,"I approve your opinion, too. We should even make the small measure in the house. It's possible to collect contributions in the volunteer group making an effort centering on Africa and a domestic researcher. There isn't an infected patient fortunately in Japan, but that may be only now. Before expecting to be able to help from other countries when a virus came to Japan, it should be decided what one should do. We should acquire knowledge for it. Such small measure is the certain behavior to win the Ebola."
NBE03828,I agree with your opinion. People can get it over as quickly as possible. This Ebola Outbreak is related to us. Governments around the world ought to support this problem.
NBE03844,"When I heard some news for the first time, I can't imagine Ebola occurs to such a pandemic. I had thought Ebola is unfamiliar with our daily life, and we would never fear the virus. However, when I heard the news that a man who came back from Liberia may contract with Ebola, I shrugged. Although the pandemic is drawing to an end, we should care about the news about Ebola."
NBE03862,I am surprised at that situation. The government should protect many children.
NBE03829,"I was shocked at this article. I have already known that Ebola orphans in west Africa is very very serious problem but I had no idea about the situation of children who lost their parents due to the Ebola and how bad the way of looking by non-infected people to those who are infected by Ebola is. On the other hand, I felt very good that UNICEF is working to reunite separated children with their relatives through a nationwide family-tracing network to provide children with psychological support."
NBE03841,"I searched Ebola's photo before. But I watched a grotesque one. It was more than our imagination. After that, I could not have thought Ebola. and when I read this article, I was shocked moreover. That is more than only sickness. All I can do is be able to stop infection. But treatment medical instruments, doctors and nurses are not enough in Africa. We have to rethink a new measure."
NBE03843,"I think so. I think when I heard some news for the first time, I can't imagine Ebola occurs to such a pandemic too. But it is very serious problem. We should attention the news about Ebola."
NBE03842,I think so. But I had no idea about the situation of children who lost their parents due to the Ebola too. It is very serious problem.
NBE03836,"Ebola is the big news all over the world. It is fortunate that an infected person is not yet in Japan. Rumors about the EBOLA hemorrhagic fever to be infected, and to spread walk the one in the Internet. So we don't have to accept a rumor easily and we should learn the right measures method."
NBE03837,"I think so too. Although I can't imagine Ebola, we have to care the news."
NBE03833,"We don't have information about Ebola without medias such as news papers and TV. And they say ""This is very scary and leads us to death easily . However, in developed countries, the rate of the death by this is very low. I think government shouldn't stir up people mind."
NBE03835,"I often hear the news about Ebola recently. It is terrible. I want the day that Ebola would vanish to come. Also, these children should be cared by the government and they should tell residents right information."
NBE03861,EBOLA virus spreads over the world rapidly. I don't also know when Japan is also exposed to a threat of Ebola. Japan should take prevention for the measure. I think relief of an overseas Ebola infected patient should be hurried.
NBE03838,"I hope that Ebola will gathers and bundles. Losing family or loves one is most sorrowful things on the earth. If Ebola came to Japan, Japanese should be calm and do appropriate disposal. We must learn truth about Ebola."
NBE03848,"Some months have passed since Ebola virus spread to west Africa. more people there died by this disease than we have heard from news or radio. When I read this article, I really feel sorry for them, especially children and their relatives. In order to protect Japan from such a situation, Japanese government should take proper action, ordinary."
NBE03867,Ebola is the big news all over the world. I hope this pandemic would quiet down in someday.
NBE03868,"I was surprised that 70% of people infected with Ebola have died, too. In Africa, there are not many hospital facilities and that place is entirely unsanitary, so African people cannot deal with this disease. People all around the world should help them. I also wish that there will be not the dead of Ebola as soon as possible."
NBE03860,"I agree with your opinion. Japanese people tend to think the epidemic of Ebola as someone else's problem. Japan and West Africa is too far to imagine their lives. However, in fact, the influence of Ebola has already appeared. we have to think victims of Ebola more seriously."
NBE03931,"When I finished reading the article, I strongly sympathized with Aoki. I cannot stand to see gruesome depictions even in the fiction movies or dramas, so I was sure that I also might get big damage if I had been in her situation. I think people in the court should have consider psychological burdens as very sensitive and important matters, and understand deeply that their casual action would change other's life to bad one unexpectedly."
NBE03912,"I am surprised as reading this story. Especially, Aoki Hifumi suffered from insomnia. I think a lay judge is to serious to perform for general people. No matter how trying the circumstance, she couldn't say that . She felt responsible for the job, so she endured that. I sympathize with her at the point. I think such a environment is problem. The Japanese are widely considered to have responsibility for jobs, and not to be able to say ""No""or""I can't"". It is important that we must reconsider this system including mental treatment. In Japan, the system is just started, so we investigate other country that introduced in similar system of Japan. And If similar incident of mental damage like this article in other country, we should learn how they deal with that. This system has a big influence on life, so It is necessary for people to understand about this system. And professional judges need to work slowly and carefully with citizen judges."
NBE03870,"I think that the lay judge system should be abolished. According to the Japanese Court, the purpose of the lay judge is to realize a society where people can have easy access to judicial services. But, there is no need to have easy access to judiciary. The lay judge is attack on the independence of the judiciary. Court decision is not making by consensus but by laws."
NBE03918,"I support the judgment ruled by The Fukushima District Court. There are two reasons. First, I think there is nothing wrong with the hiring method of the lay judge system. As the article said, citizens can decline to be on juries. In short, lay judges involve the responsibility to fulfill their work. So even if you suffer from disorder as a result of serving on a jury, the lay judge system isn't to blame. Second, I also think serving on a jury doesn't constitute involuntary servitude. In regards to this, Hifumi Aoki think it is duty for citizens to serve on juries, but I think it is duty and right. And it made the judiciary be close not only to expert but to citizens. So I entirely think the lay judge system is constitutional. Due to the above reasons, I support the judgment."
NBE03937,"I think the judgment is right. But, Fukushima district court had to announce strongly the possibility to see and hear gruesome evidence to citizen judges. It is right that Ms Aoki had right to refuse a demand to become a citizen judge and to participate gruesome murder trial. before the court , if she heard that the citizen judges have to watch terrible photos, she had not be elected as a citizen judge. Also, she did not agonize the ASD. I cannot think only Ms Aoki has to take the responsibility for her ASD. I think also Fukushima district court which did not announce important thing is responsible for her ASD."
NBE03948,"I disagree with lay judge system. That is certain there are various advantage s, for example, people can have interest for social problem, judgment is made by not only a judge but also ordinary citizen, and a term of trial can be shortened. But this article show us that working as a judge is harder than image. Anyone don't want to see grisly crime scene photos. Like Hifumi Aoki there are people who have mentally shock. Damages by trial are too much. It is bad a trial torture ordinary citizen. Therefore I oppose the system."
NBE03926,"I support the lay judge system. It is because the system has good influence on our lives. It is possible for us to feel that judicial and social problem are more familiar. However, if we don't try to understand the system, problems such as this occur. Therefore, judges need to support citizens involved the trial carefully. If they can do it, the system will give a better effect on our lives. I think that ambiguous understanding of the lay judge system begets this problem. There are many things that must be improved about the system from now."
NBE03922,"When I read this article, I surprised very much. I feel like understanding a feeling of Aoki. There is the person who cannot look at a horror film and the grotesque picture in one of the world. Even if it works to show such people a picture and a photograph by force, I think that there can be a serious thing. It may be difficult for the lay judge system to mind the psychology situation and the physical condition of such a citizen judge for the system that was still just introduced. We must think about a human being."
NBE03905,"I was very surprised at the news. I think it is a pity. It is true that refusing to be a lay judge is difficult. However, the system will not hold if you approve an exception. Now I am studying The Constitution. Interpretations of constitutions often cause problem. All people have human rights, but they can be limited in some cases. There is interest in each person. So politics is difficult. I think the result of the trial isn't wrong. I want to study politics more."
NBE03889,"When I read this article, I think her allegation is going too far. The judge system is need for judging fair by the view point of people and she couldn't assert the system is unconstitutionality easily. Also, it's incredible that she instituted a suit seeking redress. I think that she wouldn't understand the judge system properly and she is thoughtless. Certainly, the photo which used in the trial might be so grotesque and many people don't want to see. But since she was nominated for lay judge, she has a duty to be resolved see the various cruel materials and integrate the trial."
NBE03916,"I think that the court's judgment was a bit too paternalistic. Certainly it may be one of the jury's duties to see some grotesque photos, but in the first place, we often overlook the fact that we have difficulty in refusing to be lay judges even if we have some valid reasons. And how about ""informed-consent""? Reading the news, we can find it doubtful that all juries are told enough beforehand that they may have to see something that may depress them. There is no denying that this two government-compelling aspects led to Ms. Aoki's mental disorder (as the article said, its causality was proved medically). Nevertheless, the court ruled against her, as if to say that she neglected ""to function as a citizen"". I wonder if it is really right. This news shows us the underlying disadvantages that a jury system has. Some changes should be made for the jury system, particularly for the process of selecting lay judges."
NBE03871,"When I read this, I think what comes around goes around. Lay judge system was introduced to dissipate the dissociation of citizen and judiciary. I think this institution is functioning effectively. However it is sure that a new system created while at the same time new problem arise. The conflict with human being can't be helped. But judiciary does not make a judgment about this but should get something done."
NBE03885,"I do not think it is right of the woman to start a lawsuit. Once we are chosen as a lay judge, we should prepare for something grisly because it is simply obvious that a criminal case has gruesome pictures or videos. Everyone in Japan know a lay judge system is carried out, so we have to prepare oneself mentally for a trial. Also, the side of a court should pay close attention to feelings of lay judges because they are not related to a criminal case in normal life. Japan needs to examine what the appropriate a lay judge system should be in the future."
NBE03908,"When I read this article, I think that the Fukushima district court's refusal was right. Certainly I sympathize with Aoki, but we have the right that we can refuse serving as a lay judge. Serving as a lay judge means accepting seeing and hearing horrifying scenes. We should think this problem seriously. We must not forget that it involves a lot of risk and responsibility that you judge a person."
NBE03932,"I thought lay judge system is good idea because they can consider with ordinary persons opinion in the court. But, after read this article I think it is not always so. Almost all people who chosen for lay judge system are novices in trial. So, I think it is important that they have been considered about both psychological and spiritual damage as very sensitive matters."
NBE03898,"I had not known this news, so I was surprised that the event a lay judge had brought suit happened in Japan. This problems is so difficult. I don't know which is correct and which is incorrect. I can understand Aoki's opinion well. I'm pretty sure it is fact that psychological burden on lay judges is heavy. Maybe, It is a big pain beyond my guess. However there is system of declining to be juries. Besides, I don't think lay judge system is fault and I think it is Indispensable in judiciary in Japan. Therefore, I think the court should keep trying to diminish burden on lay judges."
NBE03914,"Indeed lay judge system is instructive for ordinary people, in other words beginners of law. Because it reflects the will of people in judgements. But I think the people not all but who want to participate in trials should take part in them. It's not good what leave scars on people's mind."
NBE03877,"I think that we should have informed her of whether she will have to see grisly photos. However, it is important for lay judges to see photos in order to judge the case. If photos are not used, lay judges may misunderstand the importance of the case. Therefore, I think that we need to use grisly photos. However, the court should choose people as lay judges who are tolerant of grotesque photos. The government cannot impose hard work on us though we are not criminals. The constitution says that. She should have chosen as a lay judge."
NBE03896,"I was surprised at the news because i haven't known the news before. I think that lay judge system should complete arrangement in order not to cause the happening. After choosing the lay judge person, we must first ascertain the wishes of the person concerned whether they can bear the grotesque things."
NBE03879,"I think this problem isn't quite irrelevant to us because all of us may be designated to be a jury. Besides this, since I major in law, this news is very interesting for me. The court declined the application of the violation of Article 18 of the Constitution and concluded that to be a jury doesn't deserve a toil. I think this decision is not right and it is improper for us to see cruel pictures against our wills."
NBE03945,"I thought lay judge system had an important role in a whole court system. However , after reading this story , I learned that it is not always true. I am examining lay judge system in another English class and I think that lay judge members had burden not only physically but also mentally because they can't read newspaper and watch TV and they can go nowhere during the court. I suppose not only Hifumi Aoki , many members are suffered from same reasons. That's why I think lay judge system should be changed for lay judge members and every citizens and the court."
NBE03920,"Reading this article, I can't help sympathizing Ms. Aoki. Of course, it is true that judgment is true in terms of constitutional view, but in my opinion, the government should do away with it. In the first place, this system was introduced to reflect the citizen's view. But, in the wake of it, many people are interfered with their daily routine. In addition to that fact, there are a lot of concerns which says 'It is no use introducing citizen as a judge, cause they are amateur of law. ' I myself agree to this notion. So, I presume this system should be abolished."
NBE03942,I think lay judge system should be abolished. It is difficult for those who are selected to reject it. It give them burden. This case is article's case. So lay judge system should be abolished.
NBE03940,i was surprised with this news. she was very very shocked.
NBE03911,"When I read this news, I thought how difficult lay judge system is. Japan adopted lay judge system after USA and UK. At first, It seemed good system. The reason is the system made people who are not judges participate in the discussions about crime. However, in these days there are some problems like this article. Lay judges can be affected by physical and mental problems. Even if people who was chosen as lay judges can decline the role, no one can expect that mental and physical problem would cause the people by the trial. Thus lay judge system should be discussed more and more."
NBE03884,"When I read this article, I was very surprised with what Mrs. Aoki. It is because what she said means that she deny the system of today's court. Although the stress which the material of the accident effects is not so little, I don't think she is in the right. Government allow people to deny attending court. So I think her logic will be recognized."
NBE03872,"I think we should reform the system of lay judges, but should not abolish it. When we discuss this kind of matter, we should agree checking trials is our rights, but not duty. This notion is first imported from Europe when the Constitution of the Empire of Japan. According to the Article 59 ""Trials and judgments of a Court shall be conducted publicly. "" We have the similar Article today in the Constitution of Japan. So it is the right. I think people can decide whether join trials or not. So if people who cannot bear pressures and cruelties can refuse to serve. By changing the system as the above, a lot of people would refuse to serve lay judges. But it is okay. people who are familiar with law but not lawyer would be the majority. They know what is going on a trial and check it. Also a lot of them have legal minds. they are important when criminal trials. it is desirable that only citizens who can take part of trials and judges will sustain lay judges."
NBE03882,"When I read this article, I think this kind of problems are very severe ones. This is because such problem is very related with emotional feelings and that depends on person to person, so I think it's very difficult to make rules toward this problem easily. Anyway, I believe that what is the most important thing is that all of us understand the bad situation and remind that we should try making efforts to solve this problem. We all could be the person like Hifumi Aoki and we are really related this problem."
NBE03927,"When I read this article, I feel Aoki is poor. It's necessary to see an evidence in the court. This is because if they don't provide a true evidence, they won't judge a suspect. However it's also important to protect human rights of someone serving as a lay judge. So I suggest that a court should get a permission to see grisly photos from a person served as a lay judge and compensate them for the emotional burden."
NBE03941,"When I read this article, I was very surprised and sympathized Aoki. The citizen judges will be chosen randomly from among qualified voters. She is the one, too. The qualified voter cannot decline a citizen judge without a special reason. According to this article, Aoki got sick because of the evidence photograph. Lay judge system is not surely bad. However, I think that the court should provide enough cares for her. I hope that a person like her does not appear again."
NBE03909,It is difficult to avoid viewing grisly crime scene photos for lay judges to make a judgment. However courts should do something for them. Her lawyer said Aoki was not mentally prepared to see grisly photos. Therefore it is a big progress that lay judges will be informed ahead of the trial if grisly photos are to be introduced as evidence to the court.
NBE03951,"Reading this article aroused mixed feeling in me. I think Aoki has responsibility and a duty to see and hear evidence and has to face the crime which she committed. So, I was not able to sympathize with her at first. However, I think that human rights of any people should be protected. Although Aoki committed the murder, it is wrong that her human right should be infringed obstinately. I don't know her circumstances, so I can't sympathize with her, but I think that her insistence should be acknowledged more."
NBE03938,"I support lay judge system. Because, it can live man-like to participate in politics. But, there are many problem, it likes this article. Some people feel burden this system. So I propose Installation of a mental supporters for them. It can reduce their mental burden, I think."
NBE03934,"I sympathize with the woman. If I had to see the photos which display grisly scenes, I would feel sick. I heard that my friend's sister, who studies law at college, also have seen such photos in the criminal law's class. Although she had heard that photos of grisly scenes will be projected from the teacher in advance, in that class, she got dizzy and could not take the class till last. The woman in this case did not know that the photos were projected so the shock she got would be immeasurable."
NBE03876,"I support lay judge system from the viewpoint of citizen can participate in the judicature, but it damage lay judge for example when they are shown grisly evidence in murder trials. I think Ms. Aoki was very shocked when she saw grisly photos, and if I were her, also I were shocked at them and suffered from insomnia. It is important for trials to check evidence, but a court should inform ahead of the trial if grisly photos are to be introduced as evidence and give alternatives that lay judge can refuse such grisly evidence."
NBE03950,"I approve of the result of this trial. And an improvement of a juror system is expected. First, since a jury system is a national duty, it is not a slavish restraint. Next, even if it expects seeing a grotesque picture of evidence, the person himself/herself can not know whether they are contents which he/she can bear. It is clear that the explanation on the administration-of-justice side until now was insufficient. That is, although judgment of a trial is right, there is room to improve a juror system."
NBE03900,"I think lay judge system has a lot of problems. In such this case, the system had no consideration for lay judge. Even if the gruesome photos, movies and voices are very important evidence, the lay judge does not want to see them so it need not to see because it will be possible to bear the emotional burden. In other case, if you are selected for lay judge, you cannot refuse, so it will get behind in your life. Lay judge system was introduced because it would raise citizens' concern about the judiciary. Certainly, since then, I had never had concern about it, however, I have been interested in it now. I think lay judge system leaves much room for improvement."
NBE03946,"I was surprised at this news for inconsiderable of the court to general people. Though the court needs gruesome clues, they must care the general people who served as a lay judge."
NBE03881,"It is very difficult to answer this problem. It is sure that the lay judge system contains gruesome evidences, for example we might have to see some things we don't expect. However, I think the lay judge system is necessary for us, because it can see things objectively. So, I think the lay judge system should improve."
NBE03907,"I disagree with lay judge system. Indeed there are a lot of advantages of this system, for example, people who aren't familiar with law or criminal can take part in trials. This experience would give them interests for the judicial world. However, there are a lot of disadvantages. I think this article shows this negative phase vividly. Mr. Aoki didn't want to watch such grotesque photos. But he had to watch them against his will because he was a lay judge. I wonder this coercive participation deny his fundamental right. Just because it is the citizen's duty to take part in trials as a lay judge, it doesn't follow that the government can force us to watch all evidences. I'm for the Fukushima District Court judge, but I think the lay judge system should be abolished."
NBE03933,I agree with you. I think lay judge system should not be introduced in forced way. It is true that there are many positive points so I don't think it to be abolished but people who don't want to be lay judge should quit of that.
NBE03888,"I agree with your opinion. Though the lay judge system is very important for our society, the system might have a serious burden for people. So the government need to do such exam when they were elected as lay judge. Also people had better make up their mind to deal with such grotesque materials."
NBE03947,"I agree with you. Judging with gruesome clues is hard work, so they should be considered. This system has room for further improvement."
NBE03915,"I in part agree with you. We know that the jury system is necessary in today's society in a way, yet there are much more problems than we imagine. This case is just one of them. Though I do not say that the system has to be abolished, I think all Japanese should think over the pros and cons about it."
NBE03935,"I disagree with lay judge system. It is difficult for those who are selected to reject it. I think lay judge system should not be introduced in forced way. We know that the jury system is very necessary nowadays, but there are a lot of problems. This case is just small piece of them. However I don't think that the system has to be abolished, I wish all Japanese should think about it."
NBE03929,"When I heard this news, I worried about her immediately. In the first place, I am against this system. The accident may burden like woman and it does not think that it is possible in the fair judges because they do not know the law. However, I think that the country should support the maximum since there is such a system. I think the support for her is not enough. About this system, I think that it is necessary to reconsider it more so that such a person never appears."
NBE03923,"I agree with the lay judge system. Because, the system is going well. This kind of case could be expected! It is not appropriate to criticize emotionally when some problems happen. Of course, the court is responsible for this accident. The lay judge is a great system but we must manage carefully."
NBE03875,"I agree with your opinion. I also think the lay judge system has good influence on our participation in the judicature, but judges have to support citizens in the trial carefully."
NBE03928,"I agree with your opinion. It is hard for me to watch a fiction movie and a drama. Therefore I can understand what you are saying and the burden on her. Thus, I hate this role. So the government understands the pains of people whom the life may turn into and I think that it is necessary to take measures."
NBE03910,I agree with you. I think the lay judge system has good influence on our lives. Because social problems are more familiar to us. But serious problems like this would occur if citizens don't have enough understanding about lay judge system.
NBE03869,"I agree with you. Having interest for social problem doesn't serve as a justification for getting a shock. And, I think people don't need to entertain an interest in judicial services. We should leave it up to professional's judgment. It is necessary to preserve independence of the judiciary."
NBE03874,"This judicial issue is very difficult to solve, because hie judicial system is purposed on justice for people, Furthermore, trial is needed fairness and accuracy. If people who judge a defendant cannot have overview of incidents, this system won't work properly. However, for lay judges, They are not accustomed to face sever decision and situation, but one citizen, So, I think it is important for government to improve this system which people do not have heavy burden at the court as possible. Although i the trial accuser's claim in not accepted, government in Japan will need to make some efforts about judicial reform."
NBE03924,"I agree with your opinion. I also think that the lay judge system should be discussed more and more. However, The lay judge system has good influence on our lives. Thanks to the lay judge system, we can act with a reason and a order."
NBE03925,"I agree with your opinion. I also think there are many problems in the lay judge system. If participants bear the emotional burden, they will get behind in their livings. However, it is certain that the lay judge system has good influence on our lives."
NBE03873,"I partly agree with you. Surely, In the court, when people judge a person, law expert may be much more better. But in Japan, people do not want to be interested in a court so much. In that point, lay judge system will be expected."
NBE03936,"I approve your opinion. civil judge system has large influence on civil judge's life after the trial. Japan should learn from other countries to manage civil judge system better. In this case, the judge system caused her heavy mental stress. However, if the judge system administer better, more and more civilian have interested in laws and judges."
NBE03897,"I agree with your opinion. I think lay judge system is not fault and it is Indispensable in judiciary in Japan. As you say, in order not to cause the happening, lay judge system should be under review."
NBE03949,"I also approve of your opinion. It is not perfect although a jury system is a good idea. Those who participate in a jury system are beginners. There are few people who have got used to a cruel photograph and incident. This incident became an opportunity to consider the necessity for the care of the heart to a lay judge. It needs to be tried hard for reducing mental damage. Probably, I get interested in this incident from now on also."
NBE03919,"I strongly agree with your opinion, I too became disillusioned with the Japanese law system. Japanese citizen judge system should be optional. Those who dislikes blood , gruesome scene should be removed from that system. It isn't too much to say that this is a little bit infringement of personal human right."
NBE03930,"I agree with your opinion. I also think our rights is protected by the laws such as the Constitution, and the case is a violation of them. It is very serious problem."
NBE03939,"I think so too. People who chosen for lay judge system may experience psychological suffering. In my opinion, they need to install mental supporters who can reduce their mental burden."
NBE03883,"When I read your comment, I really agree with you and I also feel sorry for Aoki Hifumi. I also think most Japanese are not good ay saying ""No"" or ""I can't"". Such character is naturally Japanese good point, but at the same time, it is sometimes bad point. Therefore, I think your idea that we can learn another countries where there are similar problems about this. We have just started such system so I think it's very important to consider how other countries' situations are. Anyway, I also think this kind of matter will have great influence on our lives so we all have to consider this problem."
NBE03894,I also think most Japanese are not good ay saying 'No' or 'I cannot'.
NBE03893,"Reading this article, I sympathized Aoki. It is very difficult to refuse being lay judgment. But I think the system, that ray judgements would be informed if grisly photos are to be introduced as evidence and they could refuse participating in trial, is needed. To continue lay judge system, burden of lay judgment should be decreased."
NBE03892,I agree with your opinion. It is very important to improve the treatment of lay judges and the change you mention is great progress.
NBE03902,"I think this is a difficult problem. Actually, it is important to listen opinions of ordinary person by using a lay judge system. However, we must think about feelings of lay judge. If I am chosen as a lay judge, I will be anxious. Furthermore, If I am shown grisly photos, I will feel a strong stress like Aoki. So, the Japanease Goverment must consider a counter plan for this problem."
NBE03901,"I think so too. This problem is not easy to solve. Actually, lay judge system is good idea. However, this system lacks consideration for lay judges' mental damage. So, I want the Japanese government to take measures for this problem as soon as possible."
NBE03891,"Lay judge system is an important part of the democracy, because citizens are able to participate in the administration of justice, however, they sometimes suffer from the stuff that they see in the process of trial such as cruel photos. I personally think they should abide that because they should know that they possibly see such kind of things before the trials begin."
NBE03895,I agree with your opinion. I think that lay judge system has good influence. This is because it thinks that we came to be interested in a judge. But we can make rules about care of participation of the lay judge
NBE03921,"I think that now the jury system is the duty of the Japanese people. In trial, juries which consist of citizen carry out great tasks for fair judge and are indispensable to democracy. So juries must endure some mental anguish. But judges also must consider the mental anguish of juries."
NBE03917,"I agree to your opinion. I also think lay judge system has good influence on our lives. Naturally enough, the purpose of judicial judge is to protect citizens against inequality, so I think it is necessary for citizens to involve in it."
NBE03944,"I think so, too. We have to change the lay judge system not to hurt the members of lay judge physically and mentally."
NBE03906,"I agree with your opinion. It is hard for me to watch such a terrible pictures. Therefore I can understand why he suffered. So, I hate this role. The government understands the pains and I think that it is necessary to take measures."
NBE03880,"I completely agree with you. I think lay judge system is necessary, because it can examine objectively. However it make people who participate in lay judge shocked because of see gruesome evidence. So government should improve this system."
NBE03890,I totally agree with your idea. I also think that juries should endure some mental anguish.
NBE03943,"I think so, too. Judges should support jury and citizen judge."
NBE03878,I agree with you. I think the lay judge system is pretty good but lay judges shouldn't be given mental shock through the trial because they join the trial without their will.
NBE03904,I think this problem could have been solved before this happens when I read this article. That is because the problem like this could have been expected. And I totally agree with its measure. But there will be people who are not able to see such grotesque foots and so on. We have to rethink new idea as to serving as a lay judge.
NBE03903,I agree with your opinion. I think lay judge system leaves much room for improvement too. We have to continue to rethink new idea.
NBE03913,"Including this problem, court system in Japan has a lot of problem which could have been solved long time ago. However, before this case happening, we have not express this kind of problem and are not interested in it. What Japanese government has to do is start to solve these problems. Otherwise, there will be more victims like her."
NBE03886,"I believe this problem should not happen. However, I believe this lay judge system is good."
NBE03887,I support the lay judge system too and I think the lay judge system will good influence.
NBE03899,"I think the lay judge system is good thing. It is because listening nation's opinion is good way to judge. But if I was chosen for lay judge member, I will become so nervous and be irresolute because I am afraid of seeing pictures of victims and the scene of the accident. So, I think that after care for the members is very important to defend there heart from depression."
NBE03952,"I'm surprised that the Fukushima District Court has turned down a suit by the woman, Hifumi Aoki, who was claiming damages for stress of trial. I think government should guarantee that the person who agree to trial job is healthy."
NBE06632,"When I finished reading the topic, I deeply sympathized with her. I cannot stand to see grisly depictions even in the fiction or dramas, so I was sure that I also might get big damage if I had been put in her situation. I think people in the court should have consider psychological burdens as very sensitive and important matters, and understand deeply that their casual action would change other's life to worth one than expected."
NBE06631,I agree with your opinion. Law expert's voice is absolutely correct. Public's opinion may be made by emotion not logic.
NBE05999,"I can't agree with your opinion. Because there is low that protects people who relate lay judge system. She I feel very sorry her thing. But we have to recognize about other incident. There are a lot of incident in the world and same in Japan. That incident includes relating big power. For example, there is nation back a incident. And there is a lot of values in Japan. In order to incorporate the diverse values lay judge system is introduced. And lay judge system is including role to monitor the judiciary. So I think this system have to be. She possible to decline. This system flexible about declining from it. But she decided allowing offer. It is clear that she know she has to saw some grisly crime scene photos and it interferes with her work. So human rights is saving from them and that is not violation of the Constitution. But I think nation have to be open more information to public about lay judge system. Sense there are some possibilities that we are choose lay judge. But we don't know detail about it. It cause like this. I think that, so I against your opinion but your opinion is great and right."
NBE06000,"When I read this article, I was very shocked at slave labor being used in the sever condition. Although I know there are discrimination in the world, I didn't think such a terrible situation. It will be difficult Japan stop importing shrimp from their countrys, so the government should make regulations which protect human rights and control the company strictly. I can't agree with your opinion. Because there is low that protects people who relate lay judge system. She I feel very sorry her thing. But we have to recognize about other incident. There are a lot of incident in the world and same in Japan. That incident includes relating big power. For example, there is nation back a incident. And there is a lot of values in Japan. In order to incorporate the diverse values lay judge system is introduced. And lay judge system is including role to monitor the judiciary. So I think this system have to be. She possible to decline. This system flexible about declining from it. But she decided allowing offer. It is clear that she know she has to saw some grisly crime scene photos and it interferes with her work. So human rights is saving from them and that is not violation of the Constitution. But I think nation have to be open more information to public about lay judge system. Sense there are some possibilities that we are choose lay judge. But we don't know detail about it. It cause like this. I think that, so I against your opinion but your opinion is great and right."
NBE03992,"I always hear this news recently. I respect these people and I am proud of them as a Japanese. I often use blue LED light at my house. If there is not this light, our life will become very inconvenient. Nakamura gets only a settlement of 84, 400 million yen though he did so splendid invention. The settlement is too small. Because Nichia Corp gained more money by his invention, I think that the company should pay the settlement that is suitable for Nakamura. Anyway, I hope that an inventor such as Nakamura appears again."
NBE03972,"I didn't know the patent trial. However, I have heard that the conditions of research in Japan is not good. So I was not very surprised at the news. We are proud of them. But we should not be just glad. To keep up with other countries, we must change the current environment."
NBE03963,His invention is really splendid. I wonder why it took time so far until invention of LED was awarded as the Nobel Prize. We can decrease the number of times of replacing an electric bulb and it becomes much brighter than conventional bulb by using LED. I think that the invention is also very ecological. I hope that many people use LED all over the world and their lives become more comfortable. Mr. Nakamura should be acclaimed more.
NBE03977,"It is quite natural that he should complaint of his reward. I think he is cool, and hope his desire will come true."
NBE03979,"He seems a bit too extreme. He acts as if he made success on his own and the Nichia Corp is completely malicious. But I wonder if it is really true. There is the fact that the company's risky funding drove him (and his co-worker and subordinates) into the invention of the blue LED. Although his initial bonus from the company is very low and his resentment was surely natural, I felt it is not reasonable that he alone get paid as much as 844 million yen."
NBE03996,"I didn't know the cruel treatment for investors in Japan. I don't understand Nichia Corp employ him under cruel condition in spite of the great invention, the blue LED. I was amazed he worked hard in such treatment. His pride would be hurt. Though now he is American, Japan should treat engineer well in own country because they are promising persons in the future."
NBE03993,"I have already heard that the conditions of research in Japan is not good, too. I think that there is too little remuneration to Nakamura even if Japan is such situation. It was related, too, and Nakamura has gone to the foreign country. The development of the technology is indispensable for development of Japan. So, to leave a scientist in Japan, I also think Japan should change the current environment for scientist."
NBE03962,"We think using LED is normal, but it is fortunate thing. Many scientists overcame difficulties and put forth unrelenting effort, so various technology have advanced and we live comfortably. We should express our thanks to any scientists."
NBE03953,"Japanese government should take this opportunity for some reflection. Japanese government must prevent the outflow of technological to other countries. I think the protection of engineers is the issue of the future of Japan. It is necessary thing for maintain global competitiveness. We should guard the interests of the developer through patents. To the end, engineers need to receive reasonable compensation. Aggressive behavior in a Japanese company should not be overlooked. This bonus is too cheap. Mr Nakamura may well get angry."
NBE03984,"At first I was glad to hear that a Japanese won the Nobel Prize. However, I read this article, and some opinions changed. Nakamura must have fought against a company to protect the thing which I invented. Japan should take right measures to protect an inventor like Nakamura."
NBE03985,"I heard this news before. Needless to say, I think that it should be praised what he won the Nobel Prize. However, I think that you should attract attention about the hard distance that he walked so far. I think that the Japan support for the engineer is lighter than other developed countries. When it may look like it, they want to study it in other countries. It is obvious that this may lead to the outflow of the Japanese engineer. This news is happy, but I think that it is the news that can attract attention for the problem of Japan."
NBE03988,"Though there are many great scientist in Japan, the condition of research is not good in Japan. In Japan, there are many scientists who want to conduct big research but they don't have enough money for that. I think if Japanese science research condition is improved and paid more subsidy for scientists, they can conduct big research in Japan and more nobel prize winner may appear from Japan!"
NBE03956,"After I read this news, I thought how nice this plan is! Although quickly practicing may cause many trouble, but this plan will give us a big dream. If it is achieved soon, we can live in SF world. It will become more fun. For human, Flying in the sky freely is a kind of dream. Although now we can ride a plane, this car can make a big dream come true."
NBE03957,"When I read this article, I thought scientists in Japan should receive a high salary if they accomplish greatly in their research. Japan has been said for a long time the scientific and technological powerhouse. If we have the vast research results of scientists, this country won't be developed. In spite of Mr. Nakamura played a great achievement , Japanese company did not pay enough salary. Although it is solved in the court, he left Japan by changing the nationality. If this situation continues, international competitiveness in science and technology of Japan will increasingly be reduced. I think it is important to evaluate scientists who has achieved excellent results correctly."
NBE03969,"When Mr. Nakamura invented the blue LED, I was surprised that he received only 20000 yen. I can imagine how he felt about it. This shows that how little Japan government and companies support for scientists or engineers. He sued for the firm, after all, he received 844 million yen, however, he contributed it to other group of scientists. If he did not sue the scientists and engineers would have been ignored. I think his action was worthy of praise. After this chance I hope many Japanese scientists try to widen their sphere of activity."
NBE03995,I think this news suggest that the environment for people doing research of Japan is bad. THus I think the government should give money for research not to company but individual.
NBE03961,I think so too. Japanese government should support scientist.
NBE03973,"I think so too. However, when I heard recent news, I changed my opinion. It is true that Japan has to cherish scientists , investors and researchers. But each environment of Japan and America has good points and bad points. So this is a difficult problem."
NBE03964,"What Nakamura did for gain more bonus was meaningful. Knowing they will acquire more money whey they achieve something, they would work hard to invent so research. Motivation is extremely important in inventing new things. It seems to me that Japanese mass media tend to emphasize it too much when ""Japanese"" people won something or achieved something great. The reason for this is not very clear, but it might be because Japanese are very proud of their own nation."
NBE03994,"Recently, I often heard this news. I suppose many Japanese are interested in Nobel Prize and they feel happy when achievement of Japanese is selected as Nobel Prize. However, I think we have to remember many Japanese scientists expect for Nobel winners are doing every research ."
NBE03981,"Now his nationality is not Japanese. As the proverb says ""It is no use crying over spilt milk. "" It is true that, his invention is so magnificent . The crux of this story is not that he won the Nobel Prize but which nationality he belongs to."
NBE03986,"I was very impressed when I read the article, because I felt Mr Nakamura's passion directly. And I thought such a person would influence and change our society. There are many people who have complains to our society, but almost all of them would keep it only in their mind. This doesn't change any situation, so we should move as him actively. When many people move like him, the society must become better."
NBE03955,"I agree with you. Japan's economy is based on engineers. Because our car industry and electronics are powerful. So they should be more respected in the system. More rewarded, more social status."
NBE03954,"I agree with you. Japan's economy is based on engineers. Because our car industry and electronics are powerful. So they should be more respected in the system. More rewarded, more social status."
NBE03976,Good idea! The government should give money for individual scientists!
NBE03989,"I realized that Japanese researchers are more badly treated than foreign researchers. So, I think corporation should endeavor to assure proper treatment of researchers."
NBE03997,"I agree with you. Their study cost enormous expenses and their valuable time. The company and the government should pay the settlement that is suitable for people doing research to bring up them. A certain investment is necessary so that big dreams come true. I hope that an inventor such as Nakamura appears again, too."
NBE03965,"It is widely known that Japanese science and technology level is high. But I often hear that treatments of scientist is worse in Japan than in other developed country. To develop Japanese science and technology, it is needed to improve treatment of scientists."
NBE03987,"I think so too. All over the world, there are many things that perform with blue LED. We use such a technology as common thing. But, Not only Nichia corporation but also we have to feel thankful for inventors such as Nakamura."
NBE03971,"I agree with your opinion. I think there are still some people who encounter unjust treatment like Nakamura. So, the Japanese Government must consider a counter plan for this problem."
NBE03983,"I really think three Japanese nobel winner is very awful! I respect them and they must be worthy of being honored by everyone. So, Japanese government and companies must strive for improving the environment of scientists. If they do so, the Japanese circles of science will more and more develop."
NBE03959,"I think that the company in Japan should think a great deal of investors. It is true that the most important thing for a company is to make as much money as possible. However, they had not made any money without investors. Furthermore, international companies give investors more money than companies in Japan do because it is ""global standards"". We have to introduce this theory."
NBE03958,"I disagree with you. The Nichia Corp should have treated him more considerately. The company could not have made a lot of money without him. It is true that the company supported him financially. However, money can not buy flashes of genius."
NBE03968,I agree with your opinion. There is not enough satisfied condition to research something for scientist in Japan. I wish the environment for research is improved in order to develop scientific technology in Japan.
NBE03960,"I feel I could understand the suffering of scientists a little by reading this article. Indeed, Nichia's treat to Mr. Nakamura was improper and couldn't be justified, but it's interesting for me that he could get a Nobel prize due to anger and effort occurred from that misfortune."
NBE03975,"I have heard this news before. I think that Japan's help for the scientists is bad. Scientists have developed Japan's science. We always need their effort and always thank them. But oppositely, an engineer has been taken the attitude which doesn't pay off for the thanks. We should thank them more and help more."
NBE03966,"His invention is really splendid. I think that the company in Japan should think a great deal of investors. Though companies should make money as much as possible, they should make an investment in scientists."
NBE03967,I agree with you. The engineer deserves the credit for all the past development of Japan. So the government and the companies help them and should invest future engineers.
NBE03974,"I completely agree with you. Japanese inventor should be given more money. Our life was supported by science technology, so inventor's contribution is bigger than we think."
NBE03991,"I approve your opinion, too. I'm happy that Japanese wisdom is admitted by the world. Japanese rise of the scientific level would bring benefit to Japan."
NBE03982,I agree with you. Japanese government and company is not good. They must take measures to meet a situation of Japanese scientist.
NBE03978,"I was very happy to hear this news and respect them. However I complain about the environment surrounding them. In Japan, environment surrounding them is not as good as in other countries. If this situation continues, there will be no Japanese noel winner. For scientists and Japanese development, we should improve this situation."
NBE03990,"I think his opinion passes thorough argument. Certainly, they are amateur of law. But, it's possible to cover it with making education of a law. Not that this system is bad, but the case that the people have no legal literacies is a problem."
NBE03980,"Although his opinion have a point, I still think that he think too much of ""a genus"". It may be true that money cannot buy flashes of genius, it can actually ""invest"" money and other workers in their ability. And it is ""the investment"" that enable Mr. Nakamura to invent the LED. His invention was accomplished not by his own, but by the company as a whole. It's a natural thing to gain profit from the investment. The Nichia Corp won the bet, after all."
NBE03998,"If researchers weren't evaluated, they wouldn't motivate to invent new things. In Japan there are a lot of major industrial electronics manufacturers, Sony, NEC, Panasonic, and so on. On the other hand, Korean corporation, SAM SUNG, developed rapidly, because they hired away Japanese superior researchers from Japanese major industrial electronics manufacturers. So I think it important that companies treat researchers considerately."
NBE03970,"This comment make me assent. Therefore her opinion about this problem has consistency, so for readers , it is easy to understand. I think most Japanese are not good at saying ""No"" or ""I can't"", too. This is a bad point. I also think we should learn other country's system."
NBE04001,"I think there are two reasons why Chinese state-run paper blame US. First reason is the consideration of Chinese domestic governance. Second reason is the consideration of viewpoint from Taiwan. I have taken Chinese politic classes, and one of these classes also took up this problem. Among Chinese politic researcher, the Chinese Communist Party is seemed to try merging Taiwan. Taiwan has mainly governed by the Chinese National Party, so Taiwan is a democratic state. Chinese government wants to confine the Hong Kong democracy protest. However, if using Chinese military power to restrain the democracy movement, Taiwan people and government have more distrust of China. Therefore, broadcasting as US leading the Hong Kong democracy, Chinese government show the inappropriateness of the democracy protests."
NBE03999,I think Chinese Communist party cannot take control of Hong Kong. Because Hong Kong has different government from Chinese dictatorship. So people in Hong Kong seek freedom. China is 4th largest country in the world. And the population is more than a billion. There are also different kinds of peoples. Their ways of thinking are different from each other. So the Communist party cannot admit freedom of every people in order to sustain the order and system of government. But why not separate their country to some countries. They do not have to be one. Their way of sustaining is just oppression of human fundamental rights.
NBE04000,I cannot accept this issue because the Communist China is now stressing democracy. I think China should commit the freedom of the speech or let Hong Kong be an independent country. However Hong Kong is a core area of Chinese economic. Beijing Government will not release them for a while. I am really regrettable about that. The international world must criticize the Communist China and support Hong Kong demonstration.
NBE04106,"It is more trouble to many people than it is worth that songs are automatically downloaded even if they are free. I think that iTunes users gripe is quite natural because the record took up valuable iPhone storage space of them. I am troubled about that I don't have enough iPhone and PC storage space now, so if same thing happen to me, I won't feel good."
NBE04026,"The incident is very impressive for me. When the U2's album was released for free on the internet , I was signed in iTunes. So the album was downloaded arbitrarily in my music application. As I didn't know that U2's album, I was very surprised the downloading and scared. I thought my account was taken over and some is impersonating my account user. My family became very anxious and searched how change the password of my account. Then we understood the downloading was done by Apple, so we felt relieved and got angry the download. I think it's good that U2 released the album for free, but I don't want to be downloaded arbitrarily even if the commercial are done."
NBE04099,"When I heard this news, I was very surprised. Because I had signed in iTunes two days ago. I checked my iTunes at once and knew that U2's album hadn't been downloaded on my iTunes. If U2's album had been downloaded on my iTunes, I would have been anxious about a computer virus. And also I would have been unpleasant because my valuable shortage of iTunes could decrease by album which I am not interested in. I couldn't forgive Apple and U2 if this accident had been scheme in collaboration."
NBE04089,"I have already known that U2's latest album has sent to individual's iTunes. But I do not think this causes such a big problem in the world. In the way, I think apple should take responsibility for this problem. Because If apple had already make choices weather iTunes customer get U2's album for free or not, many iTunes customers have not been complained. In fact, U2 is the known and popular rock band. Nonetheless, there are many people who have not been interested in U2. For me, I had not known U2 until I read this article. Therefore, apple had to consider various people's needs."
NBE04083,"I did not know this news so when I read this article, I was so surprised. I do not use iTunes because I don't have iPods nor iPhones. Thus I do not know the system of iTunes in detail, but I knew that, to add musics of iTunes to Podcasts, we must pay for them. However, in this case, the album was distributed for free. Moreover, there are people who were troubled by it. I think both the artist and Apple should take responsibility for them."
NBE04023,"I think automatic freebie is a good idea. Some people like U2's songs taking advantage of delivery. However, this system got a lot of criticism because their album took up valuable iPhone storage space. Some iTunes users certainly were irritated by this. The fact that Bono meant no harm is an important point. If Apple had not made such a system, U2 would not have lost their popularity. I believe it is wrong for only U2 to be criticized."
NBE04012,"When I read this article, to tell the truth, I couldn't understand what's happen. Now I think Bono gave away U2's latest album for free on iTunes account without malice, because he wanted iTunes users to listen their new songs, but users were sure to wonder why there was the album on their iTunes account although they didn't download it. Apple should have given users alternatives whether they downloaded the album or not."
NBE04094,"When I read this article, I thought that an act of Bono was good at the first. This is because we can obtain the latest album of the artist for free. However, I feel that this thought was wrong now. I usually use the android cellphone. So, because I do not use iTunes and structure of iTunes. In this case, U2's album took up valuable iPhone storage space. In the world, there are a lot of people who do not know U2. It is very annoying that the album of the artist which we are not interested in uses the storage space. I think that Apple and an artist should not cause such an event from now on."
NBE04002,"I think that U2 doesn't need to apologize. This method is a clear advertising strategy. I don't use the iTunes, so I don't know iTunes's system well enough. But, this case cause slight damage to iTunes user's maybe. If you dislike this music, you only have to delete from iTunes. Consequently, it may be said that U2 achieved a strategic victory. U2 made news with their performance, and then U2 is known by me."
NBE04053,"In my case, I don't know U2. So I think this is chance to know the group for free. But thinking from consumers who don't have a interest, it is worth grumbling. If they can choice whether doing download or not, they didn't claim. It is problem the album was download automatically. And people want to erase the album, they have to erase by themselves. Bono apologized to people, but they grumble about the automatically download system and the way of erase the songs. So I think to need to apologize is not so much Bono but Apple."
NBE04006,"I think this incident is not all that serious. As they hand out free samples on the street, giving out freebie songs deserve to go down. Recently, people only listen to the music which others are listening to, is famous and popular. In other words, they don't find new music on their own which they really approve. So, freebies of music give us the chances that we can encounter new songs. I think it is a breakthrough idea. But, what couldn't delete the songs was bad if person was not to his liking. After all an unsuitable sample is just like yesterday's garbage."
NBE04073,"U2's album downloaded automatically is good strategy for Apple to get to know more people about Apple. Therefore, I think it is not necessary for Apple to apologize. However, I was surprised at this incident when I knew it. I had misgivings about a risk of an outflow of personal information. Therefore, the true that U2's album took up valuable iPhone storage space worried me furthermore. I think it is important to provide an opportunity of the discussion between Apple and us. More detail explanation is necessary for us to understand it."
NBE04069,"I think that you must not have an influence on the domain of another person even if it is free. The world becomes convenient by the development of the information technology steadily, but there should be the line which we cannot exceed. It may be good for a method of the advertising, but must not force it on people. Say in Japanese; ARIGATAMEIWAKU. However, we take time to know the real intention of this event."
NBE04062,"I consider there is also a good side and bad side in U2 and Apple's action. First, I mention a good side of it. From the view point of U2's promotion, it can be said that they put over the beautiful idea very well. Because their latest album was given away on more than half billion iTunes accounts including mine. Probably lots of people who didn't known them listened to their songs. Next I mention a bad side of it. I think there were two problems in it. First problem is that their latest album was automatically downloaded. As a result of it, some iTunes users griped that the record took up valuable iPhone storage space. Second problem is that Apple made it impossible for people to remove the album from their iTunes accounts. Thereby, trifling complaints came into the open, I think. In this way, I consider there is also a good side and bad side in U2 and Apple's action."

Thereby, trifling complaints came into the open, I think. In this way, I consider there is also a good side and bad side in U2 and Apple's action."
NBE04014,"To give iPhone's users U2's album for free may makes them worry that they bought this album by mistake. To tell the truth, I experienced that. I am a iPhone's user. I did not think it was a problem. However, Apple should let them decide to get this album. The titles of music in your iPhone show your personality. Adding this album to your list without permission is too rude. I think Apple should take the blame for this untoward event."
NBE04061,"I consider there is also a good side and bad side in U2 and Apple's action. At first, I mention a good side of it. From the view point of U2's promotion, it can be said that they put over the beautiful idea very well.

Thereby, trifling complaints came into the open, I think. In this way, I consider there is also a good side and bad side in U2 and Apple's action."
NBE04036,"When I read this article, I remembered that U2's new album automatically had been downloaded onto my iTunes. It was not I read this until I knew the reason and the details. I can understand Bono's idea. He must have considered this idea as best means to everyone listen his songs freely. However, whether we will listen the song is depend on our right of choice. If we had could choose whether we download or not, everybody's grumbles wouldn't have spread."
NBE04078,"When I heard this news, I was very shocking. This is because I have not heard such this problem. If you admit such a thing only in a specific group, other groups hope the same thing and may cause confusion. In addition, they find the profit only for themselves and it is big failure to have brought big uneasiness to too people of the world. It will go without saying that an irreparable thing happens if not conscious of only this so that each people do not cause a problem in now when a network develops. I think that it is the serious news that people of the world realized it."
NBE04104,"Action of Bono is bad. There are two reasons . First, action of Bono is selfish . Everyone does not necessarily like this music. Actually, the criticism from many persons came. Second, it is impolite in other bands. Music is things to trade. Therefore, distributing for nothing is self-centered. In conclusion, a deed of Bono has an image of minus."
NBE04009,"When I read this news I was surprised. I often use iTunes, and I buy music. Music people like around the world different from not only country to county , but person to person. The sudden the automatic download of U2s may album upset people terribly except for U2's fans. After reading this article, a friend of mine also one of this confusion, she was very surprised at the emergence of the album, If I do so, I will get scary and may not have good feeling. About his affair, apple should not do so automatically, I think. Apple did something unnecessary. Although for U2, they think it is good chance to listen their music around the world, its reputations were not always good thing about this Apple's method. As a result, it may not be expected for them."
NBE04086,"When I read this article, I was very surprised because I didn't know this news. I didn't update my iPhone, so this album didn't downloaded to my iPhone automatically. But I think this idea is not so bad. it's because it charge no cost and we can listen to new album. Although it took up valuable iPhone storage space, but it is good to listen to a lot of people all over the world. I think If I am singer, I would do that maybe. but this is not good thing to iPhone users. Apple and Bono should apologized to users."
NBE04019,"Before I read this article, I didn't know the news about U2 album. Therefore, I really surprised to know that this kind of thing happened. At first, it seemed that iTunes users felt happy because they actually got the U2's latest album for free!! However, according to this article, many users would have trouble that their valuable iPhone storage was taken up. I don't use iTunes so I don't have enough knowledge about the usage exactly. However if I were in their place, I would be angry like them because such thing, that U2 album was downloaded automatically, was not following my own will. Considering what I wrote, the Bono's behavior was totally bad thing, but I think I can understand the feeling of artists and some burdens, such as pressure. Anyway, this kind of thing should not happen so we should try to make rules to escape such situation and not to permit this kind of actions."
NBE04049,"It's terrible. U2's members would be shocked very much. I'm sorry for him. However if I can download a song for free, I will be happy. It's difficult problem."
NBE04101,I think we can't blame the members of U2 for giving away U2's latest album for free on iTunes accounts. Because they did that in order to not only for themselves but also for the iTunes accounts. I think they should had given away their latest album for accounts who wanted to listen their songs.
NBE04076,"I understand the feelings Bono wanted a lot of people to hear his music, however, it's illegal to make iTunes accounts downloaded his music automatically. This is because we have human rights to listen to music we want to. But I think it's not bad to make his music free. Moreover I was surprised that he could make his music download our iTunes willfully. I felt scare as I don't know what I am going to be done online."
NBE04058,"This problem was caused by U2's thoughtless action. It may be a good attitude for its members to try to make their songs heard all over the world. However, they neglected to take iPhone users' privacy into consideration. They overlooked the fact that the Internet had become another reality, where personal spaces do exist and respected to some extent. For example, If the band were on streets or at some other public places in London as a promotion and distributed its new album to passengers as a freebie, they might not be angry so much and there might be no serious problem. But if it intruded on people's home at random and thrust the album to them, they would feel ""violated"" by the sudden visits and might complain about that. U2 just did the latter in the cyber world and at a much larger scale. So, in conclusion, privacy should be protected even in the Internet world."
NBE04048,"When I finished reading this article, I was surprised at this incident. I don't use iTunes, but if I used iTunes, I would be disgusted. I think that iTunes should take responsibility for this trouble rather than Bono. Because If iTunes's security had been stronger, this trouble would have happened."
NBE04044,"I was very surprised at this news. I don't angry with the action. However, some people whose devices' capacity of memory are low may complain. If the album had been automatically downloaded, users should have been able to remove it. Artists should be proud of their songs."
NBE04021,"I was very interested this article. At first , almost of us may feel sorry for U2. Many people could get the group's new album for free. Dud to it, their sales will decrease seemingly. However, we can see this problem from different point. Although their album was released free in iTunes, we can see some good point for U2 in this article. This is known globally due to the itself bigness and we can think it is good advertisement for U2. Their new album is known by many people and it will be good business."
NBE04095,"I am surprised that U2's new album is downloaded arbitrarily. I don't have iPod, iPhone and so on. So when I knew the news , I am surprised."
NBE04066,"This is the news of rock musicians who gave their latest album for free. In the wake of it, that incident arouse a some kind of problem. In short , suffice it to say that rock band group U2, especially Bono misunderstood what the consumers pleased with. Also It is true that a handful of i phone users might presume that 'What an elaborated and nice present this is!' . But other i phone users specially who are not interested in U2 must have thought it was infringement of their valuable asset, that is , limited capacity. Their merits are not incongruous with each other. May be Bono has chimera that their songs might please everybody. So, as a trade-off strategy Bono should have introduced selection system. in other words, those who want to listen to their music only can download them for free."
NBE04041,"I was surprised when I saw this article on the Internet. There are many people who blame Bono. However, I think that they must not blame Bono. Bono gave away U2's latest album for free, because he thought that many people will be happy about giving away the album for free. He want many people to be happy. So, we must not blame Bono."
NBE04046,"When I read the article, I thought giving away U2's latest album for free was not bad thing. Certainly, some people feel uncomfortable when the new album was automatically downloaded onto iTunes because of their tastes, and other may misunderstand they downloaded unknown artist's music by mistake. However, almost users wouldn't care about new music's and I think the new album does no harm, because if someone don't like them, they should delete new album. Bono had no malice, so they don't have to be blamed so much."
NBE04051,"This news interested me so much. I didn't know this article. At first, I thought this attempt would make all people, whether they are fans or not. Because of freebie, they need not pay any money. They can listen to their songs at free. However, I was to consider this attempt is no favor at all. Some fans might be happy, but those who are not interested in this artist must be unhappy. Because they don't need these songs and may not hear forever. More consideration might have needed for Bono."
NBE04103,"I think U2 didn't do bad thing because it is freebie and they can remove the album from their iTunes account. It isn't good to take up valuable strange space certainly, but people who like U2's music will be glad. Not only U2 but also Apple should apologize to iTunes user for their own careless system."
NBE04084,"I think the same way as you. I don't use iTunes so I know little about that, but the strange is so important for us. In addition, if you use them to your daily works, it's more important to you. I want that the same thing never happen."
NBE04027,"When I signed iTunes without knowing the download, I wasn't aware of the downloading. So I was very surprised the news as you. I want to have Apple never do such action."
NBE04090,"I think that this news is a problem about intellectual property rights. Apple must not made such a system. Because, artists don't enough to be protect. If iTunes's security is stronger, this trouble didn't happen. I think Apple should apologize to iTunes user and U2."
NBE04040,"I think what U2 did was not so bad because it was a chance that would make people who have never known about U2 realize a new fantastic artist. When you find that U2's new album is automatically downloaded for free, you will be confused at first. First of all, you should try to listen to the album. If you have really taken to them, this action of U2 is good, on the other hand, if you have no interest in them, you can delete them. This is a strategy. I think this is good for you to know a new fantastic artist for free."
NBE04039,"I watched the CM of U2's new album for free on iTunes on TV, so I was not so surprised at this news, but in my first time watching the CM, I was so surprised because U2 is world famous rock group. I think that that is not so bad thing because if I did not know U2 at that time, I tried to listen to the album for free."
NBE04022,"I also think this automatic freebie is not so bad. Bono got a chance of making widely known, and of course he made good use of it. This is a natural thing, so we should not blame him."
NBE04059,"Your opinion is good, though I think i in part disagree with it. As you say, It may be true that the freebie action which they did functioned as expanding our music experience. Yet I insist that it was much different from campaigns that are done on the street. They violated ""personal areas"" that surely exist in the Internet. It is like in real life they invade your home and thrust the album independently of your will. In this point, I think what they did was quite serious."
NBE04017,"After I read this article, I checked my iPhone's music application. There are several U2's songs. I didn't realize it before I read this, so I was very surprised. The problem of this article is security quality of Apple. I think the trouble in this article is important but isn't so much dangerous, because it is only downloaded automatically by Apple. However, we can assert that Apple's security system is careless. If Apple flow out personal information, it would be more important and dangerous problem than this article's one. So Apple should improve its security system."
NBE04102,"I didn't know the CM. If I can listen the music that I have never known for free, I am very glad. I also think that is not so bad thing."
NBE04093,"I believe it is wrong for only U2 to be criticized, too. However, I don't think automatic freebie is a good idea. In fact, this system may take up valuable iPhone storage space. Because I use Android Phone, I do not know the iPhone in detail. But, according to what I heard, this seems to be an annoying thing. That's why I am against your opinion."
NBE04070,"Your opinion is so good! The thought did not hit to me. U2 surely succeeded as an advertisement strategy. Judging from such a viewpoint, there is not the reason to apologize for."
NBE04020,"I was surprised when I read your comment because you wrote that you had signed in iTunes and actually you had gotten the U2's album!!! I don't use the iTunes so don't know well about it, but I understood how you were surprised when that happened. Anyway, I agree with you in that it's not good to be downloaded automatically."
NBE04052,"I sympathize with your comment. I think that not only Bono but also Apple apologize to people who are iTunes users. Apple should prepare the way people can select whether the album download or not . So following the way, people who get angry about taking valuable space of download and the way the album erase themselves don't angry like that."
NBE04077,"I agree with your two opinions. This is because it was able to understand a thought not only it troubled not only many general people, but also other singers and bands. When people of the world become egocentric, you may imagine easily that we will confuse. In addition to their action having confused people, you must not forget to have had possibilities to be a chance to do the thought that other people are egocentric either. That's why, their action was so bad as you say."
NBE04011,I agree with your opinion. Apple also should apologize for consumers and give choice whether they download latest U2's album or not.
NBE04072,"These days I can not keep up with the improvement in technology. However I think that people giving receiver something that receiver does not want is so rude. Soliciting papers, cult, coercive selling etc. . . should we notice ' No Hawkers or Salesmen' online? The Internets are full of ads! I can not stand it."
NBE04050,"I agree with this opinion. When I heard this news firstly, I was surprised. However as this opinion said, I could not think this problem is familiar to me because I also don't have iPod, iPhone and iPad."
NBE04082,"I wonder why there are new songs on my iTunes list though I did not download any music on iTunes. After read this article I could solve this problem. The songs automatically downloaded is lucky for someone, but it might be trouble for many people. In my situation, there is enough storage in my computer, so this songs is not big influence for me. But if there is little storage in computer it is big problem for the computer user. I think this artist did this action for good faith. But we must consider other people before do any actions."
NBE04085,I understand your stance a lot. The valuable shortage of iTunes could decrease by album which I am not interested in are so bad. Apple and U2 should apologize.
NBE04003,"I think your criticism is inaccurate and moreover misses the point. This delivery service is caused by U2. So, U2's property rights are not violated. This is U2's advertising strategy. I think it is interesting departure in advertising strategy. Of course, U2 doesn't need to apologize."
NBE04008,"Given the optimistic, so it might be good. However, iTunes users are downloading pay money and download music. If music you do not know is entered people's iPhone, it will be surprising That's too bad."
NBE04074,"When I read your accurate opinion, I can understand this article deeply. I also think it is a bad side of it to download automatically. I can understand the people who griped that the record took up valuable iPhone storage space. However, it is a great strategy of Apple to provide people using iTunes with the record for free."
NBE04088,"I approve with your opinion. We must consider other people's situation and feelings. It is very important thing. Also I think all of us should take to heart this complication. Bono's complication is large scale and have influenced lots of people in the world. But in daily life, there are many like instances. So we should not think this complication is not related to our daily life."
NBE04035,"I agree with your opinion. I also can understand Bono's idea. He must have considered this idea as best means to everyone listen his songs freely. Although he should apologize to users, he shouldn't be blame so."
NBE04016,"I thought that their this scheme is very selfish and troublesome. In addition to this, their explanation, ""deep fear that these songs that we poured our life into over the last few years might not be heard"", is very childish and deserves a disgust. There are so many singers or artists who are afraid that their works won't be paid attention to and bought at all. But they are trying to make a good thing with a sense of fear. As long as they are professional, they have to make effort to create terrific and worthy things."
NBE04075,"I do not agree with you so much. We have human rights what kind of music we listen, so I think some people would be unpleasant and it is not good that Bono give away the album even if it is free of charge."
NBE04057,"It is a difficult problem in these days that the Internet has spread. Such problems can be occurred at any time. In this case, this problem just happened to the famous and popular Irish rock band and caused heavy damage, so it created a great sensation, I think."
NBE04100,"I agree with you in terms of the trouble of storage, so I think they should have sent their music not automatically but able to choose."
NBE04105,"I have been convinced to your opinion. The right to choose will be required even if download is no charge. The album of U2 downloaded also to my ipod. I was dissatisfied, seeing it. If I did not download, supposing it was able to choose. And probably, dissatisfaction was not felt, either."
NBE04065,"I agreed with your opinion too. It is true that iphone users including me were at a loss what action they should do. They might lose their temper, but in terms of U2, they only want to know everyone their music. Thus, we iphone users should understand their feelings."
NBE04080,"When I read the article, I could understand what had occurred to my iTunes finally. I had been so surprised to see the album on my iTunes which I hadn't had any memories to buy, and then thought ""It must be my mistake. . . oh, I waste my money. "" So I was relieved when reading the article, but the same time I also felt the system bothered me because the album fill some capacity of my pc and iPhone."
NBE04007,"I think this kinds of free downloading is part of advertisements. Because these musics are free and if you do not like it, then you can throw it. So you do not have to keep it. Also iTunes is the service of Apple. Apple is independent company. So they can do whatever they want for their customers. Of course, sometimes this kind of troubles would happen. But it should be accepted."
NBE04079,"I disagree your opinion, because ""to delete"" is a very trouble work for me. Please imagine the situation, not only U2 but many artists adopt the system. In your iTunes and iPhone, there will appear many strange albums. The capacity will fill instantly, and you have to delete them. Isn't it so trouble?"
NBE04091,"I was not able to understand this problem, either. From the campaign of Apple, profits of 100 million dollars are produced and, seemingly, 26 million download was attained. But, like of you, there are some users who are not pleased that their memory is used freely. I think that it was put on the advertising strategy."
NBE04031,"After reading this news, I became aware of U2 and listened to songs of their new album I got in my iPhone. Considering it, Bono's strategy is very effective. And by expressing apology, he tried to restore public confidence. I think he is clever."
NBE04032,I have same opinion. I thought Bono should not have made his music downloaded in iTunes of many people and I was surprised that Bono could do such thing.
NBE04005,"I think so too. Nowadays, streaming music is in currency. It will be normal to keep the music you like and throw away the one you do not like."
NBE04018,I agree with you. They are professional singer. So they should make effort to make good staff by their own.
NBE04033,"I have already known that U2's latest album has sent to individual's iTunes because i also have given the music automatically. But, I don't think this is such a big problem in the world. so I think apple should take responsibility for this problem. Of course, Bono has some responsibility. But, if the control system of iTunes worked well, the problem didn't cause. iTunes should make the rule more strict."
NBE04098,"I agree with your opinion. If the same things happen to me, I will be confused and won't feel good."
NBE04028,"I myself like U2's music since I was little because my father also likes U2. I personally think that everyone should listen to the stuff before saying it's a rude act or something like that. However, from others point of view, it is certainly a rude act that they were sent a music they did not want. I want those people to know how marvelous U2's music is."
NBE04068,"I think the deed which U2 did is not bad thing. New album of U2 is free and is not annoyance for most people. But apples give people who use iTunes a choice which download or not. Personally I like U2 , so i'm happy."
NBE04060,"I agree with you. At first, I also wondered why there was the album on my iTunes account. In my case, I enjoyed listening their album, but I think some were angry with it. So I also think Apple should have given users alternatives whether they downloaded the album or not."
NBE04045,"I agree with your opinion. If people don't like these songs, they can delete these songs. So, I think it's not their faults. Moreover, the whole capacity in the iTunes is huge enough to memorize a lot of songs. People should not care of these songs."
NBE04047,"I agree with your opinion. I don't have iTunes account, but if I had iTunes account, I would be disgusted and angry to apple."
NBE04029,I totally agree with you. U2 is one of the best bands in the world. There musics are wonderful.
NBE04096,"I think so, too. I think Apple shouldn't ignore this situation."
NBE04015,I agree with you. U2 should have given away their latest album to those who were eager to listen to their songs.
NBE04043,"I was surprised and glad when I read this article. That is because I can get U2's album for free. As to problem, I think this is not so bad like such. Moreover U2 is very popular artist all over the world. I can't understand why this problem was so serious all over the world. But certainly, If I don't like U2 much or hate U2, My opinion might have changed. Much of criticism may be from such people who don't like U2 much."
NBE04042,I agree with you. I think he want many people to be happy too. I don't understand why this thing or he is criticized by a lot of people all over the world.
NBE04056,"Hearing this news, first, I could not what U2 wanted to do. Without doing such a fool thing, U2 is popular and a good band and I am one of U2's fan. Because of this free download , u2 and apple got a lot of money , I heard. It is very rude. I hope no artist does such a thing , including U2. By the way I was also surprised that young people do not know U2."
NBE04054,"Hearing this news, first, I could not what U2 wanted to do. Without doing such a fool thing, U2 is popular and a good band and I am one of U2's fan. Because of this free download , u2 and apple got a lot of money , I heard. It is very rude. I hope no artist does such a thing , including U2. By the way I was also surprised that young people do not know U2."
NBE04025,"If I can get my favorite artist's album, I would be glad. However, U2 and Apple should not do that because it was rude thing. Their act made people who do not like U2 angry."
NBE04024,"I agree with you. If same things happen to me, I will not feel good too."
NBE04092,"I approve this idea. Because the recipient can touch new music for free of charge, people get new music for free of charge. So I estimate the idea very highly. It is true getting the music for the person who doesn't need is very troublesome. But it's a very lucky thing for a person who needs the music conversely. I have mistaken u2 for a virus. I want a preliminary report from the next!!!"
NBE04038,"I agree with you. I think it is wrong that only U2 is criticized because Apple made the system of free access. Also, It was good thing because people who do not know U2 can listen to their music easily."
NBE04067,I completely agree with you. I'm sad when I think how shocked U2's members were. I extend their sympathy to them.
NBE04055,"I don't agree with you. Of course, U2 gave away his latest songs, but he got a lot of profit with Apple. U2 made some people happy, but more people were confused by what he did."
NBE04108,"I did not know this news so when I read this article, I was so surprised. It's terrible. However if I can download music freely, I would feel happy."
NBE04107,I agree with you. I think Apple should have given users alternatives whether they downloaded the album or not.
NBE04004,"I think that this is an irrelevant opinion. First, advertising is selfish in a basic way. U2's method is a clear advertising strategy. So, we unilaterally receive information. It seem to selfish is not surprising. Second, U2 is not impolite. Their method is legitimate form of advertising. Other bands should use the same technique as U2."
NBE04071,"I don't know U2, too. so I have same opinion. I think that this event is commercial, so Apple which admitted it is bad. But I have a good chance to know about U2."
NBE04037,I don't think he(or she) need to say that much about Bono! I can understand Bono's idea. He must have considered this idea as best means to everyone listen his songs freely. I don't think he is selfish.
NBE04087,"I think Bono's idea is good. It is because it charge free. I think If you don't have storage space in iPhone and PC, you just can delete this music. I agree with Bono."
NBE04034,I think some people would be unpleasant and it is not good that Bono give away the album even if it is free of charge.
NBE04081,"I didn't know the news before I read this in this class. However, I am the iTunes user, so I am interested in the detail. Also, It was possible that I was drawn this problem actually. Now, the iTunes users are increasing in the world. In this case, the album was distributed for free. I think that iTunes should make the rule secure."
NBE04064,"I agree to her opinion, there are two reasons. First, I also think that it is wrong for only U2 to be criticized. Second, the reasons are same as mine."
NBE04030,Why didn't he just try to listen to the music? U2 is one of the most famous singer in the world.
NBE04010,"I do not think "" this problem was caused by U2's thoughtless action. "" This campaign was carried out on iTunes of Apple. So, I think U2 wanted to widen their music, but Apple was a little brute force."
NBE04013,I also strongly think Apple should give choice whether they download latest U2's album or not.
NBE04097,"I think so, too. I don't use iTunes. But if it happen to me, I get into panic such as ""I bought an album without being noticed. ""."
NBE05800,"I was kind of aware that the song which I never had bought was on my iTunes. I don't think that is the bad idea to put their music on everyone's iTunes account automatically, but they should have given us the options. In that way everybody could have been so happy."
NBE06509,"This news is very hot one for me. One day, when I listened to my music in my usual way, the unknown song started suddenly. I thought my iPhone was corrupted at that time. Certainly, like many people, I griped at consuming iPhone's storage without my permission and U2's arrogant action. But the just thing made my feeling bad is what Apple can make our iPhones downloaded things automatically. I want Apple not to do such a thing from now on."
NBE06633,I agree with you in terms of the trouble of not only storage but also sending data files.
NBE06001,I have known this news before I read . But I had to downplay the problem. So I recognized as a serious problem. There is a need to improve by Apple. And we have to be careful by ourselves
NBE06416,"I didn't know this information. I learn much information when I read this article. I have iPhone but I do not use iTunes. Thus I do not know the system of iTunes in detail, but I knew that, to add musics of iTunes to Podcasts, we must pay for them. However, in this case, the album was distributed for free. I think both the artist and Apple should take responsibility for them"
NBE05494,It is rude for U2 artist to have their album free. They sing for live. They give us their worth of their music. I think we should try to take account into this truth.
NBE04109,"I cheered Oscar Pistorius in the Olympics. Though he has artificial legs, he did a great job and made a deep impression on the world. I am sorry that the hero turned into murderer. I think he never gets back to track and field athlete. Sports give us courage and hope, so I will not want to see any athletes be in court again."
NBE04114,"I think so too. I cheered he, so this time I am disappointed a lot. He can run so fast and he gave big courage and expectation to people who have handicap. he should introspect a lot."
NBE04111,"When I heard this news for the first time, I was so shocked. Oscar Pistorius is one of the famous athlete in Parlympic. Such a wonderful person change to cruel murder suspect now. I feel so sad. Besides, I can't assent to Masipa's rule, non-custodial sentence. Although he is the disabled, I think he should undergo heavy punishment."
NBE04115,"When I heard the news on TV, I was shaking with terror. He seems to use the STEROID which cause the state of dementia. And more, He is trigger happy. So bad conditions are completed. . . . I hope that a tragedy like this doesn't occur again."
NBE04112,"I am also sorry that he became a murderer. I hope he will get back to track, and give us courage again."
NBE04110,"When I heard this news, I was shocked because I had been impressed by his participation in Olympic race. But I think the shortest 10 months in jail is too light because he killed person."
NBE04113,I was shocked to hear the news. Because I watched his run in London London Olympic and was touched by. So I wanted him to give to hope to all disabled runners. But murder is a serious crime. So I think his penal servitude is too light. I hope more heavy punishment.
NBE04129,"Since I had the image that Canada was safe, this incident surprised me. I am regret that the criminal who is key person of this incident has died. The same incident may occur in Japan. I think that Japan does not have a sense of crisis of terrorism. By getting to know this incident, the Japan house should also strengthen the watch to terrorism."
NBE04120,Attacks such as religious terrorist shootings gives a terrible impact on our society and people's lives . I think think that 's a very big blow that the important figures of the terrorists had killed without catching. I think that many countries need to raise the level of the terrorist measures and Japan also do not think it is someone else's business.
NBE04128,"I think that this news surprised a Japanese. This is because Canada has not a dangerous image such as the Middle East. I also thought that Canada was a safe country. However, this image completely changed by this incident. At the same time, Japan came to have to think about terrorism seriously, too. The standby alert for other countries such as North Korea may be surely set. But, I think that Japan must raise the level of the terrorist about from the specific thought group except the country."
NBE04126,"I was surprised at this news so much. I have been to Canada once. When I visited there, I thought how quiet place here is and how peace Canada is. Thus this news about gunman astonished me so much. In addition to that, I think we could understand the seriousness of ISIS. ISIS problems will expand more and more. Other countries like USA, UK, Japan and so on should take some measures."
NBE04119,"In this article, there are two interesting point. At first, how many people believe that Canada is safe place. I can deny this strongly. It is because Canada allows people to have their own guns although the system is so strict. Moreover Canada is next to the US In such a society, we always have to watch out the danger. Second, Canada isn't like his next country. If this kind of thing happened in his next country, he should return to his enemy soon and essentially. However, he didn't do such thing. I think his next country have to learn his attitude."
NBE04127,"I agree with your opinion. I also thought Canada is the safety and peaceful country. It is necessary for Canada to identify why this terrorism happened and to keep people from taking such cruel action again. Then, Japan has the possibility to occur horrific terrorism. Now Japan has strict rules about gun, so gun fight hardly takes place in Japan. However, terrorist might attack people by harmful chemical weapon as Aum Shinrikyo. We have to settle many problem existing Japan to prevent terrorism."
NBE04116,"I was very surprised to read this article, because I did not have an image which Canada is involved in terrorism. Even a country which is safe, we cannot know when the country will be involved in International issues. Not to cause matter like this, many country include Japan have to tackle this problem."
NBE04117,"Though I think Canada is peaceful country, you must be surprised at this article from your experience. Your opinion is persuasive enough. I wish this diplomatic issue can be solve as possible."
NBE04122,"When I read this article, I was really surprised because I thought Canada was as safe as Japan. However the terrible terrorism has occurred in Canada, so I think it is possible to happen such as a terrorism in Japan. So far, the terrorism seldom occur because there is a strict gun control in Japan, so that it is difficult for Japanese to image about it. If the incident happens, they will not correspond with it. In order to correspond with it, we must know this news and whenever the terrorism happens. Government should solve this problem in cooperation with other countries."
NBE04118,"When I heard about this news, I was very surprised at it because I have imagined that Canada was a peaceful country. Also, this news indicate that Islamic State is a menace to world peace. All the country should cooperate with and control IS's menace."
NBE04123,I have thought Canada is peace and there is no conflict by the time I read this article. So I was so surprised to read this article. Attacks such as religious terrorist were threat to us because these attacks point to people who are only general citizen. We have to take measures as soon as in Japan.
NBE04124,I totally agree with you. I have thought Canada is peace and there is no conflict by the time I read this article. So I was so surprised too.
NBE04125,"I agree with you. In truth, Japan is safe compared with other country. But we should be alert every time as you say, because there isn't complete safe zone all over the world."
NBE04121,"I was so surprised and scared because I had an image that Canada is peaceful place and there were no terrorists. "" There will have no heaven. "" I got strong impression from this speech. We, all the countries should fight with Islamic's menace."
NBE04136,"When I was high school student, I was taught what AED is like and how to use it. However, I think many people have never used it in this kind of real traffic accidents and maybe it is not clear if we can behave quickly and use it properly. In an emergency situation, I think most of us will be upset and cannot behave bravely, but after reading this article, we should do that to help people's lives! In this news, ""chikan"" made it difficult problem when a man was about to cut through the woman's clothes. It is very serious problem, however, in my opinion, we should not care about that because I think it's much more important to save the injured and we must hurry!!! Therefore, it's true that I can understand what the driver of the vehicle said but I agree with the man who saved the woman. This case would have happy end but anyway, I think the government should improve the training about using AED at schools."
NBE04153,"I think AED should say that even people who may not have been received training can use. Almost all people will be unwilling at first, but in the emergency situation people around patient needs speedy action to rescue him or her , so we have no time confused. Therefore we need understand AED can be used by anyone, and we can't waste even a minute."
NBE04142,"I just feel sorry for the man who saved the woman's life despite all the troubles. And this news makes me think that we should learn more about how to use AED. Ignorance can make a serious problem. In this case there were no victims, but the woman might have been killed by the driver's inappropriate ""sense of justice"" if he prevented the man from using AED earlier and more forcibly. Most of us are taught how to activate AED, yet do not know how to use it properly. So, from now on, more concrete training should be given to citizens so that we can deal with the difficult situation as in this story."
NBE04130,"This news promotes negative behavior. It's really too bad. I want to praise his efforts. We should get knowledge of the correct use of AED. And, we must know to use an AED as soon as a sudden cardiac arrest happens. I hope everyone act without hesitation."
NBE04139,"I have heard the news and been sympathized with the man who try to save the women. The fact that there is a person who don't know how to use AED and call the police officer is very surprising. I was taught the way of AED in schools and driving schools. Unhappily, such things may make other people be unwilling to use AED. AED is effective. We must not make atmosphere that you cannot use without hesitation. Today, people are too sensitive. We should become more generous."
NBE04148,"when I read this article, I was shocked. It is because the man who try to save women's life questioned by police. This is very poor thing. Definitely if I was driver, I would think like this too. But this mean I don't know correct use of AED. We must know how to use AED correctly and help each other."
NBE04145,I felt sad when I read this article. This is because there are some cases where kind intentions bring about unfortunate results. I think it is not good that the driver did not trust the man's kind behavior. Eventually this incident does not have bad result because the driver has understood that his idea had been just a misunderstanding and this case would make us not hesitate over whether we can use AED for women in emergency or not.
NBE04146,"I think it is very foolish act. The driver should realize what the man did is correct by the accident situation and trust the man's kind behavior. these days, there are AED in many places. AED automatically explain how to it by themselves for someone who have not known how to use it. But as I learned how to use and what AED is in high school health education class, people should know the basics of AED using. We can not know when we encounter such a life saving situation."
NBE04144,"I agree with you. I also think his action is really courageous and admirable. It is good for this country to increase a kind man like him, so we have to understand how to use AED and we are prepared for this situation."
NBE04147,"I think that we can realize what the man do for the injured woman is correct by the situation of the accident. Anyway, I agree that your opinion that we must know how to use AED correctly. It is because we don't know when we encounter such a life saving situation."
NBE04152,I think the number of people who have right knowledge is too small. I think we must now the way for using AED in order to save human's life. We will be able to criticize the person who act rightly like him because of lack of knowledge.
NBE04135,"I was very surprised after read this article. I think when we compare to rescue a person with fear to be called ""Hentai"" or ""Chikan, "" I will choose rescue. I can't understand why people who is an acquaintance with person who was rescued say such a terrible thing. They should rather say ""Thank you!"" I believe it is normal to choose rescuing person who is injured. So, I have no idea why they didn't choose it."
NBE04149,"In our daily life, it is often occurs to jump to wrong conclusions. But we should not hesitate to take brave action to save a human life. As this article says, saving life is more vital than feeling shame at blaming as Hentai or chikan. Unfortunately the man was mistaken for pervert when he was trying saving a woman's life. we should take bold actions when it is needed."
NBE04138,"Students of this generation receive the training of AED, therefore we all know that we have to remove any clothing when applying AED. It is shocking to me that people who don't know the appropriate use of the AED takes the action in the wrong way and even report it to the police. If the lady was in more serious condition, she would have been dead. One reason why the driver mistook his action is that he didn't know how to use the AED, and another is that a lot of pervert occur in Japan. Because perverts are not now unusual, people would think it's a pervert if a man was taking a woman's clothes off. It is a shame as a Japanese to even think someone would do such thing at a scene of car accident. I hope more people know about AED and people would trust others."
NBE04131,"I agree with you. However, Ido not think that a lot of people can do such brave things. Nobody want to take responsibility if people who he or she aided dies. We have to do a drastic reform about lifesaving."
NBE04151,"I have learned how to use AED at the driving school, but I don't have any confidence in using AED correctly. I think everyone should learn how to use AED because everyone could face the situation where they have to save someone's life. However, the number of people who can use AED correctly is very small , so local government should do something to solve this problem."
NBE04143,"We students are taught how to use AED in our school. So we can roughly use that apparatus. But in our daily life, we are surrounded by the irrational atmosphere. This case is one of them. Thus this is so difficult a problem. But the man's brave action saved the precious woman's life. So this man's action should be ranked."
NBE04155,"I agree with you! When I was a junior high school student, I have been thought about usage of AED a little. However, I have just been thought in a PE class a few times and I don't remember it well. Therefore, maybe I can't behave bravely and help a person who is in a serious condition if I was in an emergency situation. I think that the government and schools should improve the training about using AED, too."
NBE04156,"I pitied this man to read this article. I was impressed by his bravery and judgment! Probably, if I was in a serious situation like this, I couldn't take action as him. I think there are few people who can take action like him in Japan. I think that the government and schools should improve the training of using AED positively. Then, people who can judge bravely and use AED exactly with confidence will increase more. I hope that such people increase and I want to such person, so I want to learn about the saving of life and using AED."
NBE04154,"I want to learn how to use AED accurately too. If people who can use AED increase, more people will be helped. However, even if we know the way to use it, we will get into a panic. So I respect people who treat correctly like the man."
NBE04132,"I feel sorry for the man in this story. He wanted to save woman's life and he put into action to save her life. I think that he is brave enough to be regarded with admiration. However, people who saw what was happening called the police ! All we have to do is to inform people of accurate knowledge about AED in order to save such a brave man."
NBE04134,I agree with you. Man who rescue the driver act correctly. Why man should be criticized? Moreover driver learned about hoe to use AED not only in high school but also in a driving school. I can't understand this driver's behavior.
NBE04133,"Action of driver of the vehicle and the police officer is quite unbelievable. I have learned when and how to use the AED at the high school, so it's natural for us to estimate almost all high school students can deal with the AED. However, driver and police officer, both adult, didn't understand the situation and even criticized man's brave action. I think not only students but also adults have to learn what is the AED and why and when the AED is needed so we can use it to help others' lives without hesitation."
NBE04140,"Action of driver and police officer is very terrible. Kind man's help means nothing to them. I know how to use AED. However citizen as me even know this, I can't unbelievable that police officer doesn't know how to use AED. AED is very important thing. This machine can be life saver and killer. Our understanding to this machine is valuable."
NBE04141,I feel sorry for the man who saved the woman with AED. People should correctly know various instruments that save human's lives including AED. What the driver of the vehicle do is very poor. And the police too. They should change their conscious.
NBE04137,I can not believe this news because this man just saved the women's life but he was questioned. He should be appropriate for saving life. The driver and the police should apologize to him and they should know more about the AED.
NBE04150,"How to use AED is learned at school. But the person with using that actually is little. And the person who can manage AED perfectly would be little, too. If good will of the person who has that is judged by law, what should we make grounds?"
NBE04157,I feel sorry for the man in this story. It is because the man who try to save women's life questioned by police.
NBE04158,"I think so, too. We should know how to use AED and act without hesitation."
NBE05029,"I do not think it is a matter of lack of knowledge. Almost all Japanese school, they teach how to use AED. But they learn it without any reason. We need to take AED lecture more practically."
NBE05027,"I think his comment is good and can agree with his comment to an extent. But, I also think his notion is a little bit idealistic. Now, it is the era of the sensitivity, and it is inevitable considering the tide of the time."
NBE04162,"I think that his action is too rash. Participating in the war freely in Syria is bringing about confusion in Japan. Although Japan has the Self-Defense Forces, it never does such action. Also he participated as a combatant of the radical Islamic group which has had big influence all over the world so I think that it is unavoidable that he is recognized as a person antisocial by the Japanese government."
NBE04169,"I was surprised Japanese person converted to Islam and fought at Islam war. At the same time , I feel so sad. Because the era is people can fight easily. He is so selfish at the point which he go back Japan as having a dangerous experience. On the hands sly loan people can't run away. He acted only the reason that he want to know what life and death were . He want to go and fought at Islam. As he was satisfied , next he go back to Japan. His action like that is careless. I was worried about having an effect on Japanese people who long to fight. He should do something to finish wars many things for Syrian people , making use of his special experience."
NBE04168,"I was surprised Japanese person converted to Islam and fought at Islam war. At the same time , I feel so sad. Because the era is people can fight easily. He is so selfish at the point which he go back Japan as having a dangerous experience. On the hands sly loan people can't run away. He acted only the reason that he want to know what life and death were . He want to go and fought at Islam. As he was satisfied , next he go back to Japan. His action like that is careless. I was worried about having an effect on Japanese people who long to fight. He should do something to finish wars many things for Syrian people , making use of his special experience."
NBE04181,"I think the happiness cannot be decided by anyone but the person himself. , so if a man seem to be happy because of his status or property, maybe he does not feel he is happy. In Japan, I think there are many people who feel unhappy despite of their objective happiness. The man in this news is one of such people, and he want the meaning of his presence. I want him to know that there are many people who have nothing and dread being implicated in war."
NBE04179,"I cannot understand his action and thought. Participating in the war voluntarily means that to go to seek the death in danger. I think the era that he has been bullied creates him now. I was sad when I read this article. It is impossible for me that there is Japanese who want to participate in the war. The drift of Japanese is toward against war. It is because that Japan has experienced many hardships by many of the victims of the war. However, I think that his remark, ""Most adults have no idea what goes on in the real world"", is not wrong. We talk about world affairs without knowing the real world. It is the most important to face to the real world on discussing the international situation. I hope that there is no war from this world."
NBE04176,"I cannot understand that he thinks. He proceeds to the battle front to fight naturally. It brings Japan confusion and will have some influences on the world. If there is the basic cause for bullying, it may be a serious problem. I don't know the small international situation, but the war may be taking place from the imminent place."
NBE04175,I agree to your opinion. There will be a lot of people feeling uneasy to hear this news. I will have an influence on the world by his careless action as well as Japan. Such an action is very dangerous in the world where does not know what happens. It hide possibility to cause big damage to not only oneself but also another person. I think that a careful action is demanded anytime when I have anything to do with the world.
NBE04160,"I think Japanese should think the conflicts between Islam and Christianity. Japanese traditional religions do not have features of Monotheism. And Islam is not familiar in Japan. So what we must do now is to study the Koran and fully understand it. After that, Japanese would understand Islamic State is not based on the way of Islamic thinking. So it is suspicious the existence of IS itself. I want to ask him that he really understand Islam and what he does. I think he does not. when we communicate with foreign people. It is necessary to understand the ethos of them. And in their backgrounds, there are always religions."
NBE04167,"I can not understand his feeling. The life is more important than any other thing for me. I think that Syria is a very dangerous place, so his action is unbelievable for me even if he has any reason."
NBE04180,"When finished reading the article, I took his words, ""Japan is a Galapagos society. Most adults have no idea what goes on in the real world. "" very seriously. I cannot image his fierce experiences and the situation completely, but I can know these facts by reading books, hearing people and watching TV etc. We, live in a peace and Galapagos society don't seem to pay attentions to such situation of the world. However, we should do that to know the real world, and think what we can do for that."
NBE04159,"I was surprised at there was the person who committed a crime of Preparations or Plots for Private War. Surely it is important to see what happens in the world by our own eyes, but he crossed a line that shouldn't be crossed. He should have choked back personal desire, and I think it is not for him to participate the war, but to embark on ridding the war."
NBE04165,"When I read article, I was so surprised, and I cannot understand his action. Almost of people around the world do not want to take part in a war. Nevertheless, he tried to take part in a war. I really cannot understand his action and feeling. I think that he must respect his life in any circumstances."
NBE04164,I agree with your opinion. I think that there are a little people who can understand his action and feeling. He must respect his life in any circumstances.
NBE04166,"I think his behavior is too reckless and too childish. In a war, not only soldiers but also civilians are in danger, so it's best if we can avoid such a dangerous situation. Nothing is more precious than human's life. However, he went to Syria, the belligerent nation and he would be helping to kill people. I can't understand what he thinks. Whatever he assert, I never agree with his action."
NBE04163,"I was surprised Japanese person converted to Islam and fought at Islam war. At the same time , I feel so sad. I can't understand his actions and behavior. I hope that there is no war from this world."
NBE04173,"I respect of Mr. Uzawa because he is really active and brimful of intellectual curiosity. Converting to Islam is little going too far , but I reconfirm that having much of life makes a person of great depth."
NBE04161,"I was so surprised that Japanese man fights at the Islam war and I respect him. However, I hate the war so I hope the war will be vanish."
NBE04182,"I read Asahi Shimbun, and learned about this news. When this article in a general news page, I was a lot surprised. It's because it wasn't believed that one ordinary Japanese youth goes to a trouble area personally. The behavior which doesn't think back to such danger threatens the life of the youths. I don't know whether the relief disposal is in Japan. But it may be the one which is when Japan thinks why the youths go to a trouble area."
NBE04177,He just should be the member of the SDF If he likes fighting. I cannot understand his idea. His action is illegal in our country. Why should he go to Syria? I think the root of this issue is the social structure of Japan. Japanese young people have few money. Young people cannot make dreams and disappoint with the society. I think this is not a personal problem but social problem in Japan.
NBE04178,"I agree your ideas but please let me to mention my thought. I, you and also other people would not like to join the war. However he does. Though we cannot understand his ideologies, we should not criticize them."
NBE04171,"This news was very shocking for me. We first surprised, it is that he could easily be in contact with the Islamic countries. This Tsu I indicates a problem that is happening in Islam that we also are familiar. Such a conflict in the Middle East was surprised to second longer it is that it has become not what religious. This means that I said to be a negative legacy was born by globalization. In any case, it must act accordingly to such incidents from occurring"
NBE04170,"I agree with you. Young people today, including he and I, do not what a war is like, so it some of them do not understand how dangerous and misery a war is. This incident shows us that there is possibility that Japan will be involved in war. we should make effort to protect it!"
NBE05025,"First, I am very interested in this article, so I have various feelings. His comment is the very comment which get my feeling. Moreover, as he said, ""It is the most important to face to the real world on discussing the international situation. "", this comment is very important for me."
NBE04172,"Surprise and ""Respect"" that sums it up. To begin with, I wish the war will come to an end. His vitality and belief are beyond my imagination."
NBE04275,"When I heard about this news for the first time, I was disgusted at it. I have often heard news about politics and money problem recently. I think it is not good that government stops by politicians' problems which shouldn't be took up in the Diet primarily. I was disgusted to see that members of the Diet quarrel about that a round bill is a fan or not. Mr Abe declare the slogan, ""the society women can play an active part in. "" Therefore he adopted no less than five female Cabinet ministers. However two ministers were forced into positions in which they must resign. It is sure that Mr Abe and the cabinet are in a difficult time."
NBE04206,"I was very surprised that such misconduct has occurred that some days aren't passed when the Minister of Economy changed. Ms. Obuchi resigned by being suspended that she has a funding scandal. When government elect the next Minister, I wonder why Abe Prime Minister didn't research the people who properly became a candidate. In the process of researching, government must find that the local secretary of Miyazawa had put out the unnecessary political activity costs. I thought it was really not have been made firmly ."
NBE04273,"The responsibility of the politician in this incident is large. I was disappointed about the politician having used money for self-interest. A politician tends to leave a report to a secretary. However, even if it does not know injustice, the politician has to take the responsibility. That is, the politician should worry about a subordinate's deed. Their resignation became a cause by which the approval rating for the prime minister fell. The politician should become prudent to use people's tax."
NBE04269,I was surprised at this news because the top politicians have less responsibility and abuse their expense. They were blinded by self-interest. Their work is not for themselves but for people. I think the politicians must remember the spirit that they started with and pride themselves for their work.
NBE04271,"Recently, scandal by politician occur frequently. I was offended when I watched they apologized for their mistake formality. And I was surprised at Mr Miyazawa's state that he himself did not go there at all. It shows he doesn't have no responsibility for members of his political group. I want not to watch such politician anymore. It's incredible to use tax from citizen. Management of money should be strict and voter need choose candidates more carefully."
NBE04366,"Whenever I hear a funding scandal of politicians, I lose a trust of politicians. I wish them to have more responsibility of their behaviors. The most thing I was surprised is a scandal that women were involved. One of prime minister Abe's goal is social advancement of women. However, the scandal like Ms. Obuchi's will become a reason to prevent from social advancement of women. Many politicians' relatives also are politicians. I think it is not good for modern politics. It is because that their relatives tell their opinions. It is of course not to change to better direction. I hope that such incident never happen again."
NBE04200,"I was so disappointed!!! This is my first impression when I heard about this news. Maybe many Japanese people have had enough of this kind of news, Japanese politicians' financial problems before. In this case, I was very surprised because this scandal about Yoichi Miyazawa came to light as soon as he was appointed the new economy, trade and industry minister. I really want them to have more responsibility towards their actions because they work as a leader of Japan. As for changing Japanese Prime Minister quickly, it's not good for Japan's impression from other countries. Moreover, I was very shocked about the news that Ms. Obuchi and Ms. Matsushima resigned because of financial problems. As this article says, this kind of thing prevents Mr Abe's goal of having more female representation in the upper echelons of government, and I really hope his goal will come true as a woman. Therefore, I think we should reconsider how the politicians behave and the system that have many family members. I think it should be changed to make them act correctly by their heart as a member of Japanese citizens, not by their family members' voice."
NBE04230,"I was shocked at two points of the article. First, representations of general people were occurred many bad problems. Although I think they are smart, I wonder why they behave dishonestly . Not to tell a lie and to follow rules are so simple and easy rule to understand and obey. Second , this cases were caused by two women of ministers. Mr Abe proceeds the plan having more female representations in the upper echelons of government. But, the problems such as this article made bad. Impression about the plan or females. I think the plan refer to a fundamental problem about sexism. And the plan is unnatural way. So I hope the world become gender neutral without unnatural support from a country."
NBE04263,"When I read this article, I was surprised very much. Politics and money problem are often reported recently. In the situation, It is a very sad thing that a case like this time happened. According to this article, it is said that Miyazawa oneself does not go to the JT007 bar. However, the problem is not whether Miyazawa went to the club but whether the money of politics was spent. By this case, Miyazawa resigned. Nevertheless, Ms. Obuchi resigned by the issue of political fund this time. The politics of Japan always betrays us. I want a politician to be aware that themselves support politics of Japan more."
NBE04252,"In these days, I hear much news that politicians' use taxes in wrong ways. This cse is also one of those news. Mr. Miyazawa said he did not go to the club but I think the most important point is not in whether he went there, but in the money used was paid by citizens. However, it is true that there are many cases like this. I think there are much more that we unaware of. I want him to regret that he should be more careful to his staffs' behavior, but, on the other hand, I cannot help but sympathize with him."
NBE04251,"I think so, too. He should apologize not for his behavior but for his carelessness. We will have right to vote soon so we should choose candidate carefully."
NBE04245,"When I heard this news, I was disappointed because this news was the same thing until now. After Mr. Abe became the prime minister, I thought to be reliable because there is no scandal, we were so surprised and it was a shock. However, I think that I want them to do their best that it is hopeless one to have got up and no longer loses the trust of the nation. I think that I want them to change conventional bad politics little by little from now on."
NBE04235,"I don't think that this news is so disappointing. It's nothing new. In our long, long political history, we have learned that politicians in Japan sometimes spend much money from their funds as ""political activities"" which seem unreasonable or ridiculous in common sense (for example, grand banquets in typical exclusive Japanese restaurants or expensive hot spring resorts, in order to hope for something like funding or cooperating in return) and realized that these activities are sometimes necessary. And this expense on a sex club is, though it might be a bit too dirty, surely a one of such activities. So, what is the matter? Since our nation's great and high-minded politicians have already eaten up our precious taxes more or less, is there any use in criticizing the expense alone? Rather, let's praise it for ""having spent only 18, 230 yen"" and ""not having wasted our taxes so much as in other political activities"" ! We citizens should not narrow our visions. In this case, we and mass media should have not focus on the word, ""expense on a sex club"" too much. The Diet has been in danger of losing its solid foundation. If we complain about trifles, it will surely delay its economical actions or diplomatic policies which are far more important than trivial, non-illegal scandals."
NBE04205,I agree with your comment. This deplorable scandal had a big influence all over Japan. It is a big blow that two female ministers resigned at once for Abe's cabinet.
NBE04202,"It is shameful that Japanese politicians quit their posts due to their scandal. Such an uproar is repeated and the confidence of Japanese government is undermined. The scandal of minister has no relation to prime minister directly, but Japanese people have a bad impression. I hope Japanese government will have strong support from the public."
NBE04216,I think that the Obuchi's scandal is the most serious problem because she could not understand how much money she used and the political fund is not hers. She must know her spending a lot of money and we must not choose a person who cannot control his or her money. Ms Matsushima should not quit her job because of trifling thing as Uchiwa.
NBE04254,"When I read this article, I though there are a lot of scandals by politician recently and I was very disappointed for Japanese political office. It is absolutely prohibit things to use tax for private use. The article says, Mr Miyazawa didn't go to club and his member went to. But I am skeptical about it. I strongly believe if people investigate more, a lot of scandals will revealed. I wish no scandals anymore."
NBE04198,"In Japanese politics, these problems what related to politicians and money often happened. Politicians are representations of citizens. So they should behave as such. However, they don't. I can't understand why politicians can not obey the law. It is sure that we citizens are also responsibility for election, but I think politicians are lacking in sense of responsibility. So, citizens should elect statesman carefully and people who want to be involved in politics should have more responsibility."
NBE04184,This is disappointing news. Trade minister Yoichi Miyazawa claims that he did not go to JT007 bar though this claim is irrational. His point detracts from the real issue. Politicians must spend a political fund for the national interest . It is democratic destruction to collect votes by spending a political fund. Therefore I can't permit not only Miyazawa but the scandal of Ms Obuchi too. She was involved in payoff scandal. I think she destroyed the faith to the democracy.
NBE04262,"I sympathize with your opinion. Recently, politician causes a problem too much. This is annoying thing fo us. Especially, there are a great many problems about the tax. I feel that a politician despises the nation. The politician should take responsibility even if a politician is not related to a problem directly."
NBE04270,I agree with you. The money paid by citizen should be used more carefully. We wouldn't be aware of other case. Politicians should feel a sense of guilt.
NBE04340,"The scandal of the Japanese politician is one of the news to hear well. However, the nation will have distrust for politics of Japan whenever we hear the news. The cabinet aiming at the social advance of the woman must be upset now, too. This is because a woman politician becomes a target of the scandal. I think that future correspondence is very important. I want you to try to never have such a thing."
NBE04201,"Recently, many people more focus on what a politician did in their private than what they will do in future. I think this tendency is not good. In this case , many people blame Miyazawa's secretary going to sexual club to have a talk with someone. In my opinion , we blame this opinion too much. I can't tell going to such a club to have a political chat from going to a bar to have a political chat. We have to realize that there is something more important than that."
NBE04199,"I agree with you in that the politician should have take the responsibility. As you wrote, they use the tax Japanese citizens paid, so they have to be more careful and become prudent to use it. I really hope they will never do that, and don't want to hear about such politicians' financial news any more."
NBE04191,"I was so disgusted about Mr. Miyazawa because his support group spent office money at a JT007 bar, which is a questionable place. Also I disappointed with Ms. Obuchi and Ms. Matsushima's resignation because I was looking for women legislators to take a lively part in the government. If they hadn't been concerned with their problems directly, they should have understood what their support group did and stopped their wrong doing."
NBE04190,I agree with your opinion. Government should research about candidates and their local secretary before electing the next minister.
NBE04244,"I think that the different opinion of your viewpoint is great. The action of the politician is not good, but I think their private is not protected. They must take action like politician, but I think that the life as the commoner should be promised. I think that we have to criticize the action of media."
NBE04229,"When I heard this news, I was disappointed so much. In these days, there are a lot of scandals related politicians. Ms. Obuchi and Ms. Matsushima resigned a few days ago. The reason why Ms. Obuchi resigned was she used money , which was political funds, for private. In addition to that, she said that she did not understand anything because her secretary took charge of all her money. Politics in Japan is in critical situation, I think. It should be changed as soon as possible."
NBE04228,I agree with this opinion. I also think that Ms. Obuchi could not understand how much money she used and her secretary took charge of her all money. Such a person should not be elected.
NBE04253,I agree with you. Recently Japanese politics are lacking in sense of responsibility. We should watch carefully how their money moved and make statements.
NBE04482,"When I know this article, I got angry with Japan minister who support staff spent office money at a sex club. This is because they spent unjustified expenses with taxpayer's money. Recently there are some scandal in Abe's cabinet. So my distrust of Abe's cabinet has been increasing since it happened. Moreover I think it is not enough that politicians take part in the government sincerely."
NBE04214,"When I read this article, I was so shocked. I had known resignation of two women ministers, but I had never thought that the successor, Mr. Miyazawa already had occurred scandal. Recently politicians often cause many scandals. Every time I hear such a news, I feel sad. They should carry out politics for the benefit of the nations instead of us. I hope that they will not disappoint us any more."
NBE04183,"I agree with you. Presence of the second-generation politicians means that preventing political reform. So, we should spot exceptionally capable politicians. I hope to get executed women's full participation in society."
NBE04186,"One could argue that a funding scandal of politicians is shameful and Japanese politicians need to be held accountable for chosen delegate. However, it won't get you anywhere to say something. Illegal diversion of the political fund is not the first time. New one will no doubt become apparent. It could be worse. I suspect there are a lot of financing problem which have yet to come to light. Specified Secrets Protection Bill will put this regulation into practice on December 10. I have qualms about restriction of the right to know and decreasing of funding issues out in the open."
NBE04189,"I think politician must be honest. Seeing recent political circumstances, if we may be able to find evidences against their policies. When I have read this article, I am disappointed the politician Although he explained that he did not have inappropriate money spending by himself, he was not able to mangy his staffs. He will be responsible for caring. Every one in Japan must regard spending money at SM bar as bad thing. I think I want a politician such this article to have morality."
NBE04258,"I thought politicians who are nationally representation should take the right course of action. Recently, politicians' scandal is reported well. People were disappointed the politician every time, and it has lost reliance. Since politician's scandals does not happen any more, we should continue supervising."
NBE04255,"I agree with your opinion. Politicians should be responsible for their own finance. In Ms. Obuchi's case, she escape from the explanation for her political money problem. But in reality, the Japanese political financial system cannot be changed. Before Ms, Obuchi 's problem was apparent, there have been lots of political financial problem. Moreover, political money problem is not a Japanese characteristic problem but a common problem all over the world. It is tremendously hard to prevent politicians from spending their public fundings illegally."
NBE04188,"I agree with your opinion. Such as this news, politician must be faithful and honest. betraying people's trust is especially that. This problem may be uneasy to solve."
NBE04256,"If the SM bar is admitted legally, visiting SM bar is not criticized. There are many kind of people who have uncommon sexual tendencies. Therefore, whether going to SM bar is decided by his own will. we cannot have the right to blame it. However, if the SM bar's spending is used from public funding or contribution, Mr. Miyazawa should apologize to people for spending money badly."
NBE04249,"After read this article, I was disappointed at this news because the top politicians do not have responsibility for their positions. It is completely out of the question that they use our tax for private using. They representative of Japanese citizen so I want them to more concentrate on their political works not on private amusement."
NBE04219,"It is no exaggeration to say that the latest politician scandal hit the prime minister Abe. Mr. Miyazawa was suspected that his political support group spent 18230 yen at the sex club. He emphasized he had never been there. Whether he went there or not , I think the Japanese people lost trust of him as well as other politicians. Moreover I think Mr. Abe is responsible for such scandals because the politicians were appointed by Mr. Abe. Many of politicians have no awareness of responsibility as representative. They should think what to do for country."
NBE04234,"The amount of money of the political fund that the staff of Miyazawa used the an SM bar is not so big, but in these days such as people investigate about the purpose for which money is spent of the political fund strictly statesmen should be discreetly, I think."
NBE04187,"I think the members of the cabinet should check the expenses of ministers and modify them if there are any faults. I have two reasons. First, it is done at the cabinet of Koizumi. And one of the members of them said yes it works well when PM chooses ministers. Second, funds such as slush funds of Legislators are necessary evil. Because when they want to do something in the diet, they should make political factions, or unite for a policy that they want to realize. Therefore, they use many funds without concerning they are legal or illegal. But without doing so, Japan's politics is not useful for Japanese. In my conclusion, we should rethink the personnel affairs."
NBE04213,"I agree with your opinion. I was so shocked when I read this article. I think also that top politicians have less responsibility. If his abuse were true, he also should resign."
NBE04233,"I think so, too. The situation of the cabinet goes to the direction where is reverse to the aim that is called ""activity of the woman"" the Mr. Abe advocated. It is very interesting how he'll deal with this."
NBE04196,"Since Mr. Miyazawa is a minister who are appointed due to the corruption of Ms. Obuchi, I thought he is reliable and irrelevant to disgraceful affairs. Therefore, I felt disappointed that the same thing was repeated. I think it will be more and more difficult for prime minister Shinzo Abe to keep supports and trusts by a people . Mr. Miyazawa have to reflect on this problem seriously and make every effort to regain a reliance"
NBE04250,Using our tax for private use is completely out of the question. They have no responsibilities for what they do. I want them to have realization of representative Japanese citizen.
NBE04266,"When I heard the news , I am surprised. I am surprised that officers who should observe the law invaded them. So we should observe officers' act."
NBE04272,I also approve of your opinion. A political fund belongs to national. Obuchi does not have the idea. She has to examine herself. Naturally she resigned. She lost public confidence.
NBE04268,I agree with you because I want the politician to do their duty and not to hurt their work's pride badly. I hope they won't do bad things any more.
NBE04223,I agree with your opinion. I think also that they are blinded by self-interest. I wish they work for citizens not for themselves.
NBE04365,I was surprised when I heard this news. However the point is not whether they paid on what kind of sex pub and so on but also they paid on private things. As a result people such as them limit to the rule due to their idleness! Why don't they care about others who works hard and seriously? Never make hard workers reluctant. They should be ashamed of themselves.
NBE04237,"I was really disappointed in the statesmen in Japan to when I read the article. Because they resigned for such scandals. But these days, there are a lot of funding scandals of statesmen. I think it is necessary to raise politics awareness among nations against that. In the first place, politics is for protecting our lives. So we should originally watch the current status of politics for ourselves. In other words, the scandal was caused due to shortage of awareness regarding politics among nations. So I think it is necessary to raise politics awareness among nations."
NBE04260,"i heard this news and was shocking. A bureaucrat and the minister should do appropriate work. Therefore, a third party should supervise them. I think that the third party is people."
NBE04238,"When I heard this news, I was not shocked. Because the relation between politics and money has been strongly played up by mass media. In my opinion, it is not good thing in terms of humanity, but in terms of politics, it is no use denying that deed"
NBE04247,"I think this is very sad news because these scandals will stop any good flows of political consequences. There have been many political problems in Japan, so we have no time to attend to these news essentially. And, I also felt these news seems to have an aspect of just power game. This is why I god so sad."
NBE04267,"When I heard this news at the first time, l feel angry. The most thing surprised me is Ms. Obuchi 's behavior. The cabinet of Abe is making efforts to enhance the stand of Japanese women, but Ms. Obuchi's action made that situation worse. I can't forgive her behavior as one of Japanese Women"
NBE04246,"I agree with your opinion. I'm fed up with these time of political news recently, and whenever I hear them, I have fears for the Japanese future. Many people also do that, I guess. These matter seem to be bullying of adults."
NBE04220,"When I read this article, I felt anger. Recently, I heard news that a statesman spent office money for his private many times. I cannot understand their feelings. I want the Japanese Government to take measures for problems like that, and I hope that another problem like that will not happen."
NBE04257,"I cannot allow her behavior too. Although female activity is delightful, I want to lose disgrace. We need to do our best as a Japanese woman of the future!"
NBE04227,"If what Miyazawa said is true, it is not responsible for him but stuff. I think it is a individual problem of the stuff, so Miyazawa does not have to resign."
NBE04439,I agree with you. I cannot forgive that staff from a support group spent office money at a sex club. There are many cases where Japan minister cause a scandal. I hope a scandal like this will not happen again too.
NBE04274,"I think so. Funding scandals of politicians are also treachery against the Japanese people. I think confidence in politicians is very important to be engaged in political activity. Therefore they must have more responsibility for their behaviors. Then, I think more people will come to have interest in politics and go to elections."
NBE04192,I agree with you. Mr. Miyazawa's support group wasted office money. Their money is a tax. The law regulates how to spend their money. He was chosen by the voters because they expect him to do what is good for them. They should have wasted their money.
NBE04210,"When I heard this news, I felt angry and thought they were not suitable for politician. But recently, I heard yuko Obuchi was allowed to run for election. I think it is citizen's duty to choose the person who is suitable for politician."
NBE04209,"I have same opinion. As politicians scandals is revealed, political party lost people's trust. Politicians should behave correctly."
NBE04241,"I agree to your opinion. I think the politician to have to be serious for the nation. However, I may not regain the trust of the nation if there is such a scandal. I do not want politicians to raise such a thing with twice."
NBE04185,I agree with your opinion. Some people's financial impropriety is not scruple to lead to suspiciousness against politician entirety. I hope a person of integrity become politician and politician doesn't be faithless.
NBE04224,"When I read this article, I was so shocked. I think that they are blinded by self-interest. I wish they work for citizens not for themselves."
NBE04197,"I think so too. Politicians are representative of citizens, so they should act with responsibility that they are elected. However, many politicians are lacking responsibility and they make us disappointed. We have to elect carefully."
NBE04212,"I was surprised at the news. In these days, I hear a lot of news that Japanese politician use tax in wong ways. Politicians should think about the figure which there should be of the politician. And the corruption of the politician should deal with a heavy punishment"
NBE04211,I agree with you. I want politicians to make good use of the tax of the country.
NBE04240,"Politics and money is an inseparable relationship . Politics needs big money and this money is given by private citizens. So, politician must control his money which use political activity exactly. If he himself doesn't know money which use illegally he must take responsibility for his administrative ability."
NBE04236,I agree to your opinion. And I feel sad when they resign their post because of trifling scandal. So I also think they should carry out politics for the benefit of the nations instead of us.
NBE04193,"I was disappointed to know this news. They wasted a lot of money collected by people. They had to spend their money to do something good for people supporting them. It is true that they have to collect a lot of money to take part in politics. However, I think that there is something wrong with their political sense. I want politicians to do clean politics."
NBE04225,"When I heard the news for the first time, I was disappointed deeply. Certainly, Mr. Miyazawa said he didn't go the club. However, it is not the crux about the problem. What he is to blame for is that he paid money for inappropriate things. This expense just lower his dignity. In order to be a good politician, he should recognize his social position strongly."
NBE04218,I think so. The latest scandals made Japanese people angry. The politicians should have responsible for his work and work hard for the future.
NBE04226,"When I read this article, I was surprised that the chief didn't take responsibility. Indeed I was shocked to the fact that abuse was happened , but to me, the most serious incident is responsibility. I think Cheef should take responsibility."
NBE04261,"When I heard this news, I was very regrettable. newspaper often report politician's corruption . So I wasn't surprised the news . but I was furious with a politician's using our tax for their entertainment. I think politics and a gold problem are a kind of word in fashion. We should also watch a politician severely now."
NBE04259,"I agree to your opinion, too. A politician shouldn't use the political fund privately. I wish for a punish severe on the politician."
NBE04208,"There are many cases that Japanese politicians are criticized because of their way to use money these days. In almost all the cases, the money which is used is our tax. I feel anger especially about this. I personally think there should be something like more strict rules about politicians corruptions."
NBE04207,I completely agree with your idea. It is really a shameful thing that Japanese politicians quit their job because of their scandal.
NBE04264,"I think so, too. I'm interested how womens' status are enhanced by Abe's policy."
NBE04265,"I think so, too. Latest politicians caused politic money problems. They should be responsible for their job."
NBE04195,"I think so too. Not only opposition parties but also we, citizens, have to keep watch on activities of the ruling party. To be specific, we should make an organization composed of people regardless of young and old, men and women."
NBE04221,At first I was so disappointed when I read this article. That is because our money is spend to such sex club. But I think there are many problem like this which is not found in public and the problem like this lead to political apathy among the young.
NBE04222,I agree with your opinion. Recently these problem happen many times. These problem lead to political apathy among the young.
NBE04215,"I strongly agree with your opinion!! Politician must not use political funding for self-interest. Today, many politician quite there job for scandals. Politician should be responsible for there action more."
NBE04232,"I think that Yoichi Miyazawa went a sex club. However the problem is that he used office money for sex club. Including Yoichi Miyazawa , some members of Japanese assembly lack consciousness of being member of it. Much more it is needless to say that a minister should have the consciousness and responsibility."
NBE04204,"When I read this news, I felt so funny because Yoichi Miyazawa was too silly. To use office money for sex club is crazy thing and no one allow to do that. We can think easily that to use office money is not be allowed. So he should reflect that."
NBE04203,I agree with you that we should observe offers' act.
NBE04239,I agree with you too. This scandal is too shameful to be a politician. Japanese politicians must gain a people's confidence.
NBE04231,"I agree with you. I don't know why such a fool person can get political serious position and I was disgusted by how Japanese politic does not work properly. If this situation continues, Japan will be damaged seriously."
NBE04276,"When I read this article, I'm surprised and feel ashamed. It is shameful that Japanese politicians quit their posts due to their scandal. I want politicians to do clean politics."
NBE04194,"I strongly agree with your opinion. As long as they politicians get a lot of money as a salary which is mostly composed of our tax, they have to work hard and must not do improper things which look strange from citizens' viewpoint."
NBE04242,I thought that Ms. Obuchi is not related. She has common sense so she can judge herself. this case happen without her. I think so.
NBE04243,This is because I also think recent politicians have no responsibility and must remember the spirit they started with. This is the very thing I have been considering for long time.
NBE04248,"I was so disappointed with the news. Also I was disgusted at Japanese politicians because the incidents like this often occur these days. I want to remember the politicians to their pride that they felt when they started so important occupation for all the nation. Also, we should not only criticize the politicians but also participate in the politics."
NBE04217,I strongly agree with this opinion because politician should not use the funding money for their own private use. We cannot trust today's politicians of Japan. We must chose some people who can be responsible for their actions.
NBE05835,"I am sure that politicians' funds must be managed carefully. Many politicians receive money from their party for political activities and their party receive money from the government funds. The government funds are composed of national debt and taxes on the nation. Therefore, many politicians receive money from citizens indirectly. In conclusion, politicians' funds are equal to nations' money and it is essential to be managed carefully"
NBE07362,"It is embezzlement to spend the money of the company for the purpose of personal - going to the sexual club. The minister does not accept it, but I think that it is a problem that such an expenditure was done. Minister should take a certain action as one of the people on behalf of a country."
NBE07361,"I think so, too. Tax should be used more useful for people who live in the country."
NBE06634,"When I read this article, I was surprised so much. Politics and money problem are often reported recently. In this situation, It is a very sad thing that a case like this time happened. According to this article, it is said that Miyazawa oneself does not go to the JT007 bar. However, the problem is not whether Miyazawa went to the club but whether the money of politics was spent. By this case, Miyazawa resigned. Nevertheless, Ms. Obuchi resigned by the issue of political fund this time. The politics of Japan always betrays us. I want a politician to be aware that themselves support politics of Japan more."
NBE06386,I THINK THAT Japan minister support staff put sex club on expenses. BECAUSE JAPAN NEED MONEY TO PAY OTHER COUNTRIES. MANY PEOPLE SAY THIS IS RIDICULOUS. BUT WE SHOULD DO NEW THINGS.
NBE04283,"As for this news about South Korean ferry, I know very well because we learned about this in spring semester in this class. Therefore, I was interested in this news when I found the headline. While reading this article, I was becoming angry to remember the detail of the news and how bad the captain's action was. I think the worst of his behavior was he himself could be alive although he didn't try to pay attention to his passengers and save their lives. If I were the protesters' position, I would want him to compensate his fault by death penalty. According this article, I knew the fact that the crew member steering the ship at the time of the accident was relatively new to the job and did not have the skills and experience required. This is very terrible situation and I think this kind of thing was caused by the government. There should be more and more strict rules because this would affect the people's lives, the most precious thing. In the trial in Gwangju, the captain said he was not in a normal state of mind when the incident occurred, however, I think this statement was not appropriate considering his responsibility. I also think the owner of the company and billionaire business Yoo Byung-Eun didn't have the responsibility toward the action, and he shouldn't have disappeared and died. To avoid this kind of thing happening again, all people whose jobs could have influence on lives should reconsider about how to behave."
NBE04290,"Your opinion is very good and I in part agree with it. I think this accident was caused not only by the captain and the government, but also by other crews in the ship and the company executives. The terrible situation is due to both the government's loose regulation and the company's corrupt management system (that is the executive's fault). Prosecutors should not blame only on him. Those involved in the accident are all responsible for it. In addition to reconsidering how to behave responsibly at an individual scale, I want all the companies in the world to check whether their safe systems is valid or not."
NBE04277,"I think the prosecution is too severe. What problem the death penalty solves? Does the prosecution pander to the lowest public opinion? The Korean judiciary should aim for discovery of the truth. Role of the judiciary is not to give the judgment which the nation hopes. If this goes on, South Korean hurt confidence in the justice system. I wish the judgment is given following the law."
NBE04289,"When I heard this news, I thought it is very difficult problem. If I were one of families who lost their sons or daughters, I would be more angry. Thus I can understand people are angry like that. However, it is difficult to judge this accident. Of course the captain had fault but the ship had defective, too. Thus I thought this court in November has long time to judge."
NBE04279,"This article is related to spring class, and I am interested in clue's responsibilities. This terrible accident is brought about by them. I think that although the captain of the ship did not have adequate action to passengers, the ship company which entrust the man who cannot do that as the captain may also be blamed on. As many people wish clues take a lot of punishment in the court, in the future not to repeat cruel accident proper judgements will be desired."
NBE04292,"When I read this article, I grew impatient that the truth of this incident is not clear. I think that a captain of this ferry has hidden the truth yet. If my family has been involved in this incident, I would have gotten angry with the crew. However, this incident has not been clear yet. Therefore, it is very difficult to judge this incident. The trial cannot sentenced the defendant without positive evidence. I think that employees of transportation must not forget to have a responsibility of lives of passengers. I hope that a incident like this do not occur anymore."
NBE04293,"I think it is necessary to ask for South Korean ferry captain, Lee Joon-Seok, to be sentenced to death. This is because he had escaped the ship without any efforts to rescue passengers and claimed the lives of a lot of young people. Moreover it will make incidents like this not occurred that prosecutors seek death penalty for him."
NBE04282,"We read about this news in spring class. So I remember about this problem. I think the captain of ferry, Lee Joon-Seok, is lacking in a sense of responsibility. He should rescue the passengers before he leave the ferry, but he didn't. In addition, he tell a lie. It is very guilty. So, I think it is appropriate sentence."
NBE04294,"As soon as I knew , I came outrage for Lee. Many lives are lost by his survive. I think he should guarantee passengers safety. So he should be sentenced death penalty."
NBE04286,"I think the captain must be received a death sentence too. The captain was not at the helm of the vessel when it capsized, and jumped into a rescue boat before passengers. As a result, about 300 people were killed in the accident. therefore, he killed a lot people. So, I agree with prosecutor."
NBE04284,"I do not think so. This news is simple. Ship accident was all captain's fault. I did not understand why he abandoned many passengers. The care of the passengers is a really important task for captain. He should not be permitted, I think."
NBE04295,The captain of the ship shouldn't be executed. But the he should make maximum compensation. His crime is very big. But the responsibility against which he couldn't take a measure at all at an accident isn't only his. For example the interest of the government which should make a system and the people who should audit. . . Everything lacked is a problem. The length of the ship should be the linchpin to improve future's marine accident as a person who experienced of a cruel and regrettable event. That's the compensation he should take.
NBE04291,The captain did shocking deed. His deed result to kill and pain many people and their family. I think It deserves murder so the captain must be received a death penalty. He did not do anything that must be done in this situation. There is no room for commiserating.
NBE04278,I think you are right. A captain of a ship have a responsibility to make sure the passengers' safety and security. But he betrayed them. The only man who can control the ship was the captain. So e evasion of his responsibility. Therefore it is natural that many Koreans think he deserves death penalty.
NBE04281,"It is very difficult problem whether sentence should be heavy or light. In this case, ferry's captain didn't help passengers, but he escape from ferry first. I think it is very guilty action, because captain should help passengers first. If he had helped people, there would haven't much the dead. So, I think this sentence is appropriate."
NBE04288,Prosecutors seek death penalty for South Korean ferry captain. I think South Korean ferry captain should be death penalty. His crime which killed many people is very serious. His deed was not excused. And the owner of the company Yoo Byung-Eun disappeared after the disaster and was later found dead. His deed was also excused.
NBE04287,I agree with you. I think he deserves murder so the captain must be received a death penalty too. there is no room for him to run away.
NBE04280,"I think Captain Lee made a serious mistake because more than 300 passengers were died in this tragedy. However, we should think carefully about death sentence. All the importance of the life is equal, among the captain and passengers. It is most important that the captain renounce his former sins and never cause such a disastrous accident."
NBE04285,"I agree that the only man who can control the ship was the captain. However, he got rid of a passenger, and the action lead passengers to death. The feeling of bereaved will be unbearable other than the death penalty."
NBE04296,"I think so, too. The captain should atone for his sin to work. Death sentence won't make anything."
NBE04359,"It's so exiting news. I really admire the development of technology. If we can take the flying car, it is the best way to go to school. I feel comfortable. Change of how to transport will change economy globally. But the dream won't come true for a while because there are problems about accident and license and runway. The price will be high. So I'm still anxious about taking the flying car."
NBE04335,"This is a fascinating news and I rejoice to see the technology advances rapidly. Although there are a lot of problems about the vehicles (e. g. cost per one car, law systems, fuel efficiency, capacity of parking areas, and the like), I hope the time will come when they are available to us at a very low price. If they are introduced, I surely buy one, as even now I am already fed up with Japan's heavy traffic!"
NBE04329,"I was surprised as reading the article. Because I couldn't believe flying car close to reality. I think it is possible to realize flying car only in the Harry Potter's world. The car's wings can fold in behind. I like this point . And to realize generalize, the function in order to fit into normal cars is important. It is not only wonderful point about the news but also anxiety. I am worried about safety about flying car. If the car is completion, the rule of using and the way of emergency must show for safety drive. And need people responsible . Because the car ran out of gasoline in the sky mean the car fall into the ground, town , mountain and so on. That may cause a large scale accident. So, before occurring some accident , they should think the way deal with the accident and show it us. I am looking forward to realize riding the car."
NBE04348,"I think that this success of prototype give us dream, but it is long way to make them practical. It i because, in the sky, there are no ways that are maintained. If we drive cars in such places, there would be many accidents. When we bring fling cars into reality, we must think about things like this. However, it is really exciting news for me, because I have watched fling cars in my favorite animation. I seek to the generation which fling cars are seen ordinarily."
NBE04310,"I was really surprised to hear this news. Speaking of flying cars, I imagine the cars in the movie of Harry Potter. Of course, Harry Potter is a movie and a fiction, so I cannot believe that this car is real. The day may come when flying cars are the mainstream of the world. Until now, humankind made the impossible possible by a continuous effort, so I believe and hope we can."
NBE04309,"I want to buy this car too, but I wonder a deliver's license is the same as now. How about signals, air roads, and air lanes? There are many difficulties, so the generalization of flying cars may be years away."
NBE04341,"I was surprised that I read this article very much. A lot of flying cars appeared in my dream, but I cannot yet believe that a car may fly in the sky practically. It is Unbelievable! It is long in coming to look at the real thing."
NBE04306,"From my childhood, I have a dream driving a flying car. This news make many people happy. Many people should have dreamed flying with a car once. I am sure that it is difficult to driving it while we're living. However this progress is so big for us and we have to make efforts tl keep this progress."
NBE04328,"I had a same image for a flying car when I reading the article. As watching the scene, I wanted to ride the car like Harry potter. I also unbelievable the car close to reality. And your comment made me encourage ! I think your comment especially last sentence is so important thinking. Although I tend to forget the thinking , I try many thing I want to do without fear."
NBE04343,"I was surprised when I read this news and I can't believe it. I was excited very much because the thing which I watched by comics in a childhood really came out. The development of the recent technology was great, but I felt they came to here at last. I think that it is good all the more if the death of the traffic accident decrease in this technology. I want you to develop the technique that is helpful for people."
NBE04305,"When I read this article, I was so excited to know how developed the technology was! If this kind of car will be released, I really want to try it because I think this will help those, who are very busy and have to commute for a long time. In my case, I go to Keio University by Shinkansen every day so it took a long time and cost too much. I wish I would sleep longer even when I have a class which begins at 9 by using this car! There are a lot of good points about this but I also think there are bad points at the same time. For example, as the article says, it's not unclear whether it will ever fulfill the ultimate promise of the flying car of science fiction and maybe there will happen a lot of accidents because of not having rules on traffic enough. Moreover, we have to think about if there are no problems considering environment. However, this kind of news made us happy and maybe helped many kids have wonderful dream, so I hope the frying car will be practical someday."
NBE04350,This is very exciting news!! Flying car is like a dream and dream thing when I was young. But in this 21 century's science technology are so great and wonderful. I am looking forward to making practical or useful. My dream will come true maybe. I wish that I can see this car and ride it in the future.
NBE04314,"I felt excited when I read this article. This invention include our dream. Even if this is a little little little step to reality, I think the step is most important. Above all, just once I'd like to ride on the flying car!!! I want them to realize our dreams. If I am allowed to ask for more, the issue that takeoff and landing require a 200-meter grass strip should be solved in the future. Because, after all, I want to fly immediately when I am stuck in traffic."
NBE04318,"I was surprised and excited when I read this article. I remembered that when I watched a flying car in the movie of Harry Potter, I longed to ride such dream like vehicle. I think this flying cars have many problems now. If its problems are solved and it is commonplace for the general public to commute or move, there will be no traffic jam and it will be possible to move quickly. Although I recently obtained a driving license, it will be unnecessary. I am looking forward to riding it."
NBE04346,"It is very interesting news. With this car, it will be able that transport for commuters and middle-distance travelers, especially in countries with underdeveloped road infrastructure. But there are some problem . Operating air plane is very difficult and we need to be trained and license. Air plane accident is very danger. There is runway problem also. I think there are still many problems to solve before the fulfillment of the flying car."
NBE04345,"I think so too. Actually there is some problems on driving the flying car, training how to fly, licenses, runway. . . etc. But anyway, I will be happy such a car become a real thing."
NBE04321,"Flying cars are our dream. In Doraemon's world , cars are flying. A lot of children watch it, so many people have dreamed the world. The advance is wonderful. However, AeroMobil still have many problems. The Road Traffic Law doesn't cover the traffic in the air. Requiring a full airport with a big runway is a big problem. I expect flying cars' spread and I can have the car."
NBE04327,"It is so exciting news. Imaging to drive and fly with one vehicle, it seems to be very fan, and scaring a little. I am looking forward to realization of a dream of flying cars."
NBE04322,I can't yet believe that cars may fly practically too. I want to ride flying cars and Maglev train fast. I have been excited.
NBE04301,"I was surprised to know this news. I had not thought that a flying car would become real. When I was an elementary school student, I watched the movie, ""back to the future"". I love this movie because of a lot of future instrument such as a frying car. However, the problem will occur If a flying car becomes real. For example, new traffic accidents that we have never had will happen. We have to enact new laws on this invention."
NBE04302,I agree with you. This news makes us expect a rose-colored future. I am looking forward to seeing this invention!
NBE04342,"I like these kind of stories. I mean future science. From the last century, it has been said that cars fly. And now the dream is coming true! However, I I think flying cars will result in traffic jams of sky, because there are no rules, traffic lights etc. We need those sky traffic system in the near future."
NBE04311,"I strongly wish this car will be on sale soon for daily use. It is amazing to know things which have been the dreams of men are now realized. I even hope this car won't need a long runway to fly up, so that I can use it anywhere. It amazes me how science today is improving fast."
NBE04354,"I hope flying cars. When I was child, I respect it. So if these cars are made, I am very happy!!"
NBE04358,"I think this invention is so exciting news for human. When I was a schoolchild, I loved Shinichi Hoshi, whose SF involved the flying car. So I was surprised that the SF story had come true. However, I think this invention won't spread easily because of the high cost of flying car . I hope the invention won't be used for weapons like SF."
NBE04357,I agree with you because of having fear that the lack of preparation for this invention. I think we shouldn't be hasty and prepare for practical using this invention in general.
NBE04344,"When I read the article, I remembered a scene of ""Harry Potter"". I remember I was so excited when having seen the scene of a flying car. If this dreams come true, global transportation would change greatly and the border of people would blur. I think it will bring good results in current globalizing world."
NBE04320,"I was surprised when I read this article. when I was child, I wanted to get flying car. Of course it was impossible to get flying car that time, but now I can make it possible my childhood dream to come true. So, I want to drive flying car right now. I hope that day comes soon."
NBE04337,"This is so exciting a news. From the ancient, it is the human dream to fly in the sky freely. This is the case that human chimera may become reality. When I heard that news, from the bottom of my heart, I was astonished by that invention. It's not long before human dreams come true."
NBE04326,I felt exactly same thing with you. It is unbelievable!
NBE04356,"When I heard this news at the first time, I was very excited because I wanted to fly in the sky in my childhood. However, after reading this article, I feel uneasy for many problems of flying car. There are still many problems like accident. I suppose we mustn't only look at dream, we have to resolve those problems."
NBE04352,"This news made me so happy! When I was a second year student in the elementary school, I drew the picture of future car. Its title was ""flying car"". So, I remembered it. At the same time, this news brought back excited feeling of my childhood. I more looked this news up online, I found and watched its promotion video. Many messages were written in the comment column from all over the world. I want to ride in that car soon!!!"
NBE04361,"This news has a dream! It's so exciting! I love the popular American movie ""Back To The Future"" and the flying car ""De Lorean"" (It's a time machine) appear in it. It didn't have wings but it's so cool! When I was a child, I have wanted to drive De Lorean. I'm so excited to know my dream which I had when I was a child will come true possibly. if flying car was very popular in the future, traffic control of sky may be so hard. And I'm anxious about the noise of them. However, I agree to make flying car basically and I'm looking forward to seeing real flying car."
NBE04304,"I agree with you and when I read this article, I was so excited to know how developed the technology was! If this kind of car will be released, I really want to try it because I think this will help those, who are very busy and have to commute for a long time. In my case, I go to Keio University by Shinkansen every day so it took a long time and cost too much. I wish I would sleep longer even when I have a class which begins at 9 by using this car! There are a lot of good points about this but as you commented, I also think there are bad points at the same time. For example, as the article says, it's not unclear whether it will ever fulfill the ultimate promise of the flying car of science fiction and maybe there will happen a lot of accidents because of not having rules on traffic enough. Moreover, we have to think about if there are no problems considering environment. However, this kind of news made us happy and maybe helped many kids have wonderful dream, so I hope the frying car will be practical someday."
NBE04300,"I remember the movie, ""Back to the future 2"" when I read this article. You mentioned the movie, ""Harry Potter"". I was surprised to know other movie in which a flying car is found! I think that the desire to fly is a primitive hope for us."
NBE04312,"In article, it is said that the flying car could become a regular mode of transport for commuters or travelers, especially in countries with underdeveloped road infrastructure. This is very exciting story. But I think it is very sad story that there would be countries whose road infrastructure would not be developed when car could fly."
NBE04297,"I felt the wind of innovation in technology. If the flying car is put to practical use, we can go far with a light heart and solving traffic jams is promising. While, it is essential to make the operation of the car easier and consolidate the systems of air traffic. After all is put into place, I am looking forward to rinding the car."
NBE04298,I think so too. I hope this innovation in technology make people's traveling safer and more comfortable.
NBE04323,I was very excited. I am looking forward it too. I wish that I can see this car and ride it in the future.
NBE04355,"I have read the book of Shinichi Hoshi too , so I really agree with your opinion. I wish this invention won't lead the situation like SF."
NBE04303,"I was very excited to read this article because I like the movie named ""Back To The Future"" in which we can see the car-shaped flying time machine. If this car comes true, I think that we can easily move from one place to the other place far away. However, it may take a long time to be reasonable for us to buy and to be quite safe to ride. I expect Japanese companies develop flying cars earlier than those of the U. S or European countries."
NBE04336,"Anything one man can imagine, other men can make real. It is my favorite proverb by Jules Verne. And flying car is one of the most desired things we can imagine, so I was very excited to read the article. I'm looking forward to making real unbelievable things such flying car more and more in the future."
NBE04319,"I agree with your opinion. It is wonderful that flying cars become real, and I want to ride on it as soon as possible. However, we must enact new traffic laws before we ride on flying cars."
NBE04349,I have same dream with you!! I think so too. I hope engineer resolve these problem quickly!
NBE04339,I was very excited when I heard this news. The flying car is the one of the human's dream. If this car will be practicalized human will accomplish a splendid achievement again. I dream of the day that I can get on flying car.
NBE04299,"I also think that If I could fly freely, it would be convenient to go around the world. If the car will achieving the future, our childhood dream to come true! Many people around the world must have same dream."
NBE04317,"I think so. Flying cars will help us to move, but there are many problems. We should consider and solve them in order that the flying cars will be realized."
NBE04324,"When I heard the news for the first time, I was so excited!! I think almost men have the experience in imagining to ride a flying car. It is no exaggeration that this vehicle is men's dream. As for a flying car, I can't stop remembering Harry Potter and Back To The Future. Imagining such SF situation would come true, I can't wait to come the time."
NBE04325,"When I finished reading this news, I was very fascinated. If a production of such a dreaming car comes true, I want to ride this car. But there are some problem. For example, there are cost and security problems. Gasoline for flying should be needed. Can we find such a lot of gasoline? Security is more important problem. While anxiety of an accident is left, a passenger would be little realistically. We have to settle such problems."
NBE04313,"I agree with you. One of the my dreams is to ride the flying car. It is a difficult way to perform practical use of a flying car, but, judging from development of the present technology, may realize it in the future when it does not have so a long it."
NBE04307,"I completely agree with you. In such case, there are both of good and difficult side. We can't just admire the progress but also consider the problems which are with it. I would like to admire people who have worked hard for it and we should respect them. Always the people who have never given up have changed the world"
NBE04334,What an amazing invention it is! It looks like the world of Osamu Tezuka I think. I wish this invention will make us be more convenient and gentle for the earth.
NBE04353,"I knew the news of the car which flies in the air , now that a linear motor car is making Japan excited. When Japan could develop the car which flies in the air, that would be one step of an innovative technological advance. I imagine such bright Japanese future. If that becomes a reality, I think a request and the courage are given to many Japanese."
NBE04315,"Flying car is so cool!! I was so surprised. I love the movie "" Back to the future "" and have hoped to ride on the Hover board, so I was really got excited. I hope the day that everyone own Frying cars and we can ride them freely on blue sky. This innovation will help people's movement smooth and easy."
NBE04316,"I strongly agree with you!!! If they are on market, I absolutely want to get one, but cost is so big maybe. So I want developer to solve cost problem and also environmental problem of car too."
NBE04338,I agree with you. This news is like a dream. I expect that my dream in childhood come true.
NBE04332,"I am really interested in this news. This is because it is very cool and if we can use flying car, our way of life may change dramatically! However there are some problems, For instance, if a lot of people use the flying car, there will be a lot of traffic accidents. Anyway I wish someday I use a flying car and go where I want to go the way I want to do!!"
NBE04331,"I agree with you. Of course, there are a lot of serious problem about flying cars. However, as roadway's infrastructure was improved, airway's it will be definitively improved. We can expect that we will be able to use flying cars"
NBE04362,"When I read this article, I was very fascinated and I really admire the development of technology. I want to ride flying cars soon!!!!"
NBE04351,"I approve your opinion. Flying is one of the common dream of human. Moreover, if flying car will become practical, the world transportation way will have changes dramatically. I hope people all over the world share the dream."
NBE04360,"I was excited like her to development of the car which flies in the air, too. But at the same time, I hit upon a problem as traffic rule production in the sky. Her opinion was same as me. But she pointed out a problem more accurately than me. This is the reason that I chose her comment."
NBE04330,"The article didn't say about the flying car's safety. I think a consumer want the information about safety. Although that is attractive news, I got the impression that the contents have lofty ideals. The classmate comment is the opposite of my opinion. In my opinion, that is important to human right."
NBE04347,There is exactly what I would like to say in this comment. I often imagine such a car. It feels like a dream if i can use that car. But I tend to be a realist. I also imagine that there are some problem.
NBE04308,I feel the same way. Finally this time came. We can fly with a car. How wonderful it is!!!!!! It is unbelievable.
NBE05024,"HIs feeling is exactly same as me. (surprised, and unbelievable)"
NBE04333,"I think it is so cool and damn too. And I also imagine ""Back to the future""!!! This flying car is condensed everyone's dream that we've had since when we were children."
NBE04363,"I think the resumption of operations at the facility should be stopped and also there is nothing for it but to do. We have to provide energy without big supporting, but if we keep on relying on thermal power generation, it will become resource-tight."
NBE04364,"I can't agree with your opinion. I think that we need nuclear power. In truth, nuclear power may be dangerous, but I believe we can use this power safely. If we can use nuclear power safely, this power provides our society a lot of richness."
NBE04368,"When I read this news, I was surprised very much. I am against a capital punishment. The person that the death penalty is carried out may be surely the person who did murder. Even so, it is easy to murder a murderer. I think that the murderer lives seriously and should compensate for a crime. According to this news, Reyhaneh Jabbari was hanged without enough investigation. Moreover, it is said that such a thing is not uncommon in Iran. I feel sad and anger. I think that Iran should respect the life of the person and promote the abolition of capital punishment."
NBE04367,"This article shows us that even now these cruel judgments have been practices. In Jabarri's judgment, Iranian government consider that the capital punishment was judged and executed fairly based on Iranian laws. Moreover, we can say that Iranian government quietly insist Iranian law and the way to govern Iran is only Iranian business, and that there are no right for other organizations to force Iran to change the judgment laws. It is the reasonable insistence. However, the present Iranian laws are unfair for women. There were lots of countries which had harsh convention of women. Nonetheless many countries have revised more equal lows and rules. Now Iranian government need to face the social and judicial inequality of woman."
NBE04369,"I am surprised that there are many people who are executed all over the world. In this case, although she murdered him, I think she should not repent for her crime with death. He had life without her murder. She should live with his life."
NBE04383,"I was very surprised at this news because I've never heard that a country changes its national flag. I can understand that current New Zealander want to change a flag just because New Zealand is an independent state now and don't need great supports by the UK. However, on the other hand, I suspect that New Zealander dismiss a current flag and accept a new flag without feeling a sense of incongruity."
NBE04451,I am surprised that controversies about whether to change national flag took place. I have never ever seen controversies. I think these controversies are in previous.
NBE04425,"I think it is very deeply impressive that the New Zealand which was once a British colony is going to remove Union Jack from the national flag. And judging from a way of thinking of the post-colonialism, I think that this is a proper trend."
NBE04418,"I read the article with great surprise. It is sad that, they are not proud of their national flag. I noticed that I am happy because I like the national flag of Japan the best in all national flags. ""Hinomaru"" is very simple, and can be drawn easily so I think it is a great design."
NBE04426,"I agree with the change. It is a good trial to change New Zealand's national flag and re-define its identity. And the idea of holding a referendum twice - the first being about the flag designs, and the second being about whether to adopt the chosen flag design - is an ideal way of reaching to a national consensus and making the nation's important decision. I think that the island nation enough takes into account both advocates and opponents of adopting the new flag. Since a basis for making the policy is already complete, all it needs is careful consideration and discussion!"
NBE04448,"I respect Mr. Key for what he did. There are two reasons. First, His idea is the best to distance the country from its British identity and heritage. Its design has been imaged British colony by the Union Flag. I hope that it can increase their spirit of independence to remove it. Second, I think it is democratic process to change the national flag by referendum. He accept and reflect to citizen's opinion. But, they had better argue more, between the government and people. I wish it becomes a satisfactory conclusion for them."
NBE04388,"I don't think that the change of flag means they are not proud of that, but maybe they are trying to strong their own identity of the country by the change. However, I really agree with you in the point that you are really feeling good toward the Japanese flag! I also think Japanese flag is very nice even if it is very simple. If it were to be changed, I would feel very shocked! Anyway, it is true that the national flag is very important for all of us!"
NBE04389,"When I read this article, I was very surprised to know that New Zealand was trying to change their national flag because I didn't know the fact before reading this. As the report says, it is absolutely true that the national flag plays very important role considering their identity. Therefore, I think this is both important and difficult problem. In the case of Australia, it is quite different from that in Canada which changed its national flag and I couldn't imagine that many Australians thought they didn't want to change the flag because they have competed in Olympic Games under the flag and there's a sense of pride in it. Maybe in New Zealand, I think there will be a lot of opinions as well as in Australia, but I think the process of thinking about changing the design to one that better reflects their status as a modern, independent nation is the most important. I think the way of the Prime Minister's thinking, retaining the current flag is a possible outcome of this process and the consideration of options will be done carefully, respectfully and with no presumption in favor of change, is so nice. Anyway, I am very interested in this news so looking forward to the outcome of two referendums."
NBE04457,"When I read this article, I was surprised to know that the national flag of New Zealand will change possibly. When I was a third grade student of junior high school, I have been to New Zealand and lived with local families for two weeks. I enjoyed this homestay program and I came to love New Zealand, so I am very interested in this problem. National flags are not mere flags. They are symbol of nations. Now, the design of New Zealand's flag symbolized ""a colonial and post-colonial era whose time has passed"". Mr Key think that New Zealanders should adopt a design which symbolizes the independent nation ""New Zealand"". I agree with his opinion. However, I think that New Zealanders should consider whether they change their flag or not cautiously."
NBE04397,"I think that it is very good to change the design of the national flag. New Zealand has been colonized by England for years, and the Union Jack was drawn also on the national flag. However, it is possible to make a flag that incorporates their own culture of New Zealand, New Zealand will be able to show the world that the country is a full-fledged independent country. In addition, national flag is an important symbol that gives characterize image the country to the people, so many people will be able to catch a glimpse of the traditional culture of the country."
NBE04396,I agree with your comment. I'm sure that New Zealand really would like to express that the country has been independent from England by removing Union Jack which are in the national flag. I hope that it comes true that the new national flag is decided on.
NBE04444,"I was so surprised by the fact that Canada has changed their national flag. Besides, in New Zealand, there is a move for changing their national flag. If the flag will be changed, we will be confused but realize that New Zealanders have something to claim to the world. I think this way of assertion is very effective. However, if an argument like this will occur in Japan, I disagree to the opinion that the national flag should be changed. I love Japanese national flag."
NBE04456,"I think so. it is a too difficult problem. New Zealanders shouldn't decide hurry. If Mr Key stuck to his opinion and change the national flag, New Zealand can show the pride of independent state. However, the relationship between New Zealand and UK may be fragile."
NBE04370,"When I read this article, I was a little perturbed. Mr. Key insists that changing the national flag is necessary for ""independent nation"". What national flags stand for? I think they stand for integration. Therefore, nobody must force anybody to respect a national flag. It is because that causes the division of the nation. Moreover, it causes deadly uplift of the nationalism. So I hope New Zealanders unify after having changed their national flag. And I want to coexist respecting each national flag. New Zealanders should closely examine all aspects of changing national flag."
NBE04438,"When I read this article, I was surprised that New Zealand will try to change the national flag. I think that the national flag carry a tradition and a history of the country. Therefore, It is not easy to change the national flag and the national anthem. I think it is important for New Zealanders to think what is their symbol. I agree with changing the national flag. It is because that New Zealand became an independent nation. It is already an colonial. I think New Zealanders should adopt its design which symbolizes an independent nation. In Japan, we know that Japanese anthem carries a tradition inherited and a painful past of a war. Therefore, we should keep it. If a topic that whether Japan change the flag and the anthem or not, we should discuss carefully."
NBE04380,"I don't attach importance to a national flag. Changing a national flag is a matter of no importance. It is true that we feel national unity when we see our national flag. However, I think that it is an expedient to symbolize a nation. Some people says that the national flag of Japan reminds us of militarism. However, the national flag of Japan is a mark and an insignia. When they criticize a national flag, they seem to want to forget what to do in order to prevent militarism. We have to discuss what is most important."
NBE04450,"I was surprised when I read this news. This is because I have not thought that a national flag changes so far. According to this news, an opinion to change a national flag seems to have a pro and con. If Japanese Government says that we may change a national flag, I strongly object. Like this news, I think that we should not change a national flag even if a Japanese national flag did not express the Japanese history. This is because the national flag is the thing which symbolized Japan for a long time. I think that we should deepen the opinion about the national flag ."
NBE04434,"I was surprised that I read this article very much. This is because it has not heard that it changes the national flag. However, I think that it is good to forget a past, and to advance. If a national flag changes; historic for the world and historic not to mention it for Australia countries. When the design imitates Japan, I think that it is interesting."
NBE04420,"When I read this article, I agree that New Zealand would change its national flag. Of course, some people disagree. The reason is that there were a lot of people who have fought for the national flag. However, the design of New Zealand's flag symbolized ""a colonial and post-colonial era whose time has passed. "" New Zealand should have its own flag . For example, Canada changed its national flag in the past. Thus the flag should be changed."
NBE04419,"I agree with you. It is because changing national flag is a good way to forget a past and to advance. It is important for New Zealand for the future. In addition to, it is good historically, too."
NBE04401,"When I read this article, I was surprised and then felt good. National flag shows nation's feature. I think it is strange that New Zealand's flag includes Union flag. So I think New Zealand changing flag is good thing."
NBE04400,I have same opinion. Nations have there own features and it is not needed that New Zealand's flag includes Union flag. I agree with the idea that New Zealand change the national flag.
NBE04427,"I completely agree with you. Although, as you say, there are pros and cons about changing the national flag, this selection seems to be done in deep consideration, which I value as a very ideal way of making national decision. So, I am looking forward to the result of the two referendums, too."
NBE04422,"I was surprised at Australian's opinion about whether national flag is changed or not. I have no idea like Australian's. I thought it is better for people to change the flag in order to make a new history for colonial country before. After I read the article, my thinking is change. National flag show that the country exist. There are many representation about Japan such as sushi , sumo. But I think National flag is most clearest representation about Japan. Although how many times are passed, people have a national flag as a common representation about Japan. And every countries have a flag, so it is easy to compare among countries. Sushi and sumo can be arranged by foreign , but National flag show the country's history and can't be arranged easily. So National flag is so important for country's identity. I thought just about National flag at first, but that is so deep meaning and that has people's feeling and proud."
NBE04421,"I agree your opinion about changing the flag is effective way of assertion for around world. In addition, I think movement of changing the flag is enough to assertion for around the worlds. Leaving the British flag is more better to impression to England and coming generation ."
NBE04454,I think New Zealand doesn't need to change national flag because the people recognize the flag as their own national flag for a long time. Though it's strange the UK's national flag is included even the mark is part of the national flag. And changing flag isn't easy. Many procedures will need. So I think the flag should be kept.
NBE04372,"I was so surprised to hear the news. I didn't know that Canada has changed their national flag and New Zealand try to change their flag. New Zealand is now not a colony but an independent nation. So Mr. Key try to change the national flag to erase the image of a colony. I think it is good idea. Whereas, national flag carry a variety of things, glorious and disgraceful history of the country, thought, culture, and heritage. Therefore I think they need more depthful council."
NBE04437,"I think so. I also think a national flag represents the nation so much. In Japan, There are a lot of tradition and history of Japanese in our nation flag. Therefore, it is not so easy to change a national flag."
NBE04411,"When I read this article, I was surprised at two things. The first thing I was surprised at is the fact that Canada has changed their national flag . I did not know this fact. The second thing I was surprised at is that New Zealand try to change the design of their national flag. Changing national flag may be help to forget a dark past. However, I think New Zealand must not change the design of their national flag, because the design was loved by a lot of New Zealanders for a long time."
NBE04436,National flag is one of a symbol of the country. Therefore each people should be proud of their flags and the flag should be organized with elements of the country. New Zealand is a member of the U. K. It is natural that Union Jack is in the national flag. However New Zealand is an independent country. I can understand some of them would change the flag. Anyhow foreigners must not jump in this issue.
NBE04393,"A national flag is a symbol of their people. We can bind together because of it, so it plays a really important role. I think national anthem has the same implication. However, in Japan, there are some people dealing with the national anthem neglectfully. It is very shameful because national anthem express own identity and I do not understand why they treat them irresponsibility. We should be proud of national symbol."
NBE04443,"After read the article, I thought they are not proud of their national flag. But I can understand that current New Zealand want to change a flag just because New Zealand is independent of United Kingdom and don't need supports by the United Kingdom. However I think New Zealand should decide more carefully. Because the relationship between New Zealand and UK may be worse."
NBE04371,I think whether the design is loved by a lot of New Zealanders is not known until the referendum. It will be decided the weight of unlearning dark past or preserving tradition and history.
NBE04447,"I was surprised this news because I had not know it at all until I first read the article. I learned that each country's flag shows the country's history, culture, and identity. Also, when the consideration of the nation is changed, the new national flag take over present national flag. This is as a matter of course. But I have forgotten it, because national flag was permanent and no substitute existence for me. I am not Australian. So, I have no right to decide weather Australia should change its national flag. But I will approve the decision about conclusion of Australia's national flag."
NBE04414,"I was very surprised at this news. Nations flag is important. So I understand their action. But I have not heard the change of the flag. Though I have a little of uncomfortable feelings, their intention should be respected."
NBE04429,"I think it is necessary for New Zealanders to change their national flag. Because it is bad thing for both New Zealanders and british people. When we imagine our nations, we draw our flags to head at first. So flags are very important symbols for nations. And If there are New Zealanders who think it uncomfortable that national flag contains Union Flag, british people also must want to change it. So I think it is necessary for New Zealanders to change their national flag."
NBE04387,"It is very strange story that country change its national flag. Before I read this article I can't understand why people in New Zealand want to change it. However, there is background that country was colonial. In consideration of this, I think New Zealand may change its flag, because it may bring new image of New Zealand and also can be wiped away the past. On the other hand, if country choose to change the flag, it may break its traditional image and fade that it was colonial country in past. So, people in New Zealand should considerate carefully."
NBE04431,"I think it ideal for New Zealanders to remake their national banner. In terms of arousal of nationalism, it bring about a lot of boon. Looking back, Canada also changed their flag to distance the country from its British identity and heritage. And now, of course she has some internal troubles, but compared with the past it eminently shows its independent from UK. Thus I think Australia should follow suit this practice."
NBE04455,"A New Zealand national flag should be changed. There are two reason. First, a national flag is similar to an Australian national flag. A national flag is a national symbol, so it's a problem to make a mistake. Next, the former national flag have meaning with the regrettable and cruel at the war age. The people who wish the New Zealand future would be encouraged for making the national flag new. If this change is decided by a strict voting, the national flag should be changed."
NBE04432,"I agree with your opinion. Considering its people and historical matters, referendum held many times is the amicable arrangement in changing the banner . As you remark in your comments, I too think all they should do is careful consideration and prudent discussion"
NBE04430,"I agree with your opinion. Considering its people and historical matters, referendum held many times is the amicable arrangement in changing the banner . As you remark in your comments, I too think all they should do is careful consideration and prudent discussion."
NBE04376,"I thought this article was very interesting. National flag is a symbol of the country. Many countries has historical reasons in their flag. In this article, changing flag referendum will show people's mind to the country. I am looking forward to the consequences."
NBE04403,I was surprised at this news because I've never known that the country changes its national flag. I can understand that people in New Zealand are willing to change the flag because New Zealand is an independent state and don't need great supports by the UK. I hope New Zealand go well.
NBE04409,"I was surprised that New Zealand will try to change its national flag because I didn't know that the national flag can be changed and Canada had changed its flag. I think the national flag should appeal its identity, so I think it is very important for New Zealanders to consider changing its flag. Then, they must know its history and what New Zealand is. Take account of the colonial era by UK, I agree with changing flag."
NBE04402,I agree with you. this is the good chance which New zealand appeal the world that they are independent state.
NBE04446,"When I read this article, I was surprised because it is big big decision to change the national flag. If they change the national flag, it will influence to over the world. I wonder New Zealand should make a decision carefully."
NBE04433,"I think New Zealand people better take their own way. Now New Zealand is not a colony of US, I think they don't need to continue to put up their national flag . But also I think they don't need change their one. So, this problem depends on the way that New Zealand people think about their national flag."
NBE04405,"When I found the title of the article, I felt so interested in this news. I think referendum on whether to change the national flag is good. History in all countries is changing every second. I think that changing the national flag is good way to show the mind of a nation."
NBE04373,I do not think this is not good news. Because NZ has a long history with Britain. People of England immigrated to the island which is now NZ. This is the origin of NZ. So I think people of NZ should respect today's flag. Because there is here is Union Flag which shows closed connection between NZ and England. I think nations and their flags should represent their history and custom. Therefore New Zealanders should be proud of their history with Great Britain and the flag.
NBE04428,I agree with you. I also think that the national flag carries a tradition and a history of the country. And it is also a symbol of a nation to show a current nation at the same time. And New Zealand is now an independent nation. So I agree with changing the national flag.
NBE04408,"I agree with you. I think the national flag should be symbolized its identity, so it is good to change the flag in New Zealand because existing flag is influenced by the UK."
NBE04416,"When I heard the news, I was surprised because I didn't know New Zealand want to change their national flag. I've never heard such a news, so maybe there are few previous examples so far. So, I think this decision needs great courage. Generally, national flag represents the nation's history and tradition, identity. Moreover, if the national flag is changed, the international community may become confused because the flag is known broadly as the symbol of the nation. Just because a nation want to change their national flag because the flag reminds people of the colonial days, it doesn't follow that the nation can change it."
NBE04415,"I think so. The national flag is the symbol of the nation. many people in the world recognize nations by seeing the flags. If the national flag is changed, a lot of citizens would not regard New Zealand exactly."
NBE04449,I'm confident in a Japanese flag. Central red Maru thinks Japan shows itself. Japan changed a national flag after the World War 2 . I think it's when it's the national reformation to change a national flag. I think Japanese should watch New Zealand decision quietly.
NBE04386,"I think so too. There are backgrounds in New Zealand that country was colonized. So I think New Zealand can change its national flag. However, national flag is symbol of its country, so the New Zealand people should discuss carefully whether change there national flag or not."
NBE04399,"National flag is an identity of the people of each country, so changing it is a really big matter. I want New Zealand to think deeply and create a cool flag that directly shows their nationality."
NBE04398,I completely agree with your idea. New Zealand doesn't have to change its own national flag that they have been using for long time.
NBE04379,"I think it is natural demand to change New Zealand's flag, because it is not a colony of UK any longer. However, like Australia, there is another opinion that many Australians have fought and died under that flag sadly, and they have pride in it. The flag represents the country strongly, so nationalities should think about it carefully."
NBE04384,"Anyway, I also think this kind of matter will have great influence on our lives so we all have to consider this problem."
NBE04381,"I agree with you. National flag symbolizes the nation's feature, so it's quite natural for current New Zealand to change it's flag."
NBE04412,At first I was surprised that New Zealand try to change national flag. That is because I didn't know that national flag can be changed. This is very serious problem because national flag is main identity for its country. I think Japanese flag should not change.
NBE04413,I agree with you. This is very serious chance for New zealand's independent history. New Zealand will be able to show the world that the country is a full-fledged independent country.
NBE04417,"I have heard this news story before. So, when I finished reading this article, I wasn't surprised at this incident. I think that this problem is very difficult. In my opinion, to change the national flag doesn't mean complete independence. Because the most important thing for the complete independence is national's awareness. It makes no sense by a superficial change."
NBE04424,"A national flag is seriously important for a country. This is because a national flag is one of identities for a country. Regarding this news , I agree with New Zealand minister. However I want him to ponder which design of the flag is the best in that appropriateness. By the way , I was very surprised to hear news because I have not think such a thing. But if Japan was colonized by other country and the country's marl embedded Japanese national flag, I would want to change the flag."
NBE04423,"A national flag is seriously important for a country. This is because a national flag is one of identities for a country. Regarding this news , I agree with New Zealand minister. However I want him to ponder which design of the flag is the best in that appropriateness. By the way , I was very surprised to hear news because I have not think such a thing. But if Japan was colonized by other country and the country's marl embedded Japanese national flag, I would want to change the flag."
NBE04392,"People have each own feelings about their national flags. Some have feelings of proud and honor. However, other don't so. In my opinion, it is natural that there is difference in feelings about national flags. I can understand what the minister want to say. He want to create ""original New Zealand national flag"" by themselves. I think he wants to establish national identity by doing so. I think his thinking is good and to be respected. However, he shouldn't forget that many people have sweated , fought and been dead under the flag."
NBE04391,"National flags show the nations' identity. So , when a nation changes the national flag, the nation also changes their identity. People should be careful when it happens, and other country shouldn't touch it"
NBE04395,"When I heard this news, I was surprised because national flag changing is rare recently. Yet, I think it is better that New Zealand change their national flag because they are not the UK's colony now."
NBE04394,I agree with you that it is good chance to change national flag of New Zealand. They are not colonized by England now.
NBE04407,"I was surprised at this news because changing the nation flag is big incident. National flag express their country, so I think changing flag means changing country. New Zealand is going to remove the union jack from their flag and i think that it is natural trend."
NBE04406,"I think so too. I do not want to change Japan's national flag. I also think the national flag is explaining our thought, history and our humanity. So I think that we do not need to change our flag and I think same thing as you."
NBE04435,I think New Zealanders are proud of their flags but some of them are not pleased with the national flag with Union Jack. They love their flags and have various understandings.
NBE04458,I am surprised that there are controversies about whether to change national flag took place. This problem depends on the way that New Zealand people think about their national flag. I want to watch New Zealand decision quietly.
NBE04440,I was also surprised at those two informations. However I do not agree your opinion that New Zealand must not change the national flag. This is because we do not know whether New Zealanders love the flag or not and it isn't probably good for them to include the Union flag in the national flag.
NBE04390,"I have a little different idea about this comment because it is said that the writer disagree about the independence. It is true that there will happen a lot of changes if some countries become independent, however, I also sympathize with those in such countries. This is very difficult problem because it is related to our history, and our society all over the world. Therefore, it is needed for us to try to find ways to make as many people's lives as possible better."
NBE04382,"I disagree with your opinion. Changing a national flag is a big problem for the country because a national flag strongly symbolizes a nation. Even though its flag contains a part of the national flag of UK, to have own original flag is very important for an independent country, I think."
NBE04385,"I think a national flag is very important because it is a symbol of its nation. However, he says changing national flag is not so important because the national flag of New Zealand has already contained a part of the flag of UK. I don't think it is persuasive reason because I think national flag should have strong originality."
NBE04445,"I think New Zealand change their national flag is good to show that they are the independent country to the world. However, it is also true that the act would worsen the relationship between New Zealand and the UK."
NBE04453,"Though the relationship between NZ and UK, I think they should change the their flag if they want to get back their honor of independent. Thus, i disagree with her opinion."
NBE04404,I think This is very serious chance for New zealand's independent history. New Zealand will be able to show the world that the country is a full-fledged independent country.
NBE04441,"This is because I think it is not good to forget a past. New Zealand want to change the national flag to hide the past like Australia, indeed, but they have to remember what was happened long time ago in order not to make the same thing."
NBE04452,I think New Zealand shouldn't change national flag . Changing national flag may worsen the relationship and cause any troubles.
NBE04442,"I agree with the changing the flag's design to one that better to reflect the country's status as a modern, independent nation. If changing the flag's design made the union of the nation, it is so nice. It is natural that as the history passes longer, the situation or status of the nation changes. So, I agree with the changing national flag based on persuasive reason. I wonder if that Japan's flag will change in the future. . . . ."
NBE04410,I think the writer didn't read this article carefully because New Zealand has a bad period which was controlled as colony by UK. Its national flag is influenced by that historical fact. So people who live in New Zealand want to change its flag because of showing its identity.
NBE04374,"I think so, too. People in New Zealand should take a long time and consider not just the design of the national flag but also their past and future seriously."
NBE04375,He/She does not understand the complicated relationship between England and New Zealand. NZ is one of the members of the Commonwealth even now. Moreover the head of New Zealand is the queen of Great Britain. The relationship is stronger than we think.
NBE04377,"The comments is easy to understand. Though I agree with vote on changing flag in New Zealand, this comments says clearly what is nice to chose. I could not explain like this!"
NBE04378,I agree with your opinion that it is a too difficult problem to change flags. There are big conflict between the pride of independent and the international relationship.
NBE07330,"I was surprised with the fact that two referendums are hold to decide a flag design, and was impressed with the way how people are thinking carefully about its national pride. This is a good chance for me to reconsider of my own identity. Japan is an island country which has never experienced being colonized and which has decided to not to have a war again. The Japanese flag is always there and nobody doubts it will change. However, it does not mean we do not have to know the meaning of our national flag design, Japanese history, politics, and economics and so on. I think Japanese are too unconcerned for our mother country. By reading and knowing what is happening and how people are struggling with its history even now, I could recognize myself not doing anything to know Japan and I appreciate for this opportunity."
NBE07431,"I was surprised at the news of changing the national flag. At first, I thought there was no need of doing it, but I realized that the national flag meant their identity and so on. Considering it, I thought New Zealanders should make their unique flag. Even if they can not change it this time, this argument will be the good chance of recognizing their uniqueness."
NBE05766,"The tough point of this news is that whether we put emphasis on either history or national feelings. In my opinion, they shouldn't change their flag because history is a pile of various things. They should accept their past which they are ruled by UK and embrace both good and bad aspects. And also, we shouldn't see one side. Having a wide view is important."
NBE05559,"I am surprised to hear this news because I have never heard that national flag can change. If I were New Zealand people, I wouldn't change national flag. I imagine they love their flag which they watched when they were child."
NBE06058,"I agree with the election. If there are some opinions, it is necessary to ask the public opinion. Because problems concerning patriotism or nationalism like this are really important for the people lives in the country. When it is decided the changing, I hope New Zealanders are pleasant with the new design and proud of the new flag."
NBE07363,I agree with your opinion. Asking the public opinion is very important if we make a big decision such as this case.
NBE07364,"This problem will take along time to solve, but I think New Zealanders shouldn't be hurry. Country flag is a symbol of the country and changing it is so big problem that they should think carefully and discuss deeply."
NBE06635,I agree with your opinion. Showing own identity is important.
NBE05300,It is my first time for hearing nation changes its national flag. I am very surprised. I think it is natural to eliminate the other nation's symbol or image from own national flag when the country independent. I understand New Zealand people want to change the flag.
NBE05299,I also think changing national flag is big problem. New Zealanders should think about their flag deeply and decide. It might take long time but this is great important for New Zealanders and the image of them from other countries.
NBE05328,I tend to agree with your opinion. Because this issue is very difficult problem. There are big conflict between the pride of independent and the international relationship. And I don't want to change the flag of Japan.
NBE07499,"Changing the national flag is a big deal since the national flag is a part of its county like its people. I thought it is better to keep their current national flag at first, because people all over the world can recognize that is New Zealand's flag. However, I can understand what Mr. Key thinks. New Zealand's national flag has a flag of the UK and it shows that New Zealand was a former British colony. So he wants to show that his county is already independent and no longer needed their supports. And I think if NZ could change its national flag, it could show its power and protect their prides. So I became to think that it is okay to change its national flag."
NBE06961,"I think New Zealand had better to change the flag because the flag doesn't contain their native inhabitant's symbol, and it lacks originality. I want New Zealand to make a decision quickly."
NBE07050,"I agree with Mr. Key's opinion. I also think that it is important to express independence because the national flag symbolizes the image of the nation. Furthermore, through changing the flag, the nation will unite more strongly. So I'd like New Zealanders to agree with it."
NBE06417,I think this problem is not easy and there are many problems. One of the problems is the relationship between the UK. These problem are not unified problems but pluralistic problems
NBE05732,"I thought why so many countries' flags are designed like the U. K. Now, I understand the reason. And I think they should have new flag. Flag is statue and identity of each country. So, they should remove symbol of colony."
NBE06599,"I was surprised at this news, but I know the country which change the national flag. For example, Kingdom of Lesotho changed it in 2006. The national flag express the nationalism, so changing it equal changing the nationalism. I want to be careful."
NBE06324,First I was surprised to read this news. Because they can change the flag. I think that flag is a state's symbol emblem. So government should respect the people's will. Everyone can understand the result.
NBE06780,"When I read this news , I was surprised and had an idea. I think that New Zealand should remove the Union Flag from their flag because the Union Flag looks like the former British colonies ' proof ."
NBE06355,"I think the flag expresses the history of each country, therefore the changing the flag has the important meaning for New Zealand. So, people in New Zealand have to consider its meaning of their symbol."
NBE05032,"I think to change the national flag has more demerits than merits. If the national flag change, it takes really long time to recognize that is the New Zealand's, and young people cannot feel the its history or background from the flag. These are the reason why I think this way."
NBE06846,I am surprised at this news because I never heard the country change its national flag but I think it is nature movement. It passed long time since New Zealand became independent and enough time to develop New Zealander's own identity. I want to be going to pay attention other the British Commonwealth countries movement. I have interest it.
NBE05142,"I agree with your opinion. I think almost people of New Zealand want to have their nationality. But now, the New Zealand flag include the Union flag. Therefore it does not seem to express a truly independent nation. So I have an idea same as you which people should decide to change their national flag."
NBE06442,"I agree to national flag change plan of the key prime minister. The reason is because proof to be an independent nation and the characteristic of the native are not included in a current New Zealand national flag. However, it will be a problem how you raise the popularity of the national flag after having changed it because the New Zealand is recognized to people of the world widely by a current national flag."
NBE06443,"Surely historic significance and background should be put to a national flag. However, it is not necessary to express the history that a New Zealander was ruled by the U. K. to the national flag which is a national symbol in the present age. I think that I should express a characteristic and the pride of the New Zealand native to a national flag than such a history."
NBE05678,"Actually, I'm very interested in this issue because I experienced short-term overseas study in New Zealand when I was high school student. Indeed, it is difficult to change the flag because it is used as a symbol of New Zealand for a long time, so some people have attachment to this flag. But I think it is great idea using a silver fern on the flag, because the silver fern is a symbol of All Blacks that is very popular rugby team in New Zealand. I'm so looking forward to the result of this discussion."
NBE07182,"In the case of New Zealand, I think they shouldn't change the design of the national flag. The nation was once one of the British colonies until 20 century, and if the flag shows its history, they should keep it with them since it makes sense a lot to them."
NBE06143,"I knew that in New Zealand a problem in that whether or not to turn the national flag is happening for the first time to read the news. Since changing the national flag gives a great influence both within and outside New Zealand, I think New Zealand people should be judged its problem after they thought it deeply."
NBE06142,"I am opposed to your opinion. Why New Zealand's young people have to learn to New Zealand's history and historical background from the New Zealand flag? I think they can learn them with something other than the national flag, such as class at school and books about New Zealand. Since the flag's a thing to represent the country, I think it is better that it changes to fit the situation of the country."
NBE06779,I agree with your opinion. I think the New Zealand should show that it is an independent country all over the world taking advantage of this opportunity.
NBE06280,"I agree with your idea. National Flag represents The country's background, so New Zealand's people have to think about it carefully. Japan once changed flag design. It is because former one shows the wrong symbol of Japan."
NBE05425,"I think that Australian flag should not change. Australian people might be angry, but it is true that today flag spreads all over the world, and the world doesn't concern it so much. I think that if they changed, we would be confused."
NBE05495,"I've never experienced ""colonies"". So, I don't have any idea whether New Zealand should change their flag in order to show their independent from UK or not. But I should think of them in their position. . ."
NBE06356,"If most of New Zealanders would like to change the design of the flag, it should be changed. However, some of them think do not forget the history that people fought and died under that flag during the war. When I consider that, I thought people in New Zealand have to talk more about this problem."
NBE04474,"I don't know many awkward handshakes did between many countries. I think what xi's face wasn't smile though Abe was smiling at first means xi feared Chinese people's reaction if he was doing congress with smile. He had no choice in order to save Chinese people's support for him. I think it is good to meet them . Abe wants to improve relations with Beijing , so his face was smile as he meet xi. Although xi's expression was not good, to be able to hold the congress means xi will think that making better relation with Japan. I think xi's face means two things. One is taking hostile action against Japan for save people's support for him. Another is an expression that he doesn't know what he should do between anti Japanese and thinking of improvement of relation to Japan ."
NBE04478,"The uncomfortable handshakes by world leaders cannot be helped though they are formally. However, frequent handshakes shouldn't be done because the act may cause bad feelings among the people who have dissatisfaction about policy. And it may become a serious situation. So they need consider whether the negotiation went smoothly when handshaking."
NBE04467,"Awkward handshakes have a deep meaning and an important background. Through world history there were many conflicts between countries. In order that these problems were solved, each top leader discussed, but they never permitted each other I think. They paid attention to the whole world and they laughed shaking hands. I hope the day will come when I can see them shaking hands and laughing together from the bottom of their hearts."
NBE04459,"The uncomfortable handshakes can't be helped. Conflicting interpretation of history can be solved easily. This time, Held Japan-China summit have plenty of meaning for two countries. Until that point China criticized Japan within the country, finally the summit substantialized. On China's part, he, they can't choose but tout for Chinese subject that Abe administration changed toward the bright side for consistency's sake of their assertion. That will be likely to make them weaken criticism toward Japanese government. It could be nearing reality to shake hands comfortably with smile."
NBE04471,"Awkward handshakes is often done between leaders of not only nation but also corporation. These actions are necessary. Many people usually say flattery. Being honest is not always good. However, we want to avoid them as much as possible."
NBE04475,"Handshake, whether it is awkward or not, may the useful way to establish friendly relationship. I once heard that in terms of psychology, man who cater to shake hand has a expectation to the person he is speaking to. In this case, that is president Abe and Xi's shaking hand, this theory doesn't hold good. But in someday, I hope the two countries truly help each others and handshake as a sign of trust."
NBE04476,Handshake is indispensable for establishing friendly relationship. Handshake show good relationship between two people or organization. It is good culture and carries out important tasks in the place that people make good relationship in. This culture will continue to the future.
NBE04460,"I think so, too. With conflicts two groups or countries cannot go ahead and make better future. Shaking hands means that people of both sides want to mend the relation. After shaking hands, they can proceed to the future. But two leaders just pretend to be friendly, like Neville Chamberlain and Hitler, there is no future. In fact they cannot have stopped WW2. People should seek peace and friendship with other countries and groups so that leaders can shake hands without any secret intentions."
NBE04462,"I would like to mention ""The uncomfortable handshake between Japan's Shinzo Abe and China's Xi Jinping"" in this article. I am very interested in the relationships between Japan and China. I take a Japan-China relations class. Teacher took up this problem. This meeting got a big write-up in the newspapers. Neighboring countries often disagree with each other. However, we have to search for the ways to make friends with China."
NBE04461,"I agree with you. Handshake is great culture and can be a bridge of friendship between enemies. We have to do our best in order to deepen friendly relations. Handshake is often a courtesy and counterfeit. However, shake hand symbolizes our efforts to make friends with other countries and someone. It is very important action."
NBE04469,"Handshake is a form to establish friendly relationship. If handshakes between countries are awkward, this action is very important each other. Now, the relation between Japan and China is bad, however, Japanese prime minister Abe and China's president Xi shook hands the other day. I think this action will be a key to improve the nation relationship in such two countries."
NBE04472,"Awkward handshake between national counterparts seems to be the diplomatic fault, but I think this awkwardness has a great meaning. For example, Japan and China are the very influenced nations, so many nations that have deep relationship with Japan and China pay attention to the meeting between Shinzo Abe and Xi Jinping. Given the assumption, the two power have to take such nations into consideration. Moreover, Japan and China have a lot of diplomatic problem between them. So, in order to represent the nation's decision that we don't want to yield to counterpart, the awkward handshake is needed."
NBE04463,"Before I read this article, I didn't know there are such a lot of awkward handshake in the world. In this article I only know about Japan and China's relationship isn't so good. The background of Japan and China's awkward relationship is that Japan colonized China in past. And other awkward relationships' background are related to things happened in past. It is sure that people in those country turn against. Also it is impractical that all countries are going to make peaceful relationship. However, I think we should try to make good relation."
NBE04464,"I hope so too. Japan and China are leader of Asia, so if they help each other, not only Asia but also all over the world would develop."
NBE04470,why we are not able to be good relations. I could have not understand such awkward handshake. so I was surprised to read this article. Certainly there is awkward handshake between us. But we are not able to stop such handshake. All we can do is only to see it. Such culture like this will continue.
NBE04465,"In Japan , there is very interesting word ""@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@"" It means ""eye talks a lot of thing just as we talk."" In this case, we can say ""@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@"" I think we can communicate many things by body language than by talking."
NBE04466,"When we want to show friendship, we naturally try to handshake. It is because it is the easiest way. However, we sometimes do it absentmindedly. I think it is not good. I think we should let handshake have meaning."
NBE04468,I was shocked at this story because various countries have awkward relationships between other countries. I want everyone to handshake with smile from their heart.
NBE04477,"I agree with your opinion. Thought, Japan has got along badly with China, there is a strong relationship between them. And, this awkward handshake reflects each countries diplomatic policy. I have not thought about formal handshake seriously, so I was surprised at this article. I learned that Every handshake has every deep meaning."
NBE04481,"I have a doubt that it is thinking too seriously. Of course , their relationship influence various things. But uncomfortable handshakes is so formal. I think uncomfortable handshakes are necessary."
NBE04473,"Thank you for your agreement. As for me, sometimes I also do such an awkward handshake in the case that I have to get along with someone I hate in my heart. In order not to get worse the relationship than now, we have to suppress our hatred. These awkward handshakes in the article shows what nations thought and what they want to express from their attitudes. I think this is the one of the fun of diplomacy."
NBE04483,"When I read this article, I think New Zealand don't have to change its flag. New Zealand's flag include the UK's national flag, however, I hadn't noticed about that until I read this sentence. So It's not a big problem for me. Moreover if its flag is changed to a new flag, the history they made cannot be changed. Therefore , in my opinion, there is no sense in changing the flag."
NBE04480,"I think it is a controversial case. It is natural that man wants a credit from society when he did something he deserve it. However, there is a case that he have to abide it because of his occupation or something like that. Robert O'Neal is a retired US navy seal. I personally think that he should have kept it a secret even if he had already retired his job as a US navy seal."
NBE04484,"I think that changing national flag may worsen the relationship between UK. And I suppose everyone have to think about the role of national flag , too."
NBE04479,I am really surprised that the United States did not keep their secret about Osama Bin Laden property. US's information is highly protected. The tension between US and Islamic world is delicate. So they should rethink their way of protecting secret information.
NBE04492,"When I found this article, I was interested in this news because at University, I learned Germany and I will visit the country next year. Before reading this article, I knew that there were events to mark the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. The picture with a lot of balloons made me relieved and feel good and I became more and more interested in the Berlin Wall. As this article mentioned, nowadays, the wall became more likely to be a part of the city and only about three kilometers from 155 kilometers! I have learned about the World War Two and the role of the wall at high school and it was so terrible for people not to move between East and West side. I can imagine that there were many problems, such as shopping to buy food, traveling, working, and so on, and I think that even influenced to each family relationship! I didn't care that 25 years have already passed since the wall was collapsed before knowing this news but I found such events very good because that would help us to remember what happened in the past. On the other hand, I feel sad to think about the problem, ""a new cold war"". I believe that the war cannot bring happiness for people so I hope that such big problem wouldn't become bigger."
NBE04521,"We can understand how meaningful for peace the break of Berlin's wall was. As I was born after breaking Berlin's wall and the cold war finished, I can't know how grateful the peace is. However, the young generation like me should feel the importance of peace through this event and solve the problem of new cold war as new generation."
NBE04520,I agree with you because I don't want the new cold war spread to spread bigger. We must try to prevent our next generation from the war.
NBE04513,"I really agree with you! We have not experienced war, so we may be careless about international problems but we should care for them and try to make more peaceful world than now."
NBE04523,"There are people who think a cold war is a peace because people didn't killed each other basically by balance of power, but I don't think so. Some proxy wars broke out and many people in the world must have lived with being frightened at a possibility of an outbreak of war. The fall of the Berlin Wall is very important incident for not only Germany but also everyone of the East and the West and turning point of the world. I think it's nice to hold such event! People should think about the Cold War and importance of peace and tell young people who didn't experience war and the Cold War fear of war."
NBE04498,"The events look wonderful and very fun. I want to visit the events for the 50th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall 25 years later. I think they will be held as long as the world is peace, so I hope that peace will be kept forever all over the world."
NBE04497,"I feel enviable that you will visit Germany, and have a opportunity to feel more about the Berlin Wall."
NBE04508,"When I read this article, I was surprised at having passed only 25 years since the Berlin Wall had been fallen. I feel the incident happened in the distant past. However some people might tend to forget about it. It's very important to fall the Berlin Wall, because it had shown the end of the Cold War. So we have to remember it. Moreover the world is on the brink of a new Cold War. Therefore we mustn't forget it and make the same mistake twice."
NBE04490,"I agree with you! I also think it's very important to tell young people who didn't experience the Cold War because the incident is very important for those who live all over the world in our history. Therefore, they shouldn't forget about that and I hope such great event should be held for a long time!"
NBE04491,"I also want to visit the anniversary event in Berlin because I think it's very nice to see the pictures! Maybe such event can be held because the world now is peaceful, so I also want the world to keep that and this event will be continued forever!!!"
NBE04518,"When I read this news, I wanted to go for this event. It is a very good thing that this event in celebration of Berlin Wall collapse was held. This is because it is the proof that the east and the west were reconciled with each other. However, we must not forget that a lot of people were killed in East-West opposition in the past. According to this article, it is said that the new Cold War begins now. I think that the leaders of all over the world should think about misery of the war to stop this war."
NBE04517,"I strongly sympathize with your opinion. Because I was born in the times when we were peaceful, I did not experience misery of the war directly. So, we check war by oneself and must tell a young generation. I think that we can feel importance of the peace by this. This event plays a splendid role in this sense."
NBE04514,"The Berlin Wall is known to everyone in the world because it is symbol of the Cold War. In those days, Germany was separated into two areas. Germany's capital was also separated and the separation was the Berlin Wall. Now that is broken but part of that is remained. I think the event like this is good to be held not to forget the horrible war. We should try not to repeat such thing through this event."
NBE04504,This event is very wonderful. It is accompanied by not only the appearance but also the content. I disturb a symbol of the Cold War and think that it is splendid to celebrate the thing that became free. I will think that it is important that I convey the splendor of the peaceful thing through such an event all over the world in future. I go to Germany sometime and want to go to the place of Berlin Wall.
NBE04499,"The Berlin Wall had already fallen before I was born. Thus I know this matter through book and TV. I could not understand how important the Berlin Wall is. This wall divided German for two parts, west and east. However, I understood what an impressive matter that was. This matter symbolized the finish of cold war. I thought that I would like to know about history."
NBE04493,"I think such an event is wonderful and should be held more. In the event, people can enjoy it and remember the memory of age when Berlin Wall divided Germany. Handing down tragedy is very important."
NBE04485,"After I read this article, I had a renewed sense of the importance of freedom. We should be remembered that The Cold War extracted a price. Some families were separated by Berlin Wall. The weak of society is plagued by international military conflict all through the ages. The nations are meant to protect of human rights. So, I remain dead-set against wars. I pray for peace all over the world."
NBE04507,"Of course I know Berlin Wall because it is a powerful symbol of the end of the Cold War. I learned that many Germans had been deprived of their liberty by the construction of Berlin Wall. We know such a painful past. I think the event which marks the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall would be great. Therefore, people who know terrible influence of the war should tell young people that there was a war in the past. We must not forget a fear of war and victims of war."
NBE04506,"Time flies like an arrow. a quarter century has passed. It was tragedy that a lot family was separate because of politics. There may be the economic gap between the East and West, but I believe Germany and its people. I really like Germany and hope Germany develop. Every time I hear these kind of news, I feel the cold war is far away. Glory to Germany!"
NBE04509,"I think that it is a difficult challenge to change a national flag. This is because, the national flag is a classic thing and informing the country all over the world. I think they may be dissatisfied with a current national flag, but it can be expected that they disturb a past tradition when they change it. In consideration of a thing that It is not only the thing of current people and I want you to think carefully."
NBE04511,"We did not really know the Berlin Wall collapse, but have looked by news and an article many times. It would be an extremely big event for the people of the time, but I think that it will fade onward. However, I think that such an event is very important so that German people do not completely forget it. I think that it is necessary to hand down past trouble because they can live happily like the present. That's why, I think that this event have a very important meaning."
NBE04510,"I really agree with you. We know only the peaceful world so it becomes natural. However, I think that we must not forget that we can live happily now thanks to the effort of past people. I think that it is important to remember and save about the Cold War and Berlin Wall collapse by such an event not to leave them."
NBE04512,We can't feel how happiness thing the peace is because Berlin's wall and the cold war finished before we were born. The young generation like us should feel the importance of peace through this event and consider about the problem of new cold war.
NBE04494,"When I found the title of the article, I felt my interest rising. I think this event is so wonderful. The World War and The Cold War was over, and fortunately, Japan isn't dragged into a terrible war now. However, many small country are still at war. Besides there is no telling when such a war will break out. We must maintain such a event in order not to wars make people sad."
NBE04519,"I was really surprised about this news because I hadn't known that New Zealand is trying to change the national flag. I completely agree with the opinion that that national flags play the important role in identifying their nationalities. If Japanese government tried to change the national flag, I would object to that movement. That's why I love Japanese flag and accustomed to look this flag. This article gave me the opportunity to think about the role of national flags."
NBE04503,"I think your remark is similar to my notion. I think all we can do is to preach the horrible side of war to children and it doesn't bring about good things, but dire things."
NBE04522,"A collapse in the Berlin Wall was to be significant for peace of the world. The wall has cut the same German people off. The family and their friends sometimes became separate. A lot of people tried to exceed a wall, and passed away. These are the very regrettable time. It was happy for German people that the age has ended. The movement of EU is made after fall of the Berlin Wall, and Europe approached peace. I wish the festival in this time continues lengthily, and that peace is kept."
NBE04515,"I think this idea is very good. Although there are big problem between east and west in the 20 century, but there are good relationship now. I hope we will remember the memory of age when Berlin Wall divided Germany."
NBE04502,"I think they are very important events. Because it reminds people how was cold war. And now there are many young people who don't experience the war. So in order not to forget misery of war, such events are important."
NBE04486,I think German people endured a very difficult time. Because Japan and Italy were not separated. Only German people experienced dividing their own country. And we also should remind how terrible Communism was. The difference of quality of life between West-Berlin and East Berlin shows that.
NBE04488,"When the Berlin Wall was fallen, I was not born yet. So, I do not know about the real circumstances, but I hear that ""during my live, I did not think the Berlin Wall was fallen. "" from adults. I think the Cold War has a heavy impact to the world. Now, many countries wish the peace of the world, and and are working hard. Like this article, people can get over a difficulty. Although, many problems still exist now, people wish everything would be going well, and fall of the Berlin Wall will never wearing thin with time."
NBE04487,"I agree with your opinion. Not to forget Berlin Wall, we should tell young people and we never repeat same suffering from war. As young people, we must also learn more about this problem actively."
NBE04516,"There are various histories in Berlin, but ""Berlin Wall"" is well known to everyone. When we go on a sightseeing, we often finish seeing the former site of the Berlin Wall. So it is not easy to understand complicated history. ""LICHTGRENZE (25 Years Fall of the Wall) "" would be the good chance to learn Berlin history for us."
NBE04489,"I was born after Berlin Wall had fallen, the Cold War had finished. Also, there are more children who don't know about the Cold War as time passes. I think thousands of balloons are very important for us because they teach us how forerunners acquired the peace and blessing of it."
NBE04495,"When seeing the title of this news, I had an interest very much. It's because I got a German lecture. The Berlin Wall is a peaceful symbol. Cold war is the affair in the memory for the generation of the parent and my grandparents, but for us, only an affair of ordinary history. Because we have no memory of a war, we have to be making an effort so that a war isn't caused."
NBE04496,"Your opinion is very similar to my opinion. Our generation don't know terribleness of the war, but our grandparents know the war, so we can hear this incident from a person with experience. However, next generation can't hear this from a person close to them, so we have to know and tell the war to them correctly."
NBE04505,"I agree with your ideas but the cold war is a balance of the power. This is the fact and also truth. As you say, some proxy wars occurred in the period of the cold war. However, a lot of ideologies countries and civil wars have appeared after the cold war. We should consider which is better the cold war or post cold war."
NBE04501,"I don't know what the Cold War is like directly or the meaning of Berlin Wall properly. I studied them from history when I was high school student. But I can understand that we must not repeat war and keep piece, so in that piece these balloons are seriously seriously important."
NBE04500,"I agree with you. To protect piece and in order not for this event to fade away, we have to hand it down for next generation. Moreover, we should participate in events like this, for example Hiroshima ."
NBE04525,"When I read this article, I was surprised at having passed only 25 years since the Berlin Wall had been fallen. In the event, people can enjoy it and remember the memory of age when Berlin Wall divided Germany. So I think it's nice event."
NBE04524,"I think so, too!!! I want to visit the event, too! I hope such great event should be held for a long time!"
NBE04530,"I was assent to Mr. Key's thought of changing flag because I think New Zealanders should identify themselves by changing flags and showing independent of British colony. However, changing flags may lead to worsen the relationship between the UK. Thus, it is a too difficult problem between the pride of independent state to international relations."
NBE04527,"I was very surprised to hear the news because I'd never thought New Zealander desired to change their flags. The article told me that one of the reason of it is historical backgrounds, which Japanese also had. So I asked to myself that whether I wanted to change the Japanese flags or not, but my answer was no, because I was very accustomed to seeing our current flag. I think a national flag represents the nation so much, so changing it is not so easy and will give the people much discomfort."
NBE04526,"As the article says, I too think that, even if al-Baghdadi is killed, ISIS would not collapse. ISIS is not a sheer terrorist organization, but a nation (though the international society does not recognize ISIS as a nation). ISIS is not based on dictatorship and has a strict checking organization and rich resources, which enables it to reproduce its leaders. This is very dangerous, different from previous terrorists. We should not underestimate their power."
NBE04528,"I was surprised this article because I have first seen such article telling us the detail of ISIS's organization. However I cannot imagine the present condition of Syria and Iraq even what have happened in Syria and Iraq. These countries are too far for me. Nonetheless, keeping having interest of ISIS and studying of these countries circumstance will lead us to settle this extraordinary complicated problem. I suggest that it is useless to kill Abu Mohammed al-Adnani. The new leader will soon come. Violence makes only violence. However we are now caught up in the maelstrom of violence. Therefore it is difficult to decide weather we should do."
NBE04529,I knew the name of the organization as ISIS. Such violent event is very pitiful. They're a far war and newscasting of terrorism in Japan. But do we have to catch actuality of this world?
NBE04579,"Problems that are related to history, especially among Japan and Korea, China, are very serious, so we have to be careful about them. I think that we can't change the past, and what we should do is to recognize what was happen in the World War 2. To do so, I believe we can think about what we should or we can to show our intensions of apology. This time, Yomiuri was lack of this feeling."
NBE04536,"I had an uncomfortable feeling when I read this article. I think ""Sex slave"" is an inappropriate word describing historical facts. However, is it a solution of this problem? No. There is still no prospect of a resolution. Yomiuri apologized for using the ""word"". That is just the same thing in different word if they had used ""comfort women"". All we have to do is make clear what happened and inform foreign countries of the result."
NBE04540,"When I read this article, I felt very shocked. Also, this problem is very severe problem related to our history so we have to think about that carefully. In my opinion, the impression ""sex slaves"" is clearly bad to describe Asian women forced into Japanese military-run brothels during World War II. I have heard the similar news and watched the scene that the politician who had made a bad impression apologized. In such case, I think what is the most important is not just "" apology"" but ""feeling"" toward women. If they had paid attention to women's feeling, they wouldn't have made such remarks. Therefore, I think we should consider this problem well and as a woman, I don't want to hear such news any more."
NBE04584,"I raise the significance in your opinion. Certainly, the transcription to which Asahi Shimbun and Yomiuri Shimbun apologized may be a problem. The ladies who lived as a military comfort woman in it are being insulted. The one which doesn't look back to the past has the wise saying which has no futures. This is vice-president's West German word. It's legal, even illegality is cruel to the act the Japanese military did. When does Japanese have the obligation to think back to that?"
NBE04561,"The issue of comfort women is difficult problem . Which Words we use is more difficult , because as people read the word, each person take different meaning and take a different impression for it. So in this accident Yomiuri apologized , but I think defending the problem is too hard. When I read the article , I learn how use the word is difficult problem. And media always take care for the problem thinking many aspects. As thinking about one issue, it is important to think about many effects. It is difficult thing, but we also need to think from many aspects like media if we think about some issues."
NBE04572,May I show my opinion? 70 years has passed after the WW2. We have apologized and payed many compensation for some decades. Should we be blamed forever by Korea or China? We need to make new relationships between them.
NBE04586,"When I read this article, I was very surprised. And I felt some anger for this article. Recently, the problem of the comfort woman is often taken up by the media. I think it is a problem that there were the people who was called the comfort woman in wartime. We must be careful that such a thing does not come to pass again. Moreover, the media must pay maximum attention when they handle this problem. I will hope that such a problem does not happen in future."
NBE04582,"When I read this news, I was sad and sympathized. They were harshly criticized for low verbal violence regarding this problem. Comfort woman problem is often announced in Japan. So we should be careful how to announce the manner of the report and news media select the correct English."
NBE04531,"I don't think the attitude of the Yomiuri newspaper leads to national interest. The heart of the problem is that the human rights violations existed. World, for example, United Nations, have already criticized the human rights violations to women by Japan. Even if we change the expression, the evaluation to a case doesn't changes. Therefore, at first Japanese government should preach the importance of the respect for human rights to the nation. And we must never repeat the same mistake."
NBE04570,"I was surprised and sad when I read this article. The world was confused during World War II. Because it is to have taken place in such world, we do not understand the truth, but, as for this problem, it is very difficult. We should promote it steadily now because the woman becomes a social leading figure."
NBE04541,"History is difficult to discuss. We didn't live in that time and we didn't see, touch, listen and feel it actually. Moreover, history is never objective perfectly. It is because history is told by people to people. It's mean there is always a person's mind in history. I think media , such as newspaper, TV, magazines, have to tell people things correctly and try to do their best. I know it is so difficult, however it is their duty."
NBE04574,"I think it is very important for relations to Japan and South Korea how they deal with. This is because that problem is one of the reasons why Japan and South Korea do not get along with each other now. Not only Yomiuri but also Asahi apologized for their making mistakes in their articles. In order to improve our relations, they have to deal with this issue carefully."
NBE04535,"I agree with you on the issue of ""words"". You said that each person takes different meanings and impression for ""sex slave"". That may be so. However, you missed an important aspect of this news. You say nothing about what happened truly. All we have to do is think about what happened and evidences."
NBE04544,"I also think the expression is bad, though the words might such an nuance. So we should sooner use 'comfort woman' not to lay open to severe criticism. The problem is very difficult the point of expression and the reality of the historical authenticity."
NBE04545,"The expression maybe bad and I think it will be cause offense. Media like newspaper ia an existence to publish informations into the world, so it must give right informations because many people know various informations. In the right of facts, the 'comfort woman' might such an nuance, but media should not express as inflaming anger of other countries. This problem is very difficult that it is concerned in pre-war."
NBE04585,"I sympathized with your opinion very much. I think that it is to realize it again about the history to be the most important in this article. And Yomiuri realizes their mistakes again, and I think that they should get directionality of right apology afterwards."
NBE04537,"I cannot understand the action of Yomiuri because Japanese government officially began to recognize that the comfort women were forced, mentioned ""A government investigation in the early 1990s concluded that many of the women were recruited against their own will. "". Besides this, the phrase ""comfort women"" is hard for foreigners to understand because it is uncommon overseas. Therefore, to make our mention clearly, to symbolize our apology to our folly in past, we should use word ""sex slaves"", I think."
NBE04554,"I think it is clear that Japanese military treat Asian woman as sex slaves. So we have to do continue to apologize about this. But It is not good to treat this problem like Yomiuri. And I'm afraid of China, Korea etc using this problem in diplomacy or other negotiation. What we should do is to indicate our position clearly."
NBE04576,"I think that we should not speak easily about such a historical issue. Current we cannot really check the situation. Therefore I think that you should issue words more carefully. In addition, such a problem reacts to the other countries sensitively. This is because it is not the problem only for our country. Therefore, as well as the leaders, I think that domestic people must speak carefully."
NBE04583,"Your point of view is wonderful. Memories are different from records. In addition, a person's mind in history is never objective perfectly, just as you said. So we should have multilateral viewpoints, media literacy, a mind of one's own for International recognition."
NBE04567,"History issue possesses an element of danger. Because, as you all know, it is impossible for us to look back the 'real' historical fact and the realization of provisional historical facts are different in different countries, like Japan and China. Thus, it is no use deciding which country's remark is correct. What we have to do now, that is , in the era of globalization, is to think of the other. A wise man once said 'human is social animal'. We cannot live alone. we always needs others help and also cater to their needs just about every time , just about everywhere. As i said , it is the era of globalization, that is , the era of large community, so there are more and more chances we relate with other race. In a large community what we should do is clear. In order to be social animal , we have to think of others, in other words, needless to say family friends, neighbor and people form other country and so on. It may sound just ideal, but our compassion may make the world peaceful place."

It may sound just ideal, but our compassion may make the world peaceful place."
NBE04539,"This is a very important and difficult problem. It is sure that there was sex slaves in Japan, then, South Korea and China is criticizing this. So, what should Japan do to lead to solute this problem? I heard that Japanese government authenticate there was sex slaves in Japan and apologized to those countries. However, countries still criticizing. I can understand this problem must not be weather, so South Korea and China should keep on telling coming ages this problem, but is it wise to prolong this problem? I think it isn't good for each countries."
NBE04538,"I agree to your opinion. The math medias should be careful to use words, especially which related to other countries or historical things. And also medias should tell next generation this problem correctly not to weather, I think."
NBE04563,"I too think it was inappropriate to use ""direct"" words without considering the feeling of those from Korea. However we should not extend the issue and mention something like ""evidences"" or ""truth"" on what happened in wartime Japan and Korea. The problem of ""comfort women"" is about ideology, not history. In academical and historical viewpoint, there aren't sufficient documentary records to confirm or to deny the painful time that Korean women had in brothels. On this issue, I just want Japan and Korea to recognize it as ""the conflict of thoughts"" and to compromise."
NBE04562,"I feel your opinion is ideal. There are many people and politicians who confuse ""historical correctness"" and ""nation's responsibility"". The argument that Japan's responsibility for ""comfort women"" can be denied because there are historical evidence to support it would be meaningless. Of course the reverse is also beside the point. Emotion and responsibility is one thing, and history another."
NBE04566,"I agree with your opinion. I myself also think that domestic people must speak carefully and have the compassion for the others. By doing so, nice relationships will be constructed between them and our nation."
NBE04560,"When I read this article, I was shocked. The word ""sex slaves"" is too heartless. It implies sexual discrimination among women and men. I don't like to be discriminated unreasonably. Because of asian, women, african-american and so on. There are a lot of things to be changed in the world."
NBE04559,I agree with this opinion. We are sensitive more and more to the way of announcing the manner of the report. A lot of people beyond imagination might feel hurt by one word.
NBE04571,"Your opinion is great. A past is forgotten steadily. So, we should protect the truth for little generation. Media have to careful to tell important thing. Media has difficult problem every time so media need more careful."
NBE04581,"When I read this article, I was very surprised and I felt sad and some anger for this article. Recently, the problem of the comfort woman is often taken up by the media and announced in Japan. I think it is a problem that there were the people who was called the comfort woman in wartime. I think we should be careful how to announce the manner of the report and news media select the correct English."
NBE04580,"I agree with you. The relationship between Japan and South Korea are very bad now. To improve this relationship, I think they have to deal with this issue carefully too."
NBE04592,"I think this problem is so difficult because the comfort women problem caused in the world war II and few people can express it. Thus, they wanted to express in easy words for the generation in Japan and the foreigners who didn't know the problem. However, considering of the comfort womens, they made so serious problem for women's pride. Therefore i think they must not only apologize for it but also try to erase the word, namely, ""slave labor""."
NBE04591,"I agree with your opinion because we can't change the past and we must think what we can o now for the future. However, I think we must not only apologize for their wrong action but also erase the word and get back honor to comfort womens."
NBE04573,This is our shame! I cannot and would not like to understand their thoughts! Their thoughts are like anti-Japan. They should be ashamed of themselves. Ii is not the freedom of speech but concoctions based on the propaganda!
NBE04590,"I felt uncomfortable whenever I have heard news insulting women like that. I think Yomiuri apologized only because public opinion criticized them by chance. I can't find any resolution to solve this problem like that. It is very difficult to change the social notion, so women have only to be disappointed about that news."
NBE04589,I agree with you. It is natural for new generation and foreigners who didn't know the condition of wartime not to care the use of word. I wish they understood that situation among history.
NBE04575,"I am agreeable in your opinion, too. I think that this problem is one of the problems to take time to be settled. As you say, it is the problem that various companies as well as Yomiuri, should be careful about. I think that it is necessary to work on a domestic problem carefully to improve the relations of two countries."
NBE04556,This news is related to historical problems. So it is very difficult and severe. We can't change the history. All we can do is recognize it properly and learn from it. Words are sometimes weapons. We mustn't it .
NBE04542,"I really agree with you. What they did based on emotion. And newspaper shouldn't do that thing. Of course, they should be shamed, and we should be shamed because we accept it."
NBE04550,It is one of the difficult problems of Japan and it is not so easy to solve. But we should solve this problem with South Korea and Asian countries. I feel the word ' sex slave ' is very despising word. We must apologize to the Asian women who forced into Japanese military-run brothels during World War II.
NBE04593,"When I read this article, I understood women have been held in contempt for a long time. This problem isn't easy to solve, but in this time when we know the situation, the publishing must consider whether the words used in articles are correct. The problem ""sex slave"" should be solve on a global scale."
NBE04543,"In this article, Yomiuri Newspaper did not only using wrong expression, but also call for women respect. Although they have freedom of expression, they also have a duty to tell it correctly. I want them to do their best"
NBE04534,"This is one of the difficult diplomatic problem. As historical viewpoint, it is difficult to distinguish what is right or wrong. Even Japanese, this opinion is divided. We also need to think more about this problem, but we often influenced by media. We are required to judge this problem occasionally with attention, and we should have our own opinion about this problem."
NBE04564,I agree with you! This historical problem has been discussed for a long time between Japan and South Korea. However the main topic is not about these words but whether it really happened or not. To make our relationship better we must solve this problem as soon as possible. We can't just stop with this problem.
NBE04558,"Previously, I have heard a story similar to this article. The term ""sex slave"" is so bad. American use the term for the women "" comfort woman"". Also target the same thing, it's surprising that the image is changed so far in terms of using. And Japan has denied having used the woman forcedly at world war II. But using the term "" sex slave"", world people may think that Japan accept to use the women forcedly. All in multilateral, this word was not should be used."
NBE04549,"It is one of the difficult problems of Japan and it is not so easy to solve. But we should solve this problem with South Korea and Asian countries. I feel the word "" sex slave "" is very despising word. We must apologize to the Asian women who forced into Japanese military-run brothels during World War II."
NBE04578,"The problem of this article is how deal with the history among Japan, Korea, and China. I think it is very sensitive , so we have to be more careful about this. When I hear the""sex slave"", I felt so sad and uncomfortable. I thought this word couldn't explain the current nuance. Moreover, the word can give people who read the article the misunderstanding. It will induce the more cracks among the countries. We should consider the problem more seriously on a global scale."
NBE04577,"I agree with your opinion. We should make this article the opportunity to reconsider the the difficulty of using words. As you said, each person take different meaning and take a different impression for the same word. Not only this incident, but also our daily conversation related to this. It is so important to think about what we select words will effect something."
NBE04548,"I strongly support your opinion. The problem is so serious, so we must treat it very carefully. And also we cannot change the history, so we must reflect on it and should never repeat such a thing."
NBE04557,I strongly agree with your opinion. What We should think is not word but relationships to Korea.
NBE04552,"I became sad when I read this article. I do not want people all over the world to think Japanese people see comfort women as sex slaves. Newspapers have a big influence. So, we have to be careful when we write a newspaper article. Otherwise, a problem like this article will happen again."
NBE04551,"I agree with your opinion. The word ""sex slaves"" is too heartless. Newspapers have a big influence, so we should not use the heartless word like ""sex slaves"" in newspapers."
NBE04555,"Your point of view is great. I think so too. History is difficult to discuss. We didn't live in that time and we didn't see, touch, listen and feel it actually."
NBE04553,"I agree strongly with ID14043's opinion. It is important for Japan to build good relationships with Korea and China. So, we have to learn how Japan treated Korean and Chinese during the World War 2. Otherwise, we cannot build good relationship with Korea and China forever. ID14043 express aptly what I want to express."
NBE04532,"I think Yomiuri should find a way to correct the misunderstanding about ""Sex Slaves"". it is clear that there is no academic background about ""Sex Slaves"" according to Sankei. Although Korea criticizes Japan because Japanese government modifies the history as they want. But we cannot find any data about""Sex Slaves"". So if Korea wants to criticize like that, then they should show the data. When the true history is known, both countries can step up the relationship, and do respect the rights of women."
NBE04533,"I agree with your opinion. We, Japanese should understand the history collectedly. And as you say, we must inform that to foreigners."
NBE04588,"I am shocking at this article. Some media surely say that these proofs are dubious, but , regardless of whether these are true, some people mourn. I don't know whether there , in fact, were ""comfort women"", but Japan seriously understand that they are sad."
NBE04587,"I agree with your opinion. I think this dispute is not essential, because other dispute out of essence happen. If so, historical thing which should be disputed will be misty. The number of people who are sad will increase."
NBE04547,"I think using the term ""sex slaves"" is very serious fault and many people in Japan lack understanding of seriousness of WW2 problems. More education of WW2 and other present wars is needed."
NBE04174,"Surprise' and 'Respect' that sums it up. To begin with, I wish the war will come to an end. His vitality and belief are beyond my imagination."
NBE04568,"The historical controversy is so complex and so difficult. In many cases, the truth is only one thing every time but there are many theories which is different of each other. Also, it is almost all impossible that we find common ground in the historical controversy. For this reason I think news papers company shouldn't publish doubtful information because of their great influence."
NBE04569,Your opinion is so great and I think so too. Media has a responsibility of accuracy. So media must so their best and fulfill their duty.
NBE04546,"I agree with you. To deal with South Korea, this problem need to be solved and of course, we should do best."
NBE04598,"Now Afghanistan is one of the least developed countries. Moreover, Afghanistan has been continuing strife. Therefore, I thought Afghanistan is a too poor and dangerous country to improve their people's lives. However, from this news I knew that people in Afghanistan has got the chance to make more stable lives. Nonetheless there are lots of obstacles for residents both to begin harvesting pomegranates and to be employed in right condition by oil company. I suggest that Not only Afghan government but companies, other countries and NGOs have to cooperate the subject to realize more independent economy"
NBE04597,"his phrase ""comfort woman is not history but ideology""is the new idea to me. This notion makes the relationships between Japan and Korea worse one. So, I too thin both of them have to compromise to a degree."
NBE04594,"This opinion is different from other opinion. Important thing is not the word ""sex slave"" . This comment is impressed me."
NBE04595,"It is good and ideal idea to make use of the principal products of that district for a very long time to develop the stagnated economy. Because, especially agriculture like the harvest of pomegranates, it is really ecological and deeply rooted in local people's lives I think."
NBE04596,"You say ""Afghanistan is a too poor and dangerous country to improve their people's lives"", but I think in the first place their poverty promotes bad safety. It may be a vicious spiral. And I agree to your opinion that ""not only Afghan government but companies, other countries and NGOs have to cooperate the subject to realize more independent economy. """
NBE04599,I approve your opinion. I think the rationality and the efficiency from which a local locally produced item is changed to the energy are wonderful. Energy problems will be a problem in the whole earth from now on. But such local match claims evaluation.
NBE04600,"I think it is reasonable that protest democratic election itself. However, there are inconsistency between occupy leaders and students also they continuing demonstrations which are not permitted by police. Both of them should unify their opinion and take appropriate way to protest."
NBE04609,"I think that the judgment of three co-founders of a pro-democracy organization was right. Their primary purpose is realization of Love and Peace, I think. It is getting things backwards to keep on demonstrating and the fight in which many people are injured. Many young people tend to rush headlong into something by only passion as soon as they are encouraged by it, so we must be calm once in a while."
NBE04608,"I sympathized with you about this matter. When people try to fight against a strong opponent, they should have a common will. When their will and opinion are inconsistent, even if they have a common goal, maybe they can't attain it. I think that they should each make concessions and look for an appropriate way to protest and attain their will."
NBE04607,"I think the people's opinion of demonstrators in Hong Kong is right. And I respect their behavior which does a hunger strike. The correspondence of a Chinese government is violent, and it shouldn't be permitted. But demonstration will not settled. And a victims would increase. Other countries except to China and Hong Kong should also behave for both reconciliation."
NBE04606,"I sympathize with your opinion, too. But many participant's are young people, and it's often seen that they do overdone behavior. It's a problem that the person to whom has no relation is interfered. I think a neutral and calmness engine should help negotiations between the government and the demonstration participant."
NBE04602,"I think that it was a wise choice that their three leader decided to surrender. Protest activities sometimes proceed in the wrong direction. For this incident, this remains is oppression and if you keep the protests, the situation even worse. Better to establish a system by once withdrawal would this demo produce better results. I also want the democratization of Hong Kong, I have hope that this demo is bear fruit."
NBE04601,"I agree with you. Young people often go in wrong direction when they become addicted to something. So, their middle-aged leader did wise decision. In order not to go worse, they should make their head cool."
NBE04603,"I agreed with you. Young people often go in wrong direction when they become addicted to something. So, their middle-aged leader did wise decision. In order not to go worse, they should make their head cool."
NBE04605,"I evaluate the choice of 3 Hong Kong Occupy leaders. A result of the demonstration, many people were arrested and injured. And the citizens who join demonstration often went against Love and Peace. People all over the world have already received the actual condition in China from it. So from now on they should change their means of resistance."
NBE04604,"I agree with you. Their means of resistance are against Love and Peace. both the government and people who join demonstration are violent, the situation won't goes better. I hope he situation will get better on this occasion."
NBE04629,"I was surprised at Al-Hathlool's courageous action. It is very dangerous, but using the Internet seems to be effective. This article taught me that the Internet is useful for people suffering from something to tell their circumstances another people all over the world."
NBE04640,"I think Al-Hathlool's action is the good opportunity which Saudi-Arabian people reconsider their custom banning woman from driving car. There is no right scientific and legal reason why women in Saudi-Arabia are prohibited from driving. Not only women but also many man doubt the rightness of this custom. I suppose Saudi-Arabian people should discuss appropriateness of banning women from driving and the way to show the respect of Saudi-Arabian king, society and culture."
NBE04616,"There are still many countries that women have less rights than that of men. Islamic countries are the typical type of it. However, Japan is not an exception. Japan is basically regarded as a country that women don't have enough rights. To compete with other countries in globalization, we should rethink about the women rights."
NBE04631,"I have lived in Saudi Arabia for three years. At that time, I was surprised what strict rules to women there were. Women cannot go out without men and of course are not allowed to drive anywhere. In addition to that, women must wear islamic courts. There are so many strict rules to women. In my opinion, there are no human rights. I think that these customs should be changed in the future."
NBE04636,"I can't understand why the custom Arabian women banned from driving car. There are no human rights. I think there are still many countries that women have less rights than that of men. Also in Japan, women's right is not enough on working etc. We have to take this problem more seriously."
NBE04612,"I agree with your idea!! When I read this article, I was so surprised and thought that it's not good for women to keep from driving. This is because it is apparently not equal and I think ""driving"" has a great influence on our lives as for convenience. In this article, what is the most important is that ""how to use the Internet"" as you said. More and more people can use the Internet and this can help us to communicate with a lot of people all over the world. Therefore, your idea, those who suffer from some troubles should use it to tell people and ask for help, is very nice and effective!!! Sometimes I hear about news that tell us incidents by using the Internet in a bad way, however, we all should reconsider how to use it to ""save"" someone."
NBE04633,"In many countries, there is a disparity between men and women. In particular, it has a striking disparity in the Middle East Asia. It is necessary for an economic development to get rid of it. I was surprised at Al-Hathlool's courageous action. Recently, I did not hear the good news about the Internet. I think how to use the Internet like her is the advantage of the original network system. She chose the right way to spread the information. I think that everyone should have the same right and should not leave a bad prejudice and customs."
NBE04620,"When I read this article, I felt sad. I disagree with the Saudi ban on female drivers. However I disagree with Hathlool's action too. She provoked Saudi. This will only cause a lot of anger. I think that we, people all over the world, should face with this problem. I hope that Saudi woman's right is improved."
NBE04619,"I agree with you. As you mentioned, also in Japan, women's rights is not enough. I want everyone to think over it."
NBE04630,"I agree with this opinion. Not only in Arab countries but also in Japan, women's right is not enough. This matter should be changed instantly."
NBE04639,"I did not now that the Saudi woman was an international trend on Twitter, but I think that it is natural that we can know things like this more quickly than any public institution in the world that SNS is developed and spread globally. SNS can be said to be good when we see it from this aspect. Now, we, human all over the world, have to try to find out the woman together."
NBE04642,I was very surprised that there are countries where women are prohibited from driving. It's not surprising at Al-Hathlool's action using Youtube and Twitter. It's rather good idea to inform all of the world of the real state of discrimination against woman. I think we should consider and support this problem because she told us while breaking law.
NBE04644,I didn't know this news before reading this article. Al-Hathlool's using twitter seems good for improving women's status in Saudi Arabia. People who watch her tweet should start to act for helping her action.
NBE04645,I think so too. I feel convinced of the chance of SNS by this news. I hope SNS help to change the world!
NBE04632,I think that it is a persuasive description. It is because you described on your experience. I agree with your opinion. These customs cannot create peaceful living and human rights. I also think that they should change these customs.
NBE04638,"I agree with you. In Japan, we women cannot work comfortably yet. Women have enormous potential, so we should enhance the rights of women to develop Japan. It is true of Islamic countries, too."
NBE04641,"In Japan, many people think women's rights are not enough secured. However, after reading this article, I have known that Islamic countries like Saudi-Arabia force women to put up with an unfair security. This accident gave us the opportunity to reconsider the rights of women."
NBE04618,"When I read this article, I felt surprised because there are countries where women are prohibited from driving. I hope that Saudi woman's right is improved."
NBE04617,I agree with you. We should improve the equality of the sexes.
NBE04637,"I think your opinion is right. There are still many countries that women have less rights than that of men. Also in Japan, women's right is not enough on working etc. We Japanese have to take this problem more seriously."
NBE04626,Sadly I think so too. Women should be assessed properly and equally. However it is the fact that there are rights that women have but men not . We must discuss the problem more.
NBE04643,"This comment includes actual experience, which convinced me Saudi custom should be changed."
NBE04627,"When I read the article, I remember Arab spring, which happened from 2010 to 2012. As you know well, the ""revolution"" was caused by SNS, like Facebook or twitter. This incident tell us that these SNS have the power to reform the social composition, or overthrow the despotic government. In the case in the article, her courageous action was spread through twitter and YouTube and people all over the world learned about the incident in no time. According to the article, the increasing follower and viewer led to let BBS report her arrest. It is said that sharia, Islamic traditional law, restricts various women's right, not only the right to drive. I hope that such actions make the Islamic world change in order that women can live comfortably."
NBE04625,I was really surprised when I read this article. I did not know the fact that Saudi Arabia bans women from driving cars. This kind of thing is unheard of in Japan. I think that this happening will help women's liberation in Saudi Arabia. I wish that Saudi women will be endowed with various rights.
NBE04624,was really surprised when I read this article. I did not know the fact that Saudi Arabia bans women from driving cars. This kind of thing is unheard of in Japan. I think that this happening will help women's liberation in Saudi Arabia. I wish that Saudi women will be endowed with various rights.
NBE04613,"I did not know this news at all when I read it. The Internet have been spread and at the same time there have been appeared dangerous things. The users of social networking service have a really easygoing way of thinking. On the other hand, using net, we can show people all over the world our ideas and share. It is very difficult to use net."
NBE04628,"when I finished reading this news, I was so sad. I am unbelievable that Saudi Arabia ban female's driving. In Japan, discrimination to woman is small comparatively. But all over the world, female discrimination hash appended. We think it more seriously. We are friends!!"
NBE04635,"When I finished reading the article, I felt it was very difficult problem because it was about traditional sense of value. She must have known her action would cause a lot of opposition. I'd like to see her action was very courageous and important for the future of women. I don't think I'd like to force my value on them, however, if there are women who think their rights are invaded, they can move actively. I think her action was epoch-making step and hope for women."
NBE04634,"I am very interested in your comment because you have actual experience of living in Saudi. And I had the conviction that there are no human right especially for women in Saudi, and if they feel their rights are invaded, they can take some action actively to change the situation."
NBE04622,"I praise Al-Hathlool's brave action which blamed the women's driving car ban with using SNS. I also think there should be equality between men and women. this problem is not only Islamic country, in Japan, there is such problem. So we should take it seriously."
NBE04623,I agree with your opinion. I want people who watched her tweet to act for helping her action too. I wish the day that Saudi women can drive will come soon.
NBE04621,I agree with your opinion. The action she took is praised. I understand how to use Internet to spread information.
NBE04611,I was very surprised that there are countries where women are prohibited from driving. Al-Hathlool's brave action was assessed. And I wish developing social network service will connect to acquire the women's driving rights.
NBE04610,I agree with you. It seems to be accepted notion of women's equality that we were accustomed. We are hard up for a solution and implement a solution.
NBE04614,"In Japan, we have equality rights between men and women. However, there are many countries that women do not have rights to so freely. Each countries and religions have their rules but we should think about women's rights more seriously."
NBE04615,Your experience tells me how restrict rules against women in Saudi Arabia. So I was surprised and we should think about it more seriously.
NBE04724,"I hadn't knew about real situation of acception of immigrants and asylum-seekers in Japan until I read this news and I felt astonished and so sorry. Certainly, refugees are usually held like criminals. Preventing that criminals enter Japan is policy of the government. However, It's wrong for sure to invade human rights. I think that attitude of Japan is invasion of human rights. I think PRAJ should care immigrants and asylum-seekers if it accept them at least."
NBE04665,"I was surprised that the incident was occurred until quite recently because I never read such news. Though it is clear that a policy of immigration in Japan has been made slow progress, I didn't imagine that the circumstances was so severe. Japan is a nation which is exclusive to foreigners for a long time and the fact hasn't been improved much. Maintaining of national traits is good, but the government had better tolerate as much as possible."
NBE04653,The embarrassing thing is that I had never known that asylum-seekers and refugees were in the strict situation until I read this article. I think the reason why Japanese society is indifferent to these people is that we can't imagine the necessity to accept them because Japan is an island country and we are never involved about refugee problems. Japanese society should make a regulation how we accept asylum-seekers and refugees and also have favorable attitude for them and never treat them like criminals.
NBE04684,"I was surprised some problem like the article cause in Japan. The Japanese staff's attitude for detainees was bad. If a man suffer from pain , we should help for him regardless of nation. About Japan accepted only 6 refugees during the year, I think Japan accept more refugee flexibility. Because Japan has a problem about a declining number of children. That is worker will be decline. So I think immigrations help for Japanese work and economy. But I know one more aspect of problem of immigration is related to diplomacy. If Japanese government will think they are accepted, it is not easy. Although it is difficult Japan accepted refugee, Japanese people need to have more interest about the problem. In some country like the united states, people are easy to accept them , as living many races. So , as the globalization is progressing in these days, people should have the sense of cooperation whether Japanese government accept more refugees or not."
NBE04646,"When I read this article, I was frustrated by the government. Japanese society still permits human rights violations. And, Japanese government is too exclusive. Why don't they accept innocent people? At this rate, Japan would be isolated from the world. Emigrants are innocence personified. Cooperation on cross-border issues are government's obligations."
NBE04696,"The Japanese government must notice a mistake. When I read this article, I was disappointed at the government. We have human rights equally. We should think seriously about this article. It is a natural action to help the person who is in trouble. Besides a country neglects medical care, and, therefore, it is a very big problem that a person dies. I cannot trust the Japanese Goverment which cannot protect even a human life under the monitoring. I thought that it was the article that should be reported more in Japan."
NBE04661,"When I read this article, I was shocked. I think there is no racial discrimination in Japan. We should deal with all the people equally and of course we should remember how precious life is. Japan has high treatment techniques and reaches a high level of safety and development, so it is best for Japanese to be a good example."
NBE04712,"When I read this news, I was ashamed of both Japanese society which take no attention to immigration system problem and ignorant myself. Japanese government should take responsibility of improving the circumstance of asylum seekers. However, as this article says, the hard present condition will have been continued, unless the people of Japan require the appropriate actions for asylum seekers from their own government and society. Nonetheless I think that most of Japanese people have not known this harsh environment of asylum seekers. This is because few news media have reported this problem. Therefore first of all, news media ought to cover this problem, and Japanese people including me should get more information about asylum seeker problem."
NBE04706,"I didn't know that condition of support to immigrations is severe in Japan. I think it is too terrible. Not only Japanese but also all people in the world have human rights. Japanese government should think about the acceptance of immigrations and asylum-seekers, like European countries, USA and Canada accepts tens of thousands of refugees and asylum seekers each year."
NBE04677,"I was shocked when I read this article. I didn't know the actual condition of immigration center. Japan is often criticized that Japan's correspondence is slow. I sometimes feel so. But Europe and the US is not always justice. This is very difficult problem. However, we respect for human lives."
NBE04700,"When I read this article, I felt it is insincere that Japanese immigration detention center deal with immigrants. Immigrants are the same human being as us, so we have to treat them fairly and considerately. Moreover Japan tightly restricts the number of immigrants and asylum-seekers it accepts. I suggest that Japan should take in them more. This is because other advanced nation have been accepting more and accepting them would make decreasing Japan's labor improve."
NBE04725,"I'm ashamed of the fact that Japan restricts the number of immigrants. It is unavoidable that people all over the world live together, so Japan should accepts tens of thousands of refugees and asylum seekers each year following European countries, USA and Canada's example."
NBE04723,"This news should be learned more by many Japanese. I was surprised by this news. It's because I didn't find a medical organization to a Japanese immigration insufficient. Japan is an image with a lot of gentle people and no discrimination. But actually there are many countries where an immigration is accepted than Japan. I noticed that service to Japanese is enriched, but there is bad that the attitude to the foreigner. It's a shock news."
NBE04669,"I was so shocked when I knew this news for the first time. What is particularly important is that this case happened in Japan, and it hasn't been treated as a serious issue in Japanese media. It is disgraceful news as one Japanese. I doubt Japanese government. I understand their measure not to accepts lots of immigrants. However it is wrong to deal life lightly, without concern. I hope that treats of immigrants would improve well."
NBE04648,"I think Japanese are not familiar with foreign people. So we cannot accept them. Because Japan is a island country, we don't get used to be familiar with people whose backgrounds are completely different from that of us. And we don't hide our real thoughts that ""They are different. "" So we cannot welcome them. But in the United States or EU, people can move across the border easily. So they can admit people who are not native to the land and are admitted by the other people. Especially, US is based on those who are offsprings of immigrants or slaves. Therefore Americans fight with racism. As a result they have less prejudiced than they used to be. So they can accept people who are different from them. I think Japanese should learn from them a lot and be gentle with foreign people."
NBE04679,"This news tells us how we Japanese are indifferent to immigration issues. According to the news passage, the Sri Lankan man was ignored when he had complained of chest pains and begged for a doctor to be called. The news says that immigration officials just moved him from a shared cell to a single cell, instead of taking care of him. I think it is no exaggeration that this behavior amounts to murder. Moreover, to my surprise, almost same cases were happened at another immigration center. I hope Japanese government takes this accidents very seriously, and take some measures in order not to happen again."
NBE04698,We should be ashamed of this case! It will be said that Japan is tolerant of foreigners from all over the world. I think we should not accept many asylum seekers or immigrants but we must treat them very carefully. That is a duty of receivers. We never accepted asylum seekers if we could not deal with them appropriately.
NBE04697,I agree your thoughts. We have been one nation in small islands for some centuries. Therefore we are not good at getting along with foreigners. It is hard for us to understand other cultures.
NBE04681,"When I finished reading this article, I was very surprised. I haven't known this incident until now. Indeed, Japan don't accept illegal immigration as this article says. However, even so, the fact won't be the reason that appropriate medical practice isn't given. I was disappointed at Japanese Government. A government has to reform a system immediately."
NBE04686,"First, Japan must apologized to their relatives if Japan can know them. Second, Japanese government must take action to improve this situation. If this situation continues, Japan's confidence will be lost! We had better not so much feel not sorry for them but take action in order not to happen such a tragedy."
NBE04709,"I will join the All Japan Model United Nations from 26th to 29th this month and discuss the problem of refugees, so I research about the world refugees' problems recently. I knew that Japan is novel in developed countries in that Japan accepts few refugees. As a Japanese, I am sad that Japan has little capacity and do not help people who seeks help, but I also think that there is a reason for that. That is because Japan is small in terms of the land. However, people who are in Japan should be taken medical care from us and we should keep humanity in us."
NBE04654,"The article says that Japan restricts the immigration intake. Because Japan is an island nation, we sometimes display wariness over non-Japanese. We don't get used to non-Japanese. We have no intention of discriminating against immigrants . However, that is discrimination. Everyone has an indirect hand in discrimination. If you want to catch a criminal, you cannot discover the culprit. What are we to do in order to abolish discrimination? I do not know. What is even worse, I don't think that we can abolish discrimination completely. What is of paramount importance is that a commonplace person could have a part in discrimination."
NBE04664,"I agree with your comment. Certainly immigrations will give good effect for our country's economy, but there is various problems not only as diploma but also as becoming a multiracial nation. If we advance a reception of refugees, the population will be aging and the birth rate declining extremely rapidly. But we have to considerate the reception cautiously."
NBE04668,"I was so shocked when I heard this news for the first time. Important thing for the problem is that the news hasn't been treated as a serious problem in Japanese media. It is so bad. Japan should accepts many refugees and asylum seekers each year like USA, Japan should accepts tens of thousands of refugees and asylum seekers each year following European countries, USA and Canada's example."
NBE04721,"Though I know many immigrants are treated unfairly, I don't think it is so cruel. In spite of such a severe situation, this news isn't told so much, which is problem. And strict restriction of immigration in Japan is also problem. If Japan continue restricting the number, immigrants accepted should be treated normally at least. If possible, more immigrants should be accepted."
NBE04682,"I believed Japanese people are kind against all people before I read this article. However I know it is not true now. The fact written in the article is clearly a racial discrimination. I am sorry for Fernando and another people, and hope the world without any discrimination."
NBE04655,"I felt really sorry and sad to read this news because in general, many foreigners say Japan is a good and comfortable place to stay. Needless to say, reaction of a detention center in Tokyo to foreigners was definitely improper. However, Japanese tightly restrictions on the number of immigrants and asylum-seekers should be considered separately, for small number of crimes of foreigners in Japan may be attributed to these restrictions."
NBE04659,"When I read this article, I was very shocked and thought that this kind of problem was severe. This is because we have to think about ""racial equality"" and according to the article, there are apparently discrimination. In Japan, the number of immigrants and asylum-seekers it accepts is very short so perhaps we have less opportunities to think about them than those in other countries. However, we found the fact that the problems related to immigration have already happened even in Japan!!!! This made me sad and disappointed. I think we must not draw a line, for example, between black and white. The biggest problem is that the Japanese society as a whole tends to be indifferent to the issue. When I watch news on TV or newspaper, many politicians talk about the economy and social welfare but not about the immigration. Nowadays, we live in the big global society and more and more people have the opportunity to meet foreigners in our daily lives. Therefore, I think we should consider ""how we have to behave"" toward them."
NBE04658,"I really agree with this comment because I also think that this kind of immigration problem is related to our economy and our big problem, the shortage of the number of children. This means, if we accept more immigrants and asylum-seekers, we can make the situation which needs more workers better than now. I have one simple question. Why do we usually discuss the economic problem without considering about immigrants? As the article says, we are likely to feel indifferent to the immigrants and asylum-seekers, but we should connect them with our economy. We need more and more young workers in a big aging society, so we all have to reconsider about this matter again."
NBE04676,"This problem is not only the problem of immigration center, but also our country's problem. It's said that Japanese country treat refugees very strictly . and I think so. I think we should accept foreigners more widely. Because of this, we gain some merits. For example, we are able to gain the work force of country. And we are able to promote globalization more and more."
NBE04713,"I think there are 2 problems about this news. First, immigration center is faced a shortage of doctors. Fernando had complained of chest pains and begged for a doctor to be called, but quick response wasn't performed in this case. This is seriously human rights problem. Second, Independent inspection panels should be in place in an appropriate manner in immigration center. If immigration control office personnel are kept under surveillance, they can't threatening or violent behavior. Immigration center like a closed society, it is dangerous."
NBE04711,"I approve your opinion. Japanese government should tolerate immigration and asylum seekers. Even if the government will have continued the strict immigration policy, they should take responsibility for the human rights of immigration. Also I think they should report the condition of immigrant in Japan to their nation."
NBE04707,"I'm interested in your opinion. Certainly, Japan is a island country. So may be we are not get used to getting along with foreign people. But at least we must regard of human rights."
NBE04708,"I really agree with you. This news should be known to everyone, especially to Japanese. Then, we have to take it as a serious problem and deal with it. I want to have more pride in my home country than now to improve problems like this."
NBE04701,"I did not know this news in detail, but was shocked very much when I read. Surely, the person who is accommodated was taken some kind of a crime, but I think that the human rights should be protected. The medical care is not received when taken and I think that it cannot be said that human rights are protected in the life in the prison. In addition, I think that it may become the cause that our country lower the evaluation from the overseas countries when such a case happens in Japan. Therefore I think that the issue of such human rights wants you to argue carefully."
NBE04714,"Your proposals are very precise. If we accept foreigners more widely, we are patient with foreigners. In the end, I wish we rid of segregation in Japan."
NBE04656,"After I read this article, I was very surprised that there is still racial prejudice in Japan. So, I think we have to change this thought and improve the system of immigration. Honestly, I didn't know there is racial discrimination in Japan. Ws students may have learned that there is still prejudice against immigrants, but haven't learned that in our country. So, in the future, Japanese people, not only children or students but also adults should get a chance to know these problem. And then, we could think about solution or improvement of this immigration system, I think."
NBE04657,"I think so too. I have never heard news of such things. So, first, we Japanese people should know this problem."
NBE04692,"Reading this article, I felt the darkness of the Japanese administration. It is one of the very dire cases I've ever heard. May be so far, many people have wanted to change the system, but they haven't. According to prospect theory created by daniel and amos in 1979 , human beings innately make much of or fears losses than earning. So many people think the case terrible but they may not act. Cause if they act, the thing which people can lose is much larger than the thing they get, I think. this is an armchair theory . But if the present situation were to continue, dire situation like this won't change forever. It isn't too much to say that it is dereliction f duty. Thus politicians should immediately take measure ."
NBE04689,"This terrible incident shows the Japan's indifference to immigrants. Our country's immigration policy is rather strict, which unfortunately makes us blind to the fact that such discrimination to those from foreign countries often occur. This is, in a way, something unavoidable in a homogeneous society like Japan. Since there are little immigrants around us, we do not and cannot pay much attention to this kind of issues. Nevertheless, we have to shift such attitudes, aside whether Japan should change the policy or not. What is important in our society today is to share these cases with many other people to realize the situation."
NBE04688,"I generally agree with you. As you said, it is important to ""change the present situation"". But our indifference stems from something very deep and underlying: Japan is an Island nation that have historically been able to be away from foreign country and systems and that have kept its homogeneous nature. It would be very difficult to change that attitude in a blink thorough taking measures, because there are still many Japanese politicians and officers who are ignorant about this issue. So I prefer to say that, first of all, we citizen should ""understand the present situation"" to make our society better."
NBE04683,"I already known about the matter about immigration in Japan. How few the number of immigrants is! Japan should increase the number. It is too small, compared with European countries. Japan faces an aging society with a low birthrate. Accordingly, more and more people who can work will need. Thus Japan will accepts more refugees and immigrants."
NBE04691,"I think your notion of Japan is a little bit idealistic. Of course it is true that Japan has higher technology than other countries, but Japan has invisible dangerous too. The dangerous is discrimination. A wise man once said good medicine is suffering in mouth. Thus that dangerous sometimes become merit. In my opinion, if it were not for discrimination, it is no exaggeration to say that human and nation may become dysfunctional."
NBE04722,"I sympathize with your opinion. I was disappointed at Japanese correspondence, too. And medical care system in a prison to a Japanese foreigner can't be trusted. It's a big problem that it wasn't reported at all in Japan. Japan seemed going to hide an inconvenient part from me. I think that we seem to discriminate against a foreigner over the unconsciousness. But a foreigner is also the same man at the Japanese inside. The development of legislation for foreigner's human rights to be secured will be needed immediately."
NBE04685,"It is good idea that not only students but also adults should get a chance to know the problem. Before reading the article, I don't know the problem. In my opinion, we should accept more immigrants. Because immigrants help for Japanese economy under declining number of children. But I know accepting immigrations is not so easy and simple problem. Therefore we should think and talk about the problem as you said."
NBE04695,"I agree with your opinion. I am proud of Japanese, but this case makes me sad. Japanese media should more pick up like this news. We have to think that this news is important to be connected with each other about a life."
NBE04710,"I didn't know about this news in detail, but it was shocked very much when I read this article. The person who is accommodated was taken crime, but I think that the human rights should be protected perfectly. I was surprised some problem like the article cause in Japan too. The Japanese staff's attitude for detainees was very bad. If a man suffer from pain, we should help for him regardless of nation."
NBE04675,"I was really surprised when I read this article, and I was sad that cruel accident like this happened in Japan. I cannot understand why immigration officials did not call a doctor when Nickeles Fernando complained about severe chest pain. If they called a doctor as soon as he complained about severe chest pain, he might escape death. They must should have called a doctor. I wish that cruel accident like this will not happen again."
NBE04717,"When I read this article, I was really shocked and surprised because I had thought Japan had better immigration system. labor union official Toru Sekimoto said this problem caused partly because Japanese society as a whole is indifferent to this issue and I agree with this opinion. I think if this bad correspondence to immigrants didn't change in the future, Japan would lose confidence in international society, so we have to have more interest in this issue."
NBE04719,"I was surprised how poor the environment for asylum-seekers in Japan. Though the admission many refugees will cause the same case at care home in Japan, we must accept them more because we must respect the other's right regardless of race."
NBE04718,"I agree with you. I think how this problem will be resolved will be not only internal problem but also eternal, namely, international problem. thus we must try to increase the number of acception of asylum-seekers."
NBE04660,"From this article, we can know that Japanese immigration policy and the quality of it is not enough though Japan is a developed country. I think many people will be depressed when they know this situation. And they shout like this "" Japanese government think much of this situation and we should accept more immigrants. "" without thinking. Although they are right in some point, I don't think so. Accepting many immigrants will cause some problem such as increasing poverty , disorder. respecting ones right is very important, however, we should consider the core of problem."
NBE04720,I agree with you. More immigrants should be permitted to work in Japan. I wonder why Japan restrict it such. I hope global place of work realize.
NBE04699,"I think that there are not many sociable people in Japan. It is because that Japan is an island country. In other words, there are not opportunities to interact with foreigner. Being familiar with foreigner is the most important problem to be solved to advance the global society. I believe that such a incident will happen never."
NBE04690,"I was very surprised that such incidents are often occurred in Japan. And I think immigration officials should treat the immigrants who came to Japan more carefully. Because their heartless correspondence made a sri Lanka detainee kill in this case. Furthermore it's the first time to hear that Japan tightly restricts the number of immigrants and asylum-seekers it accepts. I don't know this is good or bad for us. but if it is duty as advanced nations to accept more immigrants, Japan should do it, I think."
NBE04651,"I was shocked to read this article. Japanese does not want to pay attention to immigrants so much, and accept. So, we must have more interests in this problem. I think it relates Japan to island in the sea and we are not familiar with those who settle in Japan. So we should have more knowledge about those people, and work on together government."
NBE04716,"I was disappointed at this news. In Japanese education, teachers say ""you must not discriminate against all the livings "", but this case happened in Japan. I think education in Japan didn't influence people's way of thinking because we didn't experience communication between us and foreigners. So we should have opportunity to interact them."
NBE04705,"I was so shocked when I was read the news. We should remember that our lives are important whether the racial is. I think it is too serious situation that Japanese society is indifferent to the issue though medical care in Japan's immigration system has long been a problem. Also, I think that Japan should receive the refugees and asylum seekers more. It is true that there will be many problems because of doing it and it will take a lot of time to arrange the system. However, it is the duty for the developed countries to cooperate the developing countries."
NBE04671,I was so shocked when I read this news story because one men was dead only because he was an immigrant. I was so sad. I also surprised at the number of immigrants Japan accepts each year. Japan accepted only six refugees during the year. It is so few. I think that We should help each other as same human.
NBE04670,I strongly agree with your opinion. It is shameful trend of Japan accepting few immigrants or asylum-seekers. Japanese should know this issue and we must accept more immigrants and asylum-seekers.
NBE04704,"I was ashamed that I haven't know the fact until I read the article, too. I strongly agree with your opinion , the reason why the society in Japan is not interested in asylum-seekers and refugees is we don't have opportunity to feel the necessity to accept them because Japan is an island country and we are never involved about refugee problems. It is relevant observation I think. All we have to have understanding about this problem."
NBE04680,I agree with your opinion. I think Japan's attitude to immigration is the one like to criminal too.
NBE04703,"I think we have to accept and think very seriously about the news, because it takes part in human right issues. I was very shocked when I read the news, because I believed Japan was relatively tolerant toward every foreign people. Now we have to look again and amend our immigration system, and our view to human rights."
NBE04702,"I agree with your opinion. I also think we should make more constructive system for immigrants as soon as possible. To realize it, we all Japanese people should take a grip on the reality of immigrants for the first step."
NBE04674,"I agree with your opinion. When I read this article, I had shocked too. I could not believe that cruel accident like this happened in Japan. I want the Japanese Government to work out a countermeasure for this problem."
NBE04666,"I personally think that Japanese government should rethink the attitude toward foreign people who live in Japan. If Japan did not do that, other country might look down on Japan as unethical and inhumane country."
NBE04673,"I was so shocked when I read this article and I didn't know that. I wonder that media didn't publish such a terrible incident. I think Japanese people have tolerant mind, so I cannot understand this news. We have to know a sloppy accept system and approve accepting asylum seekers."
NBE04687,"This is really shameful attitude and act in the international society today. Even if they are refugees or immigrants, Japanese should pay more attention to the asylum for refugees and the human right problem. Japan should be a nation of protection of minorities I think."
NBE04672,I agree with your opinion. Japan tightly restricts the number of immigrants it accepts. I think that Japan should take in them more.
NBE04715,"Human rights of a foreigner in Japan are secured in Japan. So such event make me shock very much. Medical technology is advancing Japan, but there is a difference in the rich and poor between the patient. It's necessary to have many people know such news for all people who live in Japan to receive equal medical treatment."
NBE04678,"I completely agree with your opinion. Personally, I think Japan don't have to accept asylum seekers actively, but we might have to do so in some situations, because of humanitarian consideration. This case tells all over the world that we Japanese don't have such humanitarian point of view. In the global society, which ask for international cooperation, this label will bother us. I hope that the authorities regret the case and improve the condition of asylum seekers."
NBE04649,"I think so, too. We should consider how to overcome our mentalities. After that we can truly welcome foreign people."
NBE04647,"This incident made me heavy. The topic whether the Japanese Government should or should not accept immigrants is a completely different problem. No matter who it is, even if it were to be an immigrant, isn't helping a person whose life is in danger the right thing to do? I wish that such a incident like this will never happen ."
NBE04650,"Being look down on Japan as unethical and inhuman country is very scary for Japan. So, I strongly think that Japanese government must decide to take measures. as soon as possible."
NBE04652,I relate to your idea that it is the duty for the developed countries to cooperate with the developing countries. Developed countries should receive more refugees and asylum-seekers even if that is the case we have to arrange our systems.
NBE04663,I was so surprised this news and I thought we should think this problem more seriously. And I thought Japan should accepts many refugees and asylum seekers each year like USA.
NBE04662,I was frustrated too. I believed that Japan respects human rights. So I was so sad when I heard this news.
NBE04694,"I was surprised because I didn't know this news. Every people who has various background is equal and we must not discriminate every people according to their colors of skin, radical difference and nationality. Japan is inferior to other countries in the matter of nationality. We must solve this problem as soon as possible."
NBE04667,"Nowadays, reception of immigrants is very serious problem around the world. Considering this news, Japan should expand right of immigrants. But given other countries' situations, there will be a lot of oppositions. So immigration problem is needed to be treated cautiously."
NBE04693,I agree with you. Japan has advanced medical technology. But It is so bad that Japan doesn't exploit this technology. We should know these problem then.
NBE06636,I think present Japanese system is not good. This system leads people to wrong direction. Immigrants and asylum-seekers now being regarded as nothing. This situation may lead immigrant's worse position. Sempra should care immigrants and asylum-seekers if accept them.
NBE06141,"When I heard this news for the first time, I was shocked because I did not know that there is a lot of problems about the immigrants in Japan. I think there is big problem with respect to this news. It is that it was not to have been able to save the life that they should have been able to save. They should have helped him whether a patient was an immigrant. We must do immediately to deal with this problem so that the same trouble will never it."
NBE07366,"Similar cases occur frequently in Japan. For example, an Iranian man dead in March 29, 2014 and a Myanmarese man dead in October 14, 2013 at immigration facilities. Japan should change correspondence immediately to prevent immigration center from increasing victims"
NBE07365,"I think so, too. Japan should change its too exclusive attitude."
NBE06896,"I think this news shocked many Japanese people. That is because until I listened to the news for the first time, I expected that there weren't the problems about the immigrant in Japan. The Japanese government should make the law system for immigrant to live as comfortable as Japanese. One of these problems is that few Japanese people know and are interested in this accident of immigrant. The most Japanese are shamed as Japanese for listening to this news, the better the environment which immigrant live is."
NBE07432,"I think Japanese government is responsible for this accident. We should make some laws to protect refugees. Globalization goes on promoting. many refugees will come to Japan, whose society is safety."
NBE07331,"I knew that immigration is a serious issue in Japanese society compared to other developed countries, but I did not know details or typical examples. This news is really shocking, but I can think of nothing I can do to help this situation. Also, I think Japanese medical care system is an imminent problem in terms of not only immigrants but also for increasing elderly people. We have to think about how to make it possible before claiming to welcome more immigrants or to boost low birthrate."
NBE06281,"I strongly agree with your opinion. Many people pretend to be honest, and call for peace. It is not bad thing , but we need more concrete idea."
NBE04727,"I worry about the secrets law might infringe the freedom of expression. Why do they think that they cannot defend the national interest by the National Public Service Act(existing law)? The government should explain this issue. The purpose of the news is to criticize the government. Thus, news media have to reveal the secret of the government. The government must not set ""Secret"" freely."
NBE04732,"There are some people who are oppose to secrets law, but can we say all of Japanese people are interested in it? Last year, there are many demonstration against this law, but lawyers mainly composed it. Perhaps secrets law infringe on our freedom of expression, so we should not only develop of the law, also enhance our interest in it."
NBE04726,"I think so too. We should get more understanding of this issue. Therefore, the government has to strengthen the disclosure of information. Why the secrets low is necessary? Government hasn't confidence of the people if doesn't achieve accountability about this question."
NBE04739,"The problem which is included in the secrets law is its vagueness. On one hand we can protect ourselves from the other countries, but on the other hand, we may not know the essential information for our lives. Such is discomfort that we cannot know the fact and cannot decide what we do. This is so controversial issue. Thus , we Japanese consider it carefully."
NBE04737,"Even though these law have great power, they are in some way necessary, because every nation surely has ""key secret information"" about troops, national security, technology, and the like, which the conventional law system was not always able to protect. So I do not say the security law - much stricter version of the previous law - should be absolutely banned. And the idea of establishing ""the check organization"" that is composed of prominent scholar and bureaucrats is also plausible. However, as John Acton said, ""power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely. "" In fact, the definition of ""secrets"" is still very vague and arbitrary, which might violate our freedom of speech. What is needed is a clear standard and so-called ""limiters"". In my opinion, a few liberal scholars should be adopted to the check organization as members, and the media's coverage of the law should be critical, so that government limits its power that can be absolute."
NBE04745,"Certainly, I also think we should be ashamed of Japan's attitude toward immigrants and asylum-seekers and Japan should change the policy. However, I don't think Japan should accept tens of thousands of refugees and asylum seekers. Compared with other countries, Japan is small country and legislation does not go ahead through Japan. For these this reasons, I strongly disagree with this comment."
NBE04736,"The article points out the Japanese society is indifferent to immigrants and refugees . I sympathize Japanese society have a interest in the problem which is related to themselves. The classmate commented two points, so I choose it. First, Japanese government's attitude. Second, the problem is serious, so the article should be reported more in Japan. I sympathize the two points."
NBE04747,"I think the secret's law will make a lot of criminals who haven't confess their sins but commit the crime. though Japanese government need get the confidence from international society especially US, the rights of people of Japanese must have priority over it. We must establish trusted third party and continue to fight the law."
NBE04746,I sympathized with yo so much. I think we must increase the number of people who are interested in the dangerousness of the secret's law. We must try to generate information to indifferent people.
NBE04742,"I strongly agree to making a law to protect a secret. There are some reasons, but it is one reason that many countries except Japan make such a law. I think that a lot of very important information exists in running a nation. Of course, it may not be said that useful information for some people may not be considered to be a secret. However, it is too dangerous to announce all information like our country. Even if information says all as for the coming times, it is not exaggeration. Therefore I strongly agree to make such a law and protecting important information."
NBE04743,"I think that more people should be interested about this law. This law is not a simple law. Therefore I think that it is necessary to understand at first what kind of law it is definitely. There are a lot of laws that only expert people know, but, as for a lot of these laws, it becomes news. There is the person whom the agreeing person objects to, but thinks that it is important that each has one's opinion. Therefore I am agreeable in your opinion that the people should make more interest."
NBE04740,"I agree with This comment. Looking back, There may be alt of people who should be blamed too. But as him (commentator), when I hear this news, I was confused and indignant too."
NBE04731,"Protecting our national secret is very important thing. However if a government ignore the public's right to know it will be difficult problem. Japanese once experienced world war, and have make good use of the experience. It is natural that we be worried whether this Japan's secrets law lead the next war. So, promoting the national interest, Japanese government should make great efforts, I think."
NBE04735,"To tell the truth, I'm against the state secrets law. Certainly, thanks to the law, Japanese government would administer the country easier than otherwise because politicians, bureaucrats and diplomats could negotiate a lot of things with counterparts without showing our nation's weak positions. If they can do so, the negotiation would turn to our advantage, and we Japanese enjoy the benefits in our daily lives. However, just because the government tries to maximize national interests, it doesn't follow that the government can deceive a nation and hide secrets which shouldn't do so. I think that giving priority to national interests doesn't mean that they can ignore the rights to know which all of us have. Therefore, I disagree with the state secret law."
NBE04738,"I heard this news for the first time, and was very anxiety about a return to the days of Japanese militarism. The new law would be protect from intelligence leaks on the one the one hand, would limit public right to know on the other. Every law includes benefits and risks. So the government must explain the citizens who are opposed to it until they understand. And even if his approval ratings fell down, It shouldn't forgive that the change was being rushed through parliament with little public consultation, I think."
NBE04744,"I also felt Japanese immigration system was very fragile, and it is the matter of grate. We should make better system of immigration as soon as possible."
NBE04730,I do not think so. The right to know is not like as you say in the academic world. And there is no relation with the information which we can get through the right to know. National secrets are admitted by any constitutions in the world.
NBE04741,This is the great first step of Japan. We had no rules or laws about secret information. We never surrender the spies. I believe this law make Japan better. I cannot understand why the left disagrees the law. The law is necessary to be strong Japan.
NBE04728,I know you're right. it's a double bind. Introducing a law always entails demerit. Japanese government should've asked public's opinion about that.
NBE04729,"The Secret Information Protection Act, does indeed seem to be a necessary and reasonable way to protect information from cyberterrorism and foreign espionage. However, there is a danger of information that is important or inconvenient to the Government being hidden from the public. In addition, the checking system is unclear, which jeopardizes the people's right to know. The Government must hurry and set up a third party committee that can check and decide classified information on a more neutral stance."
NBE04734,"Maybe secrets law looks necessary and effective to prevent the leak of state secrets. However, by applying this law, government can arrest people who give disadvantage to government and details of this arrest will not be reported to us. So I think this law is not always good."
NBE04733,I agree with you. This new law might threaten freedom of expression. And I think we citizens should tell the risk more.
NBE04752,"I agree with your opinion. I also feel that the Japanese policy for refugees is too severe. And it leads to human rights violations. However, we will not change a policy by this matter immediately as an opportunity because the policy for refugees is always a fixed thing. Therefore, I think that the Japanese Government does not change a policy at a stretch, but should change from overall consciousness in Japan. This is important as problem in the future of Japan."
NBE04751,"Certainly CIA of torture grated ignore the human rights, it is most also to blame the other countries are those cruel. However happens this time be only the actual situation of the CIA of torture came to light, other countries is not necessarily not to be such a thing at all. China's is showing a severe attitude than other countries I think because they related political problems. In any case, each country as such a thing is no longer should be effort."
NBE04748,I thought the United States respect human rights. But it turns out that it is not true. America blame other countries because they dismiss human rights and started a lot of wars in the name of human rights. American people also tried to protect and declare human rights are sacred after the independent war. So they made the first constitution in the modern history of the world. It is a dark history of America.
NBE04750,"When I heard this news, I was shocked and scared. I thought America respected human rights but that was wrong. Their tortures are so horrible."
NBE04749,I agree with you. Their war for protecting human rights was wrong. They should think their actions again.
NBE04760,"When I found the headline of this news, I thought it was very interesting for us because all of us are related to ""eating"" and ""health"". Recently, I often drink coffee and perhaps many people are more likely to drink coffee. For example, famous coffee shops such us STARBUCKS, there are always many people and maybe we tend to consider ""it is cool"" to do works drinking a cup of coffee. However, this article reminds us how healthy drinking tea is. I live in Shizuoka, where tea is famous for, so i think I will more cups of tea than now and we should keep our health!!"
NBE04804,"I was so surprised by the suggestion that tea is better for our health than water. I thought that the water is the best drink because it contains nothing extra. Through this news, I knew that tea's ingredients are good to our health so we should drink tea. However, we should remember that drinking tea too much makes us worth in terms of the health. We should only three cups of tea a day."
NBE04787,"I was really surprised at this statement ""Drinking tea is actually better for you than drinking water. Water is essentially replacing fluid. Tea replaces fluids and contains antioxidants so it's got two things going for it. "" Being healthy is so important for us all human beings of course. I've loved to drink tea for long time, so I'll try to drink more."
NBE04784,"When I read the head line, I was interested in it. I drink water every day, but I drink little cup of tea. So that is disturbing news for me. My family tend to get cancer, so it is good news for me that Tea has the effect of against cancer. Although I think I drink tea as much as possible, everything is said excessive is not good. So people including me after hearing the news , they tend to drink tea so much . But people should revive the news as advice. It is good to drink tea, but it take care of excessive drinking."
NBE04810,This news is good news for me absorbed in a diet. It's surprise for something to excel to have matched water. But is the excessive drinking of excessive genki drink really good for a body? A question is left.
NBE04756,"I was surprised to know that tea is not dehydrating and it is a healthy drink. I do not think that tea is bad for our health. However, our ancestors drink water because there is not tea long , long time ago. So, I believe that something we have eaten and drunken for long time is healthier than something we created. I was shocked to know the fact that tea is healthier than water is. We often misunderstand a fact because we believe ""common sense"". We have to remember this lessons and bear in mind."
NBE04813,"I think that this article is very important for us. Because the health is one of the things which is the most important in our life. What I was surprised at in particular is that tea is better for health than water. Since I like tea, I always drink it. However, I feel that I drink tea too much. According to this article, the excessive drinking of the tea seems to be bad in health. So, I think that I want to be careful not to drink tea too much from now on."
NBE04811,"I know that the correspondence to an emigrant is very severe situation in Japan. However, when I read this article, I felt that the situation was too terrible. All the human beings have human rights inherently. Not to mention it, it is not a thing applied to only a Japanese. As you can see, I think that it is not a permissible thing not to give a foreigner medical care. Japan should think about the acceptance of immigrants and asylum-seekers ."
NBE04793,"I like a tea more than a water. So, when I read this article, I was very happy. I want to spend healthy life because sicking life is bad for us. If drinking tea is more healthy than drinking water, I drink tea only! I'll try it."
NBE04809,"This article is information useful for the girl who worries about health and a diet. It's said that they have the various effect on tea. For example, it was revealed that a catechin has the action against which the flu virus infection is defended. And, Recently, ""Tea-tox"" which makes waste discharge to the interior of the body is popular in Europe and America. I'll try to drink more!"
NBE04807,"This is good news for me. This is because I drink much barley tea in a day. However, this article says only ""tea"", so I cannot know weather barley tea is useful or not. If the tea is pointed black tea, I examine to change my drink from barley tea to tea."
NBE04766,"I am glad to read this news because I drink 2 or 3 cups of tea in a day. Actually, for most of the Japanese, drinking tea is one of the most common custom of everyday lives. I personally think we the Japanese should cherish the old tradition such as drinking tea."
NBE04779,"I have heard that tea is good for human health. The fact that tea protects your teeth is very surprising. I am from Shizuoka, where is famous for tea. However, I rarely drink tea. After reading this article, I will try to drink tea everyday."
NBE04797,"When I read this article, I was really surprised that drinking tea is good for our health, especially cancers, heart diseases, and teeth. I drink a cup of tea everyday and I think it is more delicious than water or some soft drink, so I was happy to hear that. I decide that I would not change my routine which drinks it every morning."
NBE04761,"Drinking 3 or 4 cups of tea is easy for us Japanese. We drink tea in daily life without thinking. Moreover. it's good news for us that Tea is good for health. However, I don't think we have to make it a habit. I think drinking tea is our traditional habit and we know how to enjoy it. I don't think it is good to take a cup of tea from a feeling of duty. Although it is important to keep our health, we should enjoy our culture."
NBE04802,"I was surprised that tea is such a healthy drink. Recently, I think there is a trend STARBUCKS is cool and many people are more likely to drink coffee. May be i'm one of them. So, i think the consumption of tea decrease. But this is good news!! We are the people in country of Ryokucha. Let's try to drink more tea!"
NBE04759,"I really agree with your idea that to be excessive is not good in everything. After having read this article, I also made a decision to drink more cups of tea, but at the same time, I would try to follow your advice!!! Anyway, I think it is a good thing for us to do what we can do for improving our health!!"
NBE04757,"You said that you drink tea only. However, Everything in moderation. I think that drinking too much tea is bad for your health as might be expected. Health means a lot of different things to different people. If you are health-obsessed, the attitude towards your health has an adverse health effect in a nice little twist."
NBE04765,"i was very surprised to see the news because I love tea and I always drink it. I've ever heard that drinking coffee is good for our health before, so it is in the nature of things that tea is healthy because it contains caffeine. But tea is useless when we have heatstroke, we can't recover without water. In that kind of meaning, I think water is healthier than tea."
NBE04764,"I think so too. I've never known that tea has a good influence for health though I have known that drinking coffee is good for our health . I also love tea, so I like tea more than ever by reading the article."
NBE04812,"I am very interested in your opinion. I like Starbucks, too, and also consider ""it is cool"" to do works drinking a cup of coffee. In addition, when I watched the person who walks while drinking coffee of Starbucks in a town, they looks very smart. I understand that tea is healthier than coffee. However, I think I continue to drink coffee. But, I also want to drink Shizuoka's tea."
NBE04777,"I was surprised to know this fact. But I often drink coffee than tea, so I wanted to know about coffee. It is interesting and healthy for us for every restaurants and shops to service tea for free because of helping by government. It lead to promote health fitness of the people."
NBE04805,"I was so surprised by this news, and I had drunk tea every day, too. However, it is important that we should not drink it too much. Thus, we don't have to drink more tea than now."
NBE04796,"I was interested in this topic because this topic told about health. Everyone wants to live healthy. I was surprised at that tea is better for health than water. I do not drink tea everyday. Therefore, I try to drink tea everyday. However, I think that it is important to pay attention to drinking too much is bad for health."
NBE04792,"On the face of this article's headline , I thought that ""what a coincidence! How lucky I am!"" Actually, I'm habitual drinker of tea. In terms of health benefits that tea gives us, I knew a little bit like, it'll protect against heart disease and some cancers. But I didn't know the fact that tea can impair the body's ability to absorb iron from food. As remarked in the article, foods containing iron and tea eaten together are said to disagree with you. So I gonna reconsider my habitual drinking of that fluid. And vice versa, I gonna recommend my friends to drink it to keep themselves healthy. It isn't too much to say that this is the age of Health-minded. So intrinsic power of food like this will catch on among people. In terms of business administration, more and more company should take advantage of this aspect, i think. It'll not only benefit company but make Japan the healthiest country in the world."
NBE04808,"I am jealous of you, and What a waste!!! I liked green tea so much I could die. I have heard that Shizuoka tea is more delicious than other region tea. I want you to proud of the staple products of Shizuoka!!"
NBE04768,"I was very surprised when I read this article. I still can't believe that drinking three cups of tea a day is as good for you as drinking plenty of water. I can understand that tea may even have extra health benefits. However I am worried that a person who doesn't drink water, drink only tea will appear. I think that drinking water is so important for our health too."
NBE04758,I think so too. Drinking tea is something happiness or routine for us. So we shouldn't make it a habit. Whoever wants to put into practice may try it.
NBE04788,"I myself drink cups of tea, and I am pleased to read this article. As this article said, tea has potentials, which shows the prospective that Japanese beverage companies can sell tea products. But, in my experience, drinking too many cups of tea sometimes makes my body heavier. And there are evidences that too much tea causes urolithiasis. so in the long term, I prefer to drink water mainly."
NBE04791,"I liked your comments. I once heard the efficacy of the coffee. It also has the lot of benefits, such as activation of the brain, protection against diabetes and so on. But as one of the tea lovers, I wanna praise its efficacy!"
NBE04789,"I think you have a good point. Owing to its benefits, tea can be a big business opportunity, which might lead a win-win relationship between societies and companies."
NBE04821,"I was surprised to find to have tea better for a body than I drank water. There is a kind of much in tea. I'd like to have various tea. But the excessive drinking is bad for a body. Caffeine is in tea. There is dependence in caffeine. This discovery is quite good thing, but I think a balance of the amount which drink tea should be considered."
NBE04767,"I agree with your opinion completely!! I am worried about that a person who don't drink water appear. However, I also can trust that tea is health for us. So I would try to drink tea much!!"
NBE04822,"You can be convinced your opinion approximately. But please don't forget that we should pay attention to excessive drinking of tea. If I come, the time when a lot of people carry a tumbler with ""tea"" around is fascinating like STARBUCKS COFFEE, isn't it?"
NBE04782,"When I read this article, I was surprised that tea is healthier than water. For a long time, I have a opinion that tea has some negative effects, like a diuretic. I think that it is not good to drink more than a cup of tea. However, I read this article and changed my mind. It is interesting. I would like to know what food is good for our health or not."
NBE04783,"I try to drink tea as much as possible. However, I can't get into habit of drinking tea. As I read your article, it is exactly what I think! If I drink water, I feel guilty or stress. So it is better to care about such a little things. I think also people are healthy as they don't feel stress . If they feel a stress, it is better to stop the behavior. The problem is not only this article but also many thing in an information society. For example, Many women tend to have a interest in a diet. In a real world, there are many information about a way to diet. They believe and try these information. We live in information society, so we need to judge whether information from source or not and care about overdo anything. In short, it is important that excessive behavior is bad. Your comment relieved me of my stress. Thank you so much!"
NBE04794,"I was surprised, too. Since I think water is simple drink so water is more health than a tea. But, I like a tea more than water. I am lucky. I want to be more health drinking a cup of tea."
NBE04806,"I didn't know that tea is healthier than water, so I was very surprised when I read this article. I every day drink a lot of water, because I thought water is the best than any other drink. I don't like to drink tea because it will stick stains. But I read this article, and knew tea is healthy, I will drink tea everyday."
NBE04819,"Because I have heard that tea is good for health, I drink tea everyday. But I didn't think tea has effect to heart disease or cancer, which is surprising. Reading this article, I want to know healthy food and drink. So I thank this news for changing my mind."
NBE04824,"These days I drink only water, so I'm surprised that tea is healthier drink than water. I will drink tea instead of water. I wish researchers discover more accurate merits of tea."
NBE04823,"I'm surprised at this news, too. I thought that the water is the best drink because it contains nothing extra. According to this article, excessiveness is not good for everything."
NBE04795,"I also want to spend healthy life. Recently, we can get more information about our health by using the Internet. I try to drink tea more than ever. I am worry about your health if you drink only tea. Please be careful!"
NBE04816,"When I read this headline, I wanted to know the detail of this article. I have believed that water is the most healthy in drink because water doesn't contain any extra ingredients and so I'm drinking American famous water 'FIJI' every day.

NBE04763,"I was happy to hear this news because I like tea and I drink every day. I am interested in healthy food and drink to keep well.

Now, many people tend to care their health. Many kinds of health food are sold. This remarkable fact will effect the companies related to food and maybe make them change the strategy.

I will tell the people who have the uneasiness as same as yours. It is also important to tell that taking care of excessive drinking!Like me, person who LOVE drinking tea, should restrict the amount of tea which is drunk a day."
NBE04799,"I am very interested in the news because I love drinking tea. I had believed water was the most healthy drink, so o I was very surprised to know the fact, and I felt it was very happy news for me. I want to know the fact with more details and right away introduce new custom of drinking three cups of tea per day."
NBE04773,"I agree with your opinion. I love drinking tea too, and I drink tea everyday. So, when I read this article, I was happy just like you."
NBE04798,"I also think it is the revolutionary discovery which breaks our ""common sense"". I am very interesting to know like the fact because I can feel human is able to advance step by step. I'd like to know the news with more detail, and hope any new fact will also be discovered in the future."
NBE04772,"I was really surprised to know drinking tea is healthier than water. I seldom drink tea so far, however, I try to drink a cup of tea every day. I know that tea has caffeine , so I would drink it every morning."
NBE04776,"I agree with you. I was also really surprised that drinking tea is good for our health, especially cancers, heart diseases, and teeth."
NBE04771,"I think there is a trend STARBUCKS is cool , too. I am one of the people who don't know how to order at STARBUCKS. Please teach me. Then I would go there and order tea!"
NBE04786,"I think so too. I was so interested with this headline which is related to ""eating"" or ""health. "" The present aroma, goodness for our bodies, and long long history fascinate us. It is nice that your hometown is one of the biggest growing area of tea!!!"
NBE04775,"I disagree with the part of ""Drinking 3 or 4 cups of tea is easy for us Japanese"". Japanese lifestyle is affected by foreign culture, and Japanese lifestyle continues to change. I think that the amount of tea Japanese people drink has been decreasing. So, we cannot sweepingly say that drinking 3 or 4 cups of tea is easy for us Japanese."
NBE04753,"I think that tea is familiar with Japanese people. And we enjoy the benefit of tea naturally. Maybe tea take part of Japanese healthy lifestyle. But we cannot sleep when we drink too much tea. So if caffeine less tea are spread wildly in Japan, it is expected that the consumption will increase."
NBE04754,"Killing two birds with one stone is good explanation in this article. I usually drink not tea, but water. So, I want to find my favorite tea as you, and continue to drink!"
NBE04755,"When I read this article, I was excited at effects of tea. Though I do not mean I do not like tea, I drink only water recently. However, this article motivates me to drink tea. As Japanese, drinking tea is a kind of culture. It is very happy thing."
NBE04814,"I was very happy when I read this article. I like tea, and drink three cups of tea everyday : breakfast, lunch, dinner. I think tea is not bad, but not good : neutral. When I read this article, I was very happy and surprised. I decide to drink tea."
NBE04838,"I love British Royal Family's involvement in a wide range of activities that called ""Noblesse oblige. "" Especially Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge are popular and very influential among people. So their activities will make international relations be better one I think."
NBE04834,"They are very popular around the world. Their activities are admirable. It is said that Americans like ""royalty "". Emperor of Japan also do such activities too. He devotes himself to government affairs. There are various opinions about royalty. But their attitudes is wonderful."
NBE04827,"I like this kind of news very much, especially related to prince William and Catherine because I'm interested in Britain. They are very famous and popular even in Japan but I didn't have enough knowledge about activities by Royal Family's. Therefore, after reading this article, I wanted to search about their activities more and more and could get information! I knew about ""Noblesse oblige"" in detail and I found this idea very nice. Actually, I cannot experience their activities and feelings but I imagine that they have both good points and burdens. I think that ""what they do"" is very important and has a great influence on people all over the world, so in this article, I think it's very nice to visit a child development center and the happening that Catherine was mistaken for being a princess from Frozen made me laugh. As a lot of people pay attention to activities by Royal family, I think they are so admirable and have great meanings. I hope that they can help to promote relationship between countries."
NBE04858,"I love Prince William and Catherine very much. I watched the TV broadcasting of their marriage ceremony in 2011. I felt so, so happy to watch it! And I am looking for seeing their second baby. I want them to come to Tokyo with their children. I believe that their visit to many countries conducts relationship betweens countries to better course."
NBE04825,"I think their visit to the U. S is not the one which is criticized because the U. S has no royalty and royal family is very popular among American. Indeed there is a serious problem about shooting or choking black guy by white police officer in the U. S, but it's quite irrelevant to the UK and duke and duchess are popular even among black people, for example Lebrone James mentioned above. Therefore, their visit made a good effect on the country, I think."
NBE04826,I also drink tea everyday and I think drinking tea is quite natural in Japan and I'm strongly proud of this custom. He says we have to cherish our custom and I sympathize with his attitude to our grate tradition.
NBE04840,"I liked and agreed with your comments. in the era of international exchange, British Royal Familys attitude may become the model for viaduct of peace. Their popularity and sincere attitude will be the model which we should follow. Although some have negative opinion about them but I think they are wonderful and good symbol of UK."
NBE04854,"When I read this news, I was very surprised. I am very interested in British royal family. So, this event make me glad. I always thought that people of the non-royal family did not associate with the royal family. By this matter, the way of thinking of people was replaced. Triggered by this, I hope that the relations of all the countries of the world become better."
NBE04853,"I love Prince William and Catherine very much, too and I also felt happy. The second baby is born soon. This will bring joy in the world. By this matter, i hope the relationships among many countries become better and better."
NBE04855,"This comments said that ""it's wrong for sure to invade human rights. "" I especially sympathized this. I also think Japan's attitude toward immigrants and asylum-seekers and PRAJ should change a policy. For these reasons, I strongly agree with this comment."
NBE04857,"It's because his opinion is too extreme, that I can't sympathize with his comment. You can't agree to the comment which has only tea. When drinking too much even if it's good for a body, it's bad for a body."
NBE04842,"The royal couple is very famous around the world. so, this activity make us happy. Originally, I like the British royal family. After I read this article, I like this couple more and more. They have very big power. So, I think that they should use this power for peace of world. Having good relationship become method of the peace. I want them to continue this event."
NBE04845,"They are famous all over the world. They are loved and attracted attention by people in the world. Therefore their action is very big influence. This problem was causing a big ripple all over the world. Therefore, I think that I want you to have a good influence not the bad influence. If their power is used to become peaceful in the world, I think that you should be used at many opportunities."
NBE04850,"I very love this couple, and they loved a lot of people in the world. I can't wait to see their baby! I hope they will come Japan. And I think Emperor of Japan also do such activities too. Prince William and Catherine's attitudes is very wonderful."
NBE04849,"I agree with your opinion. When I watch this couple, I feel happy! I hope they visit to many countries conducts relationship betweens countries to better course."
NBE04851,"It is because I am same as her opinion ""drink tea as much as possible, everything is said excessive is not good. So people including me after hearing the news , they tend to drink tea so much . But people should revive the news as advice. It is good to drink tea, but it take care of excessive drinking. "" I think everything is said excessive much as possible too. We should control myself."
NBE04859,"The royal couple is very famous in the world and has an enormous influence, so they are being taken notice by the world all of the time. Superficially their life is simply magnificent and bright, not only that, but they live with struggling with a heavy feeling. Their word and action can have a powerful influence on the international situation in a positive and negative way. They are in the terrific position. I anew notice that by read your comment."
NBE04860,"British Royal Family is loved by people all over the world. William and Catherine took the world by storm 4 years ago. This time they are given attention, too. I want to know why Royal Family is loved like this."
NBE04861,"I like this kind of news. I'm interested in Britain, too! You searched about Royal Family's activities to satisfy your curiosity. That's very nice action. Voluntary action makes you an intellectual. I will follow your example!"
NBE04830,"The british royal couple is very famous around the world. so, this activity make us happy. I like the news!!! And, I love Prince William and Catherine very much. I am berru The second baby's news gives us great pleasure. This will bring joy in the world."
NBE04829,I agree with you. I want the royal couple to promote the peace of the world.
NBE04844,"I like the british royal couple too. Therefore I am glad of the news to make people of the world happy in this way very much. Their influence is big because they are celebrity, but it will be to welcome him that it has a good influence. I want to support them who gave people of the world joy so that you say."
NBE04847,"I think it is nice British Royal Family's activity that called ""Noblesse oblige"" . Prince William and Princess Catherine are very popular in the world. So what they do is very important and has a great influence on people all over the world. I hope that they can help to improve relationships of many countries."
NBE04833,I agree with your opinion. They make many people happy. I respect them. I want to do so. I have a lot of things to learn from them.
NBE04856,"I saw happy news after a long time. They give us happiness, so I love them too. I want them to help restoration of diplomatic relations all of the world."
NBE04848,They are popular and famous all over the world. So they have a great influence on people all over the world. I believe that their visiting can improve relationship of many countries.
NBE04828,"In this article, what is important is the easiness. Article says drinking tea in daily life is good. They doesn't mention about how useful it is. I think his comment is way off the mark."
NBE04843,"I was interested in his comment. However, he said that he will drink tea only. I am worry about his health. And I want him to understand drinking too much tea is bad for your health. I want tell him that it is not good to be too in everything."
NBE04839,"I think so too! Their work is the most peaceful to cooperate nations without any interests. Their actions are likely to be mistaken for easy work. In this case, they received the message ""You want to see our city, but do you care about our problems?"". But I believe their actions make good relationship between british and other countries. I want them to continue this event too."
NBE04835,"It's a heart-warming news. Most of the news on this site seem to be very serious, so I was relieved, reading this article. I like them, and wonder when they will visit Japan."
NBE04836,Me too. I'm looking forward to seeing them.
NBE04837,"First, I knew this fact before Iread. second, three cups a day is not ""only"" for me."
NBE04846,"I am surprised at that so many classmates love Prince William and Catherine!! I also love them very much, too. Their marriage in 2011 was social event on a global scale. Of course, I watched the marriage ceremony on TV. I want Japanese Imperial Household to be loved many people in the world like them. If they have the second baby, I hope their visit to Tokyo with their children. Their visit to countries will make the relationship between the countries better, I think."
NBE04832,"The royal couples are known around the world. Maybe, a lot of people love them. I am one of them. This couple has power to make people be happy. I think they can help to improve relationships of many countries."
NBE04831,"I think so, too. This news make us calm. I hope they come to Japan!"
NBE04852,"I approve your opinion, too. Behavior of a royal family can have a good impression very much. I'm interested in continuation of an exchange with non-royal family."
NBE04841,"I like this news and the British royal couple. They are very famous all over the world and have a great influence of action. For the peace of the world, I want their couple to visit all over the world and contribute to the peace."
NBE04930,"I did not know this news, but knew that Sony received a cyber attack. It is very scary that such a thing happens by a cyber attack. This is because it does not know when one's information is aimed at. The life became convenient by the development of the information technology, but it must be understood that the danger increased at the same time. Furthermore, this problem is difficult because this problem develop into a diplomatic problem."
NBE04921,"Such a movie about person like a national symbol killed can't avoid arousing the national hostility. If the film makers would like to tell people something , take the chance to tell it. This is so difficult problem between freedom of expression and human right. Thinking about the human right, movies have tremendous impact on people around the worlds. The person's image is likely to change. However freedom of expression is also important for everyone. As we think about the problem, we should be carefully. If the problem cause a bad relation between US and North Korea, a influence about a cyber attack and terrorism spread throughout the world. I scared the spreading terrorism. I understand Jimmy Kimmel's opinion. In my opinion about dealing with the problem, to postpone the movie is better to avoid the worst possible. And we need to think about the measures in order to avoid withering some film makers making movies freely."
NBE04872,"I heard that there are a film which ridicules North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. It is true that this film is a comedy. However, I think that its filmmakers knew their film could arouse criticism because it could arouse strong public sentiment. I think that all that was taken into consideration. It must be a publicity stunt. We have to be careful in order not to be influenced by uncertain information."
NBE04869,"I think North Korea's cyber attack is infringe free expression, but I have a doubt that describe an assassination about real existence people, like Kim Jong-Un, in the movie. We have the right of free expression, but we should be careful when we treat real existence people and consider their human rights."
NBE04871,"I felt the same way after I read this article. We live in a modern and civilized country and we do not have any sense of danger about a cyber attack. Though we reap a benefit from the information technology, we do not gain an understanding of the mechanism of it. You're never too old to learn. We have to know how to protect ourselves."
NBE04958,"I'm surprised that Sony Pictures has canceled the planned US release on 25 December of the film The Interview, after major cinema chains decided not to screen it because of the hacker group's cyber attack. It means Sony's right to free expression was infringed. It is inadmissible incident."
NBE04882,"I didn't know about this news before reading this article. When I found the news, I was very surprised and shocked. In my opinion, it's a bad behavior to express our feelings by hacking because if everyone does the same thing, nobody can't make movies or something related to society. As for this case, I feel very sorry for those who made the film because I think they were looking forward to release of the film. Anyway, it's true that our life became very convenient by computer technology, but there must be danger like hacking. Therefore, we should reconsider how to handle computers."
NBE04945,"I knew that the movie was created before I heard this news for the first time. I was anxious that the North Korea would be angry for the movie released because it is too indiscreet that the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-Un would be planted to assassinate. This news is full of fear. On the other hand, there is freedom of expression, so it is also regretful that the movie cannot be shown."
NBE04944,"I knew this news but i didn't know and be surprised the company received cyber attack is Sony. I feel very sorry for those who made the film looking forward to release of the film. Today, the technology was improved and our life became very convenient. But it means we all have the risk of technology attack like hacking. We should know the countermeasure and use technologies safely."
NBE04890,"I doubt the wisdom of threating a cinema company for a complaint about the contents of the film. Certainly it seems that the contents that the First Secretary's assassination picks a fight to North Korea. America shouldn't make such film and North Korea had better only stop screening in the interior without cyber attack. It's very hard not to make worse the relationship to North Korea, but America must devise a strategy for breaking out of the problem."
NBE04891,It is right that we have to be careful then. I think that coexist with freedom of expression and how to express is very involved and difficult problem. America hadn't better express as inflaming anger of North Korea and North Korea shouldn't do cyber attack.
NBE04881,"I agree with you and I also think that the balance between freedom of expression and human right is very difficult so we have to treat the problem carefully. I think this kind of thing could happen because of the different impressions toward one person. It is natural for everyone to have various opinions and it is very important to express them freely. This makes the problem very difficult. In my opinion, I feel sorry for film makers because I understand they worked very hard to complete the film. Considering about the worst case that relationship between US and North Korea would become worse and worse and terrorism spread throughout the world, to postpone the movie is better to avoid the situation. However, as you said, I want film makers to produce more and more interesting movies, but this is impossible if they don't have right to express ideas freely. Therefore, we need to think about the measures in order to avoid withering some film makers immediately."
NBE04874,"I was very surprised and felt proud to be Japanese to read this article. It is very famous that life expectancy of Japanese is very long, both men and women, and I began to think that this may be attributed to the custom of drinking tea of Japanese. In other countries, especially in the U. S, most people like soft drinks, for example Pepsi, Coca-Cola, and Sprite. . . and so on and this means their lifestyle of eating is bad and we can understand the reason why life expectancy of American is not so long. I hope more good effects of tea will be discovered in the future."
NBE04875,"I can understand the reaction of SONY because people of North Korea often do something strange we've never expected and their thought is dangerous. However, I think the content of the movie is improper to release in public. The theme of this movie is assassination of the President of the nation and it is not good to be the theme of movie when we think about the relation between the U. S and North Korea in the future. Although it is true that action of North Korea is insane and sometimes harmful to other countries, we shouldn't activate that ""mad"" nation one-sidedly."
NBE04904,"I believe in the right of expression. So whether SONY do so or not is SONY's free. It has nothing to do with North Korean people or hackers. But I understand the feeling of North Korean. If the theme of the movie were not Kim Jong-Un, our prime minister Sinzo Abe, we would not like it."
NBE04873,"I strongly agree with your opinion. Drinking tea almost everyday is one of Japanese unique tradition and this is why Japanese is famous for their long life expectancy, I think. Therefore, it's very important for us Japanese to be proud of our custom and to cherish our custom and to maintain our custom."
NBE04876,"I think so too. Of course cyber terrorism by North Korea is bad without question, but in the very beginning, the theme of the movie is improper. That movie is quite provocative and clear to make North Korea feel uncomfortable. Therefore, SONY pictures shouldn't have made that movie, I think."
NBE04946,"I really agree with you. It is true that we have the right to be free about expression, this case is too lacking morality. We hav to be careful and refrain from expressing the death of real person even if we have the right to express it."
NBE04877,"After I read this article, I was very surprised that three or four cups of tea can decease the incidence of diseases. I can't imagine that tea can work like that. According to tea can replaces fluids and contains antioxidants, and it is good for our health. So, I think I have to drink four cups of tea every day in the future. And I also feel this study is very interesting. I wonder why researchers want to look into this thing or what make them research this. Drinking a cup of tea is something routine of our life. I don't care about what will drinking tea make us. What I want to say is interesting research is around our life. I could see it in a new light because of this article."
NBE04863,"This is a very difficult issue, I think. Certainly, I recognize the justice of North Korean people's anger. But, I think that North Korean lodged a protest over this movie in an inappropriate way. This way leads to an attack on freedom of expression. We need to be achieved an appropriate balance between freedom of expression and honor."
NBE04862,"I can take your opinion. But, I can't flatly fault filmmakers. I think that movie producer has a key role as sender of the political information. Of course, they mustn't damage someone's reputation. But, politician should take a certain amount of criticism. We need to be achieved an appropriate balance between freedom of expression and honor."
NBE04928,"I'm interested in this news and knew the fact of the cyber attack. It is true that cyber attack is the despicable way and should not be admitted. But , looking back, Sony, the worldwide company, also done the disgraceful thing. i. e. they made the shameful movie that makes fun of the leader of the country. They have to reconsider of their attitude and if it is possible, they should apologize. That sincere attitude will make the relationship better."
NBE04897,"I didn't know this news until I read it. This news made me scare. I think, Sony pictures and major cinema chains's decision not to screen is right. Terrorists are capable of anything. If this movie is actually release, they act terrorism undoubtedly. I have been scared of North Korean. It is certain that this threat is related to it. I hope that Japan will not involved."
NBE04898,"I was interested in your comment!! When I read this article, I felt a strong loathing for only North Korea. However, as you mentioned, we should be careful when we treat real existence people. It is not until I read your comment that I thought that Sony pictures also had responsibility."
NBE04918,"Through this matter, there are two rights to be considered, the freedom of expression and human rights. The freedom of expression was violated by having been attacked cyber terrorism. In contrast, Kim Jong-Un might have been infringed his human right. However, in my opinion, this picture has the chance to make a lot of people understand North Korea should be changed instantly. And I hope that many abductees would be helped by this movie."
NBE04917,I agree with you. It is not admissible incident to infringe the right to free expression. The hacker group's cyber attack must not be allowed.
NBE04916,"I agree with you. I like drinking tea more than water. Also, I would like to spend my life healthily without any illness. Thus I would like to know more and more about food."
NBE04919,"The reason why agree with this opinion is I have the same opinion as this. I like drinking tea more than water. Also, I would like to spend my life healthily without any illness. Thus I would like to know more and more about food."
NBE04920,"I agree with your opinion about the move's influence . I think the movie's content , especially an assassinate of North Korea leader, injured his and the nation's pride and feelings. And the movie may violate human rights. Furthermore I think the content make people watching it bad feeling. Thinking these point as you said and safety of the world , a judgment about postponement of it is good. Although the news is bad, I think we can get the chance to collect information about North Korea and to talk with North Korea. We have little information about the country of domestic administration. I hope a relation to the country is better little by little."
NBE04929,"I agree with your opinion. Your idea is good. I want to tell a lot of people about North Korea. Since this movie is able to see at America after all, so many people would come to have an opinion about North Korea. I want to see this movie."
NBE04937,"About this problem, I think that it should be criticized. It is a clear fact not to have to hack. However, I think that the act hacking between a country and countries of North Korea is not a permissible thing. There are various opinions, but I think that it is appropriate and the correspondence of Sony. I think that such a thing should give response that it is severe all over the world to never get up."
NBE04948,"I didn't know about this news before reading this article. And after read this article, I was very surprised and shocked. I think it's a bad behavior to express our feelings by hacking because if everyone does the same thing, nobody can't make movies or something related to society. It's true that our life became very convenient by computer technology, but there must be danger like hacking. we have to care about it."
NBE04947,I agree with you. I think the hacker group's cyber attack must not be allowed too.
NBE04953,"Even if North Korean people feel unpleasant to this movie, hacking is inadmissible act. Stealing data and e-mails is obviously criminal act. I think freedom of expression should be protected in this problem. This must not becoming start of destroying movies."
NBE04957,"I knew about this news before I read this article. When I saw the news about this movie and cyber attack on Sony for the first time, I felt so surprised! First, I was surprised at the content of this movie. I can't understand why Sony Pictures and USA purposely made the movie whose content challenge North Korea and make it angry. And I felt fear to hear that North Korea sent the mail which implicate the terror like 9.11. Moreover, the movie was released eventually. I can't understand!"
NBE04956,"I felt fear to know about this movie ""The Interview"", too. You said "" It is also regretful that the movie cannot be shown. "" However, I didn't think so. The movie was released eventually, you know? I can't understand why Sony Pictures and USA released it this timing. They made North Korea angry by this action definitely, I think."
NBE04959,"Your opinion, "" I have a doubt that describe an assassination about real existence people, like Kim Jong-Un, in the movie. "" is right reaction. After reading this article, I got angry with North Korea's infringement on people's free expression rights. However it is natural that North Korean got angry with the movie, because its content is assassination of Kim Jong-Un. I should have wider point of view."
NBE04914,"I don't know what is the best choice, but the judgment Sony made doesn't seem to bad one. Right to free expression is surely important, but the safety for people is more important."
NBE04915,I hope so. I will be sad if I can't watch various kinds of movies.
NBE04951,"I heard this news many times and I'm interested in this news. Some people exclaim the freedom of expression, others say it is the most important thing to keep peaceful condition. I think that is very difficult problem because America and North Korea have deep history. However, I wish something scared won't happen about this movie."
NBE04923,"I have had from very interested previously for this news. The first such movie in the beginning I was surprised that SONY is made. There is no reason that North Korea is making this movie does not come to attack. And interesting, even for the United States has evolved in international issues and intervention against this. This movie anyway aired. Movie Thanks to this news became very popular. This thing SONY in anticipation, and I do not know anyone whether was making this movie."
NBE04952,"I partly agree with your opinion. I think this problem is between freedom of expression and human rights , too. I wish many people will know North Korea problem after this incident."
NBE04922,"I agree with you to some extent. As you say, the movie which SONY made is too politic and has too direct expression to release. With this incident, I think that SONY could expect such a situation. Anyway, each country should calm down."
NBE04896,"I heard this news many times and I'm interested in this news. Some people exclaim the freedom of expression, others say it is the most important thing to keep peaceful relationship between countries. I don't know the best choice, but the judgment of Sony doesn't bad choice."
NBE04895,I agree with you. cyber attack group should be arrested. And we should make law strict for new crime used internet.
NBE04883,"I think many people focus on the problem of freedom of expression. In these days we have to respect the right and try to do our best. However, I think there is another problem. I can't believe that Noarth Korea did cyber attack because the nation didn't have such a high technique. Even the upper in that country can't use Internet and have access to it. So who made this situation? Only God knows"
NBE04938,"I agree your opinion to think that this problem is a very difficult problem. I think that there are each other's claims. So it is very difficult to determine simply which way is bad. However, it is the act that you must not permit if it is a fact that North Korea violated freedom of expression. We listen to each other's opinions, and I think that it is necessary to make an appropriate decision."
NBE04936,"I did not know this incident before I read this article. First, I was surprised at the content of The interview. It is dangerous to make the story that Kim Jong-Un is assassinated. I think South Korean people will get angry with this movie after they notice the content. So I also guess that hackers in South Korean carried out the cyber attacks. By the way, it is bad to carry out a cyber attack, however, it is not also good to make a fool of other country's president."
NBE04935,"I agree with you! If I were South Korean people, I would also have bad feelings. So even though we have the rights to express freely, we have to care about other people."
NBE04924,"I agree with you to some extent. As you say, the movie which SONY made is too politic and has too direct expression to release. With this incident, I think that SONY could expect such a situation. Anyway, each country should calm down"
NBE04906,"I think so too. Our life became very convenient . However, fears and stress also increased. Maybe we must think better our society."
NBE04905,"I knew Sony was hacked , but didn't know postponed the release of a movie. All humans have right to free expression. However I don't think such movie should be admired. Such movies may make someone uncomfortable. We need take many outcome into consideration."
NBE04954,That's right. The most important thing is not to occur conflict between America and North Korea. Peace should be kept absolutely.
NBE04955,"Certainly, the contents of the movie are including uncomfortable describe. But cyberattack is still crime, so I can't forgive the action of North Korean."
NBE04943,"I agree to your opinion. Today, the technology was improved and our life became very convenient. But it means we all have the risk of technology attack like hacking. We should know the countermeasure and use technologies safely."
NBE04884,"Your opinion is very interesting. The movie will make someone uncomfortable should not be broadcast. Movie should be a entertainment, not a irony or sarcasm."
NBE04934,"When I read this article, I was surprised at Sony Pictures has canceled the planned US release. I think that it is so difficult problem of freedom of expression. The incident that the major cinema chains stop screening the movie means Sony's right to freedom of expression was infringed. However, when I think about it positively, it is a chance to spread the problem about abduction issue all over the world. Therefore, I believe that many abductees would be helped by this movie."
NBE04933,"I agree with your opinion. When I think about this incident positively, it is chance to make a lot of people understand abduction issue. I hope so too."
NBE05028,"This comment is objective and positive. She can consider from both standpoints. It means she can think about this issue on an equal footing. And her comment is similar to my comment. Therefore, I can understand what she want to say."
NBE04868,"North Korea's cyber attack will seriously threaten the security of this country. We now depend on latest IT technology and_it makes my life comfortable. but, cyber attack cross the border and does huge damage with ease. However, it is not fair to claim the political insistence. That must constitute other country's invasion. Although this problem gathered people's attentions ironically, we must more pay attention to our rights."
NBE04867,"North Korea's cyber attack will seriously threaten the security of this country. We now depend on latest IT technology and it makes my life comfortable. but, cyber attack cross the border and does huge damage with ease. However, it is not fair to claim the political insistence. That must constitute other country's invasion. Although this problem gathered people's attentions ironically, we must more pay attention to our rights."
NBE04927,I think this fuck shouldn't be forgive regardless of any reasons because this is an invasion of free expression. And the film is about a fictional plot to kill North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. But I think it is going too far in killing specific person who really exists.
NBE04908,"When I read the article, I thought Sony Entertainment pictures also have faults. Certainly, hacking is an unacceptable action, and it is disgusting to intimidate cinemas into canceling to screen it. Moreover, it is true that North Korea itself and its social system should be to blame because the dictatorship makes people in North Korea suffering, starving and poor. So I can understand some journalists and reporters would be driven by righteous indignation in order to emancipate and enlighten suffering people. However, just because North Korea is like an evil axis and their ways are meanness, it doesn't follow that it justify to make them funny. Therefore, think canceling to screen it is a nice decision."
NBE04886,"I watched this news on television. Then American people said that it was not a good idea and it meant buckle under pressure of North Korea, which is a very little country. I think hacking is a dissolute active and provocation behavior in America is also misconduct. The relationship between Japan and North Korea is not satisfactory. We should deal with the problem of this country patiently."
NBE04913,"This article is not surprising and pleasant for me, because I know it and I rarely drink tea. I drink juice more than tea, so I want to know what juice is delicious and healthy."
NBE04926,"I agree with you. Of course North Korea's cyber attack should be criticized, but the movie also went too far. Even if the movie is a comedy, it is wrong to give someone specific discomfort. So I also think we should be careful when we treat real existence people and consider their human rights."
NBE04911,"I like tea more than water too. However I like juice more than tea,"
NBE04912,Really!? I missed to read that part. Thank you for telling.
NBE04885,"I think so, too. The distance between Japan and North Korea is very close. I do not understand what people in North Korea think, so I just hope nothing happens."
NBE04942,"I did not know this news. However, when I read this news, I was so scare, and considered the situation that we are now living with internet technology. The development of the internet technology has made our lives convenient. However, also we have been open to danger like this by the convenience. The outflow of our personal information can occur. We should care the danger of the cyber attack more."
NBE04910,"When I finished reading this article, I was very surprised. Previously I saw this incident in TV. I think North Korea should be unwatchable. It is understood to be a provocation definitely of that to the top of the government to jokes. It is bad that North Korea do a cyber attack, but picture is also bad. Action should be a careful I think."
NBE04900,"I heard this news on TV too. If I were an audience for the movie, I would gave up watching the movie after a threat and hacking news because I do not want to watch it exposing me danger. But I am so interesting in the movie because I can learn South Korean history or the original state watching it. I want to watch it someday."
NBE04902,"When I watched this news on the Internet, I think this is a difficult problem. Actually, It is impermissible to invade freedom of expression, and we can express anything freely. However, I think we must not produce films like the film that becomes a problem if we want to build a good relationship with North Korea. We cannot have a good relationship without respecting each other. If we can build a good relationship with North Korea, we would progress toward peace. So, we should consider what we should do to solve this difficult problem."
NBE04899,"I agree with your opinion. I think that sony should not release the movie at first, but we should protect freedom of expression, so sony should release it with special guard of audiences."
NBE04941,"I agree with especially your comment ""We have the right of free expression, but we should be careful when we treat real existence people and consider their human rights. "" I think it is difficult and sensitive problem. It is natural that we have different opinions, so to criticize another opinion is good case by case. However, when ""criticize"" changes ""slander"", it is no worth and can hurt the human rights."
NBE04909,"I strongly agree with your opinion. Even if it is a comedy, It is unpleasant When viewed from the North Korean side. We should do before thinking."
NBE04940,"The first time when I heard the news, I felt very unpleasant. Of course the freedom of expression should be valued, however, is it pleasant to see that our leader (who lives now!) was killed? Especially, most North Korean people respects their leader deeply, and the creator of the film must have know that. So, it was natural to predict that they would oppose the film. I think the problem of diplomacy is very sensitive, so the creators should have taken it consideration enough."
NBE04939,"I partly agree with your opinion, but I also want to take North Korean people's mind into consideration. I think if our leader who exists will killed in a film of other country, we will not feel pleasant. I think they didn't need to make such a harsh work."
NBE04901,"I was surprised to read this article. I think North Korea's cyber attack is infringe free expression. There should be free expression. If North Korea wants to criticize sony , they have to use not cyber attack but a note of protest for sony not to release. I think North Korea took wrong way."
NBE04903,"I agree with you. , the freedom of expression and human rights are to be considered. I wish this matter don't lead to fireworks between countries."
NBE04892,There was an avenge by the US after this incident. North Korea had a time with no internet connection. The battle in the cyberspace is on the rise. I made my mind to study more about IT.
NBE04878,"This is very interesting problem. When someone made film such as this article, it would arise national problem. However, this time, United States of America is guaranteeing people's free of expression. What would happen in this case? I want to know about what will happen in this case."
NBE04879,"You are right. I completely agree with you. Like Japan and North Korea, relation between U. S. and North Korea isn't good. So, I think US should act more carefully."
NBE04880,"I don't know why she drink tea until she doesn't like it. We aren't forced to do it. So, I think we should do what we want."
NBE04925,"I didn't know this SONY's problem. It is clear that cyber terrorism by North Korea infringe on the freedom of expression. Of course security of people is important, but the US government should do something to North Korea by political measures . I think."
NBE04907,"I agree with your supplementary opinion. Of course, if national leader who have been in the post is insulted by another country's film, maybe the national people feel bad. Moreover, I wonder the North Korean hacker did it against their will. As you know, North Korea was under the dictatorship of Kim Jong-Un, so there is a high likelihood that Kim Jong-Un or admirals in the army forced IT engineers to do so. Therefore, I think there are mitigating circumstances for the blamed."
NBE04866,"I think so too. Although Internet is necessary thing for us to live, one misstep in using that, it could do huge damage to us. We more take care of that."
NBE04949,"I know this news. This movie can't have been broadcast. I think this decision is right. If this movie were televised, terrorism would happen, and many people in theaters would be victims. Nevertheless, I want to see the this movie."
NBE04864,I agree with you. Both are to blame in the way of protest depiction. Giving thought to each other makes lead to make the livable world.
NBE04950,"I think so, too. Freedom of expression is surely important, but , by this freedom, many people will be at the risk of terrorism. I hope nothing happen from today about this movie."
NBE04870,"I'm interested in your opinion. Movie producers mustn't damage someone's reputation, however, politician should have capacity which take a certain amount of criticism."
NBE04931,"It is said that the society can be measured by humor. So that means North Korea is low level society. In the other hand, this case , however, is attack against the freedom of speech. We must overcome the terrorism! We should ask Sony to release the movie!"
NBE04932,"Your opinion is very interesting. Actually we need the balance between the freedom and the human rights. However, propaganda movies always exist. We need to understand while we watch the propaganda."
NBE04865,"N. Korea's hacking on Sony Pictures is something that should not be forgiven. Freedom of speech was violated by forcefully canceling the screening of the movie. However, Sony also depicted the murder of a character modeled on an existing figure. Does this fit in to the range of humor? We must re-consider from this incident, and the recent Charlie Hebdo terrorism case, that there is a certain line between speech and humor, and, respect to religion and international politics."
NBE04887,"Actually, this movie make North Korean people unhappy, However, their action was not allowed. Their action denied rights of free expression."
NBE04888,I agree with you and I want to watch this movie too.
NBE04889,I believe this movie should not be released.
NBE04894,"When I heard this news, I was surprised at Sony receiving cyber attack. And I think it is very important problem of expression freedom versus human right. I can't conclude this problem but I want such a incentive movie to be released more."
NBE04893,I agree with you. Free expression and human right are very important and both of them should be respected.
NBE04961,"I think the Abe Administration does not understand the value of the constitution. The purpose of the constitution is to bind the government authority. So, all policy-makers must follow constitution. Though, for example, Abe Administration is going to infringe the freedom of expression with the secrets law. We must learn the value of freedom and right. Abe surely have won the election, but he must not forget that constitution exists for protecting the right of minority."
NBE04998,"I think that I want Prime Minister Abe to review a constitution carefully. He thinks that he got the support of the nation by having won for election, and a one's thought street may surely act. However, he must not forget that there are the people of the opposition either. There are a lot of people of the opposition about the constitutional revision. It was a fact to have won in this election, but did not get support of the whole nation in it. I want him to examine it carefully for even slightly many nations to become useful."
NBE04997,"I am concerned about possibilities of misunderstanding of Prime Minister Abe. His election this time ended in a landslide victory for him, so we tend to misunderstand it as if all Japanese people support him. However his party could not obtain a majority of votes. Therefore I would like him to deal with political problems carefully, especially Japan's pacifist constitution and relation to China."
NBE04968,I think PM should propose the new article 9 as soon as possible. Chinese government officials and the press of the Communist party said they will invade East China Sea and Pacific Ocean. Obama is reducing the army. So US cannot take part of maintaining the security East Asia. So Japan should do and oppose with imperialism of China. In fact they invaded and rule East Turkistan and Tibet even now. They support Pro-Chinese in Okinawa and want to make the island the part of Chinese. We cannot ignore Chinese invasion.
NBE04977,"The Abe administration should advance the constitutional amendment while considering more carefully though there is a strong movement under way to carry out it. The constitutional amendment has only enforced once and it is a change from Meiji Constitution to the present constitution. By having the right of collective self-defense and preparing to use armed force in Japan, it has a great influence on other countries. If Japan don't think about having military force while deliberating on a relationship to countries which live in a state of tension."
NBE04976,"I agree with your comment. If there is a strong movement under way to carry out it, some opposes his plan and great confusion will prevail throughout the country."
NBE04978,The opinion has a lack of balance. I think the conclusion of the Abe Administration is inevitable though Mr. Abe is a rightist because it is undeniable to have military force for Japan to get along with other countries.
NBE05002,"I think that Prime Minister Abe should think about a little constitutional importance. To change the constitution may be connected in changing Japan in itself because it continued being the Japanese Supreme Standard of Laws after a war. Japan must surely consider about constitution Article 9 again while there is the menace of neighboring countries such as China or North Korea. However, the Abe Administration does not change a constitution easily and must push forward a story in consideration of the public opinion of the nation."
NBE05005,"I think that Abe is a good politician and the Prime Minister because he has a strong faith and behaves in accordance with his faith. However, I think he must be calm and pay attention to opinions of countries around Japan. Now, the relationships of Japan and neighbor Asian countries have gone cold turned cold. It just arouses their hostility for Abe to persist in his opinion in this conditions. He should consider opinions of other countries and carry out politics wisely."
NBE04972,"I think this is the most important problem in Japan nowadays. Prime minister Shinzo Abe was re-elected by public and hs said that this re-election means Japan have to rewrite the country's pacifist constitution. However, according to some newspaper's research, though the Liberal Democratic Party win a majority, people who support to rewrite the constitution is a lesser proportion. It is strange story, isn't it? This research means a lot of thing, for example, there are no reliable party, and also may mean interest groups power are being stronger. Can this say that this time's referendum shoe the will of the people? I don't think so. I want to keep studying these political problems."
NBE04971,"I agree with you. Prime minister and there colleagues must consider this problem. This is very important, so they shouldn't be hurry to get conclusion."
NBE04987,"As we know, Mr. Abe have long shown his biggest desire to change the current constitution, which is a symbol of post-war era, that is to say, the international situation that restricts Japan's bold and free action in terms of territorial, economical, social issues. And then most of citizens voted the LDP, so in a way this action can be viewed as ""a consensus"". However, we should not allow him just to proceed. In speech, we can say opinion against the policy. This way, we can make the administration consider carefully whether to enforce it."
NBE04960,I agree with you. Major issues in this election are economic policies. People is none too sure of constitutional change. Abe should forges better relations with neighboring countries and considers the idea of Article 9.
NBE04988,"You have a very good viewpoint and I respect your attitude. In my opinion, the seemingly contradictory situation - where those who support the LDP do not necessarily stand for changing the constitution - comes from the reality that the majority of Japanese people are being ""voting machine"" in some way. I mean, there are many people who vote but do not have interests in politics. They vote without deep consideration, often haunted by disappointment at Japan's current political situation. I believe that, in today's democratic society, citizen's spontaneous actions like demo and speech are crucial. So, to begin with, WE should change our attitude and consciousness toward politics, eventually enabling democracy to function. That is what I have in mind."
NBE04962,"I think that he understand the essence of constitution. Constitution exists for protecting the right of minority. So, Abe changes the constitution without hesitation only because won the election. Abe discusses carefully whether to change constitution."
NBE05026,"This comment of his or her has very sharp consideration and poses questions to the current political situation that can be conjectured in the article. And I also try to have such critical and positive attitude, so I greatly sympathized with him or her."
NBE04984,"This news has so important problem for Japanese, also for world countries. I think Mr. Abe is good prime minister, I trust him. However, I can't agree with revising the constitution completely. Firstly, I can't understand his aim clearly. I'd like him to go ahead discreetly."
NBE04996,"In the first place, we did not expect the election. We want the government to take action positively. I was anxious about revising constitutions. In particular, the prime minister Abe try to change the interpretation of Article 9 which is a symbol of peace constitution. Finally, his desiring was to allow Japan to exercise the right to collective self-defense. I think that he should have explained us about its merit and demerit more detail. It is most important for the current government to listen a national opinion. Japanese constitution is established by tradition and history. Therefore, we have to be more careful when we consider the constitution in the future."
NBE04983,"This news has so important problem for Japanese. We must learn the value of freedom and right. Abe surely have won the election, but he must not forget that constitution exists for protecting the right of minority. We should consider the problem carefully."
NBE04982,I agree with you. Important problem in this election is economic policy. Few of people think constitutional change.
NBE04969,"Article 9 of the current Japanese constitution rejects acts of war and weapons of war. Japan is one of the few countries whose constitution renounces war. I think it is natural to protect our own country from a threat from a neighboring country. Japan has been peaceful since the end of the Second world War under the constitution because we have been under the umbrella of the US . Meanwhile, a lot of people support Article 9. They love peace and claim that Japan should convey to the world how terrible war is and how precious peace is as the nation hit with a nuclear bomb. I am able to understand what they say. However, I believe that Japan should be more independent. That's why Japan is criticized for being subjugated by US ."
NBE04970,"I am able to understand what you said. However, I disagree with you. Currently, the far east is smoldering because North Korea tested missiles and nuclear weapons. I think that it is just because of the strict observance of the constitution that peace has been kept since the end of the Second World War. However, the present international situation is dangerous. This is a time of decision"
NBE04995,I think so too. I expect his ability to take action. I cannot understand his goal of revising the constitution. It is important to explain us more detail.
NBE04973,"Changing constitution is not considered carelessly. As a matter of fact, Japan has been kept peace on the basis of this constitution. I oppose to the right of collective self-defense because this right means taking part in wars in the other countries positively. The prime minister Abe just wants to do great program remembered by later generations. There are few people who experienced World War II, so now is the very time when we reconsider the importance of peace and the effort of Japan so far."
NBE04974,"I agree with you. The prime minister Abe play a good role about economy, but he has scant thinking of history. I think this constitution, which we have been followed, should be kept."
NBE04975,"I strongly believe that we should not change the constitution. Wars do not produce something happy. On the other hand, they just bring misfortune. I have no experience of wars, but I was told how terrible they are by my grandfather. I am satisfied the original condition of Japan. We should avoid exposing to danger."
NBE04999,"I doubt the Prime Minister truly understands the purpose of Japanese constitution. The original purpose of it is to restrict leaders' authorities. If he change the constitution without understanding it, I think it is very dangerous. In addition, I oppose changing the constitution. I am proud of our constitution which refers to ""peace"", and I hope this idea spreads and influences all over the world. It will be the model of the world, so I think we should search for the other ways to keep our global position."
NBE04986,"I don't understand why is this election hold. Abe is very smart in this point. In this situation, it is clear that Abe will win this election. If Abe win this election, he will able to continue to do longer than now. He thinks that he got the support of the nation by having won for election. But I think it is not the support of the nation."
NBE04985,"I agree with you. Abe surely have won the election, but he must not forget that constitution exists for protecting the right of minority."
NBE05000,"I'm opposite to your opinion, too. He has a mind to make Japan go to the war. Japan has a wonderful constitution as a peaceful constitution. That's Japanese pride and I think the wisdom which arrived by the history with the long mankind. The person who doesn't look back to the past has no futures. Before our country amends the constitution and has military, reflection in the past should be reconsidered again."
NBE05001,I'm not supporting Prime Minister Abe. Only distrust is held in how to advance it his dictatorial politics. The same atmosphere as before the Second World War is because there is current state which has happened.
NBE04967,"I think now is the time to rethink our constitution. We should prepare to make sure our national security. The situation of East Asia is at risk. Because Japanese economical power is strong, the only country which can deal with China and Korea. We cannot ignore their presence and imperialism."
NBE05003,"I think Abe's policy is anachronistic. As other countries say, Abe should learn from history. Although we don't have military, and face a crisis from North Korea and so on, Japanese people remember WWII. That war leave scars to many people. Abe should reconsider this condition. All the Japanese people also should consider our own position."
NBE05004,"I think so, too. Abe won the election, but he must not forget the purpose of democracy. We should go to the election to vote if criticize his policy."
NBE04963,"I am also anxious about revising constitution. And we should consider more carefully and make a big deal of it. However, I think it is not because the constitution was established by tradition and history but because the constitution exists for the sake of prevention of national runaway."
NBE04992,"I think we should discuss whether the constitution would be changed or remained. I think it should be changed because the environment has changed. The constitution is old fashioned. And, the new constitution by L. D. P. is better than present one. It is enough to change it. We should improve the constitution and the country!"
NBE04993,Wait a minute. Many constitutions around the world say the pacifism and also new constitution will show the same idea. We can never change anything if you say what we do not change means peace.
NBE04994,Because she thinks peace is only kept by words but I do not think so. the world is more complicated than pacifist know.
NBE04964,"The Liberal Democratic Party of Japan enjoyed a landslide victory because they brought up the economic policy as the main issue. However, Prime Minister Abe's real intentions were to amend the Japanese constitution. He does not even understand the purpose of the Constitution, and just wants to rewrite it the way he wants it to be. The Constitution is supposed to protect the people by limiting the powers of the Government. If the Constitution is re-written into something convenient for the Government, the Government will go out of control. We must watch his moves carefully."
NBE04965,I agree because I also think Mr. Abe doesn't understand Japanese constitution. The Constitution is supposed to protect the people by limiting the powers of the Government. He doesn't know that. Nevertheless he start to ready to change the constitution. This is serious problem.
NBE04966,The constitution should not be changed because of its tradition and history but because it is supposed to protect the people by limiting the powers of the Government.
NBE04990,"I think we are short of opportunities of discussion. We should discuss more and more. Japanese government should explain this matter in detail and more times. we, including me should understand this matter in detail. Now I think Japanese people is the lack of understanding."
NBE04989,I agree with you. This matter is so complex. We must learn Japanese constitution and think whether we agree or not agree with Abe carefully.
NBE04980,This problem is very important for us and we Japanese should be interested in and discuss it. I think the citizens' opinion is not fully reflected to politics now. It is very bad thing and maybe can be called crisis of democracy.
NBE04979,I agree with you. This problem affect foreign countries as well as Japan and it is not good action seen from them.
NBE04991,This comment is inconsistent. I think Mr. Abe has not carry changing Japanese constitution through yet. It will be decided whether Mr. Abe is good minister from now.
NBE04981,This person is not aware of danger this law include.
NBE05016,"When I read this news in Japanese newspaper, I was very shocked. This year Yousafzai Malala received Nobel Peace Price, and i thought we passed first step of settling peace in Pakistan. This brutal murder shows that my thought was wrong. Another news sources I read says that Pakistan Taliban caused it in revenge for Taliban cleaning operation. I think again that it is difficult for Pakistanis to live in peace and content."
NBE05012,I was shocked and felt so sad when I heard this news for the first time. I really pray for the young souls.
NBE05007,"As you said, I thought we could pass the first step of setting peace in Pakistan when I knew the fact that Yousafzai Malala received Nobel Peace Price on TV this year. Therefore, this article made me very sad and disappointed. In Japan, we don't hear about this kind of news so much, but as a student, I feel very scary when I imagine such things occurred at a school. Anyway, I really think that we all consider how we can do for those in Pakistan to live peacefully. I think the government should also make efforts to solve the problem."
NBE05017,"They want to be recognized that their attitude toward religion or religious practices. It is Pakistani Taliban movement purpose and motive of the war. If we can listen to their opinion, I believe that is a big step forward."
NBE05022,"This terrorism is most miserable and is one of cruel events. Even an innocent child was sacrifice. I'm really sad. Taliban which took up a child, quite, it'll be driven. Opposition of Pakistan government and Taliban continues lengthily. When Taliban attacks, a government is punished. When a government punishes, Taliban retaliates. This is repeated. But they're a woman and children to suffer among these. A child is innocent entirely. Why they do a cruel thing? I cannot understand."
NBE05021,"I'm same as you, too. I grieve for this problem's having occurred. It has almost become impossible to live the life relieved in Pakistan. There was terrorism in Paris the other day. The terrorism has caused the offensive of the mosque. And the Muslim who had no relation so far got angry. Dislike bears dislike this. And they'll feel dislike is wide. Before we can not be resolved any more, we have to behave. Don't ignore this tragedy."
NBE05015,I felt same with you after read this article. I think that we should consider how we can do for those in Pakistan to live peacefully especially children.
NBE05020,"I felt so sad when I have heard the terrible news. I have known how serious pakistan before the cruel accident was happened. then, , I got to know that I haven't understood about Pakistan anything for the first time. the state of affairs is so serious more than we think, we must try to aid to solve the problem. We must quit to only see Pakistan through the TV."
NBE05008,"I think in the war each side have their own justice, and we can't decide which is right. In this situation, Taliban has their own right. It is because which they attacked was military school. It means there are many enemies in future. However, I'm sure that they are in wrong. Children shouldn't be targeted."
NBE05010,"I was shocked to hear the news. In Japan peace is a matter of course and there is no need to think about wars or conflicts. However, that is not always the case in the world. Not only Pakistan but Palestine have many problems of bombs. One soccer player in Palestinian team said that soccer ground suffered an air raid and was burnt up. They play soccer with the fear of wars. We should think what we can do for these suffering countries."
NBE05009,"I felt sad, too. What I can do is only praying. I just wish the day will come when every country in the world becomes peace and everyone feels happy."
NBE05019,"It's said that a parent got up at the school civilian war worker's student plies for this event. We, Japanese is living a life irrelevant to terrorism. But these Pakistani students were also made a mark of terrorism mercilessly, and many students were killed. Our eye to people with a sense of values different from oneself who have happened in the far country is often quite indifferent. But I think the way of thinking should be changed because we who live in peaceful Japan don't take out this too unreasonable victim any more."
NBE05018,"I approve your opinion, too. Many children shouldn't permit this event which became sacrifice. I think attention of an international society is the key which doesn't cause the second event."
NBE05006,"Some days before, I saw two pictures which were uploaded on Facebook by Talha Munir Paracha, who could escape the assault for Pakistan's school, because of his oversleeping. There were two boys include Talha in the school ground, and there were four boys in same place in the other picture. Two Talha's friends had been died in the assault. These pictures made me shock and I think the public shouldn't be injured because they are blameless. Also government should keep under terrorists and protect the public. I hope such dreadful assaults are never happened in the future."
NBE05011,"Even though, children will be enemies, they should not attack children because children do not have sin. They are just born in enemies house."
NBE05014,"I feel terrorism is so violent, cruel and shocking behavior. The fear and damage is so big. So terrorism is effective means of war. To guard people from a menace of terrorism every country and the UN must take some measures. We will never yield to terrorism."
NBE05013,I agree with you. It is so sad that innocent children was sacrificed. Taliban should know terrorism is shameful action.
NBE06173,"Development of autonomous cars will make our life more comfortable. If we praticalize this technology, the number of car accidents and traffic fatalities will decrease. However, we will have one trouble. It is to increase driving without a license."
NBE07215,"Autonomous car was imaginary technology when I was a child. But now, the fantasy is realizing and we can see the car moving with AI through the Internet. Today's advance of technology is very fast and some people are enjoying such situation, but others are struggling to catch up with it. I think that to consider problems that this current of the times may cause is important today."
NBE06998,"This technology is very amazing. The number of fatalities will be decreased by this technology. But in other words, employment opportunities will be also decreased . Track driver, taxi driver, bus driver and etc will be not able to work. Therefore new employment must be given to them while this technology is introduced."
NBE06965,"When I read it, I was so excited because I watched autonomous cars in picture books or animation in my childhood. It is a dreamlike technology!! Most of the traffic accidents in the world are caused by not malfunction of cars but carelessness of people. Practical use of autonomous cars may change this situations. In addition, traffic jams can be eased, we can reduce consumption of the gasoline. However, we have some problems about autonomous cars, so we should examine them carefully."
NBE07463,"When I read the headline of this article for the first time, I was fearful about the spread of self-driving cars, because I think many problems will be found after they begin to be used. Certainly, autonomous cars may help to reduce traffic facilities, but if we really want to reduce traffic accidents, we have to utilize public transports, for example, trains and buses. They are safe, more economical, and environment-friendly. We are likely to be interested in the new scientific technique. However, we should give it more careful consideration."
NBE07299,"I think self-driving cars are worth of being put into practice in terms of a decrease in traffic accident and a relaxation of congestion. However, the cars may not work depending on the circumstances perfectly. This system without judgements by us can cause tragic accidents. In addition, this technology will deprive people who like to drive of pleasures of driving. So, I don't think self-driving cars should replace all human-driving cars."
NBE07332,"First, I did not have any images that Google is making a car, so felt a sense of incongruity with seeing the word Google with other names like Mercedes-Benz. After reading and trying to imagine the future written in this article, I am scared because worse things might happen. The scale of an accident is unpredictable. But at the same time, I understand how convenient it is. I hope the use of existing-driving cars and autonomous cars will properly be balanced."
NBE05229,"I think it is a good idea to use self-driving car because it has a lot of benefits such as declining traffic accident. But I don't want to use this car in the future. Although it has a lot of benefits, there is no prove that self-driving car run safely all the time. I fear that the car may run sometimes without consideration for other cars or pedestrians. Thus, I want to use existing car even if Google let the self-driving car into the market."
NBE05034,"I think it is really useful if the car move automatically, but I disagree with this opinion. If the big traffic accident happened between autonomous driving cars, nobody can be responsible and police cannot arrest anyone. It will make a lawless zone."
NBE05374,"I think the technology of self-driving cars is fantastic and people all over the world may be interested in this topic. Yet I have two questions. One is that traffic accidents will really decline in the future. Even if self-driving cars are correctly controlled by computer, computer power is not necessarily perfect. The other is that driving license is need or not. This is why I disagree self-driving plan."
NBE05199,"I think that self-driving is good idea , but I disagree to use the technology of autonomous driving too much. There are three reasons. First, if the car lose the energy to operate itself, it might be in danger situation. Second, there is no guarantee that self-driving cars will never cause accidents. Third, automotive cars occurs the difficulty of finding employment, because the drivers won't be in needs. To sum up, I suppose that there are several problems to use automobile cars."
NBE05301,I think self-driving car is a good invention but I would not completely agree with that we use self-driving cars in ordinary. I have heard that auto-pilot sometimes be a cause of plane accidents; Automatic pilot is hard to be cancel. So human pilot can't do best drive. I think it will happen in the case of self-driving car. Human assessment of situations is better than machine particularly in the exceptionally cases. I command people's driving. Now we have not to up to machine and rethink about human's faculty.
NBE06813,"I am very excited to read the article and I am looking forward to autonomous driving coming. If autonomous cars can be used , our life will be rich and we don't have to have driving license. However there are some problems. According to the article , we has not secured their safety yet, so traffic accidents can happen like now. Also, we need make a new law about them because traffic system will change. When we trust in their safety, we would like to utilize them positively."
NBE06721,"Self-driving cars are interesting and very useful. If we can use these cars, we will be able to drive with no driving license. This article said that self-driving cars are going to save millions of lives. However, I think they will have as many accidents as now because they can't do depending on the circumstances. So, when we use self-driving cars, we have to be more carefully to drive all the time. I think we will also have to get driving license to drive the cars in the future."
NBE05165,"At first, I was surprised that self-driving vehicles would spread around the world in the near future. Also, I didn't know that Google contributes the society of autonomous vehicles. To my surprise, the technology is not dream but reality so I think that it is not far away that we can go to space easily and cars can fly. I realized that one original action of a corporation can move world's market. In addition, I was shocked that traffic accidents kill more one million people a year. Self-driving cars will not only make our lives very convenient but also save them so I wish the immediately expanding of self-driving cars."
NBE05391,"When I read this article, I was surprised because I have thought that Google was the company of computers. If autonomous cars become the mainstream of automobile industry, the number of unexpected accidents will reduce and we can go everywhere without driver's license. However, I think it is not good to rely on the machine too much. If autonomous cars prevail in the world, we should be careful of accident while driving. And also, I have a question. If we can utilize autonomous cars without driver's license, can children drive autonomous cars? I think autonomous cars have many benefits, but they also have many problems. I would like to expect more advances of automobile industry."
NBE05585,"It is true that some people say that autonomous cars are beneficial and useful for us. However I think we should deal with danger of using self-driving cars. For example, the government should enact a law that regulates the use of autonomous cars to some degree. And I expect that technology will improve."
NBE05733,"I was surprised that Google was inventing the self-driving cars. That's because Google is famous for searching system. However, I'm excited this new technology. If self-driving cars become main type of cars, we may drive a car without any license. That is an epoch-making invention."
NBE05258,I was surprised that Google is inventing not only computers but also cars. I think self-driving cars will be very convenient for drivers. Because they don't have to pay attention to driving. And everyone can drive cars without licenses. That is very wonderful. But I am worried about the increasing of the number of traffic accidents. I was surprised that traffic accidents kill 1.2 million people worldwide a year now. The evolution of this technology is great. But we must give priority to the safety of people.
NBE06239,"I was surprised at the idea of self-driving cars. It is indeed wonderful that number of traffic accident would become zero by technologies of self-driving cars. However, I suppose that self-driving cars are hard to realize, because there are some difficulties to realize, such as traffic rules among the world. Despite it, I would be happy if Japanese automakers will contribute realizing of the car."
NBE06574,"I think that self-driving vehicles are the revolution of the automobile industry. I was impressed by the news. However, I am worried about the vehicles. Because I can't imagine and feel a sense of incongruity about not driving a car by oneself. Though Automotive Engineers make an effort to improve the vehicles, there is the limit of the machine. Even if self-driving vehicles appear in the market, I will choose conventional ones."
NBE06478,"When I read this article, I think the technology of self-driving cars is very amazing and useful. I cannot believe we may not need to take our driving licenses in the future! However, I suppose that it is not good to overestimate too much of this technology. We must not forget that a car is a dangerous vehicle that easily takes a person's life. The government needs to advance the legislation toward the spread of self-driving cars."
NBE06878,"I've heard about self-driving cars before but I wasn't able to believe that they would come true, so I'm very surprised to read this article and realize the rapid technology innovation. I think self-driving cars is very useful because people who are drunk can 'drive' and we don't come to be serious about drunk driving. In addition, we can 'drive' anything even if we are injured, in poor health and sleepy. As Ray Kurzweil said, however, if an autonomous car may cause an accident, it would be big news so we should consider the demerits. In my opinion, we shouldn't let young children drive. Self-driving cars allow them to drive without licenses but I think the time that they spend with their parents in the car is very important for them."
NBE06755,"I have never heard Google makes cars, so when I read this article, I was so surprised. I thought I wanted to get into a self driving cars someday, when I was a small child. That my dream is coming true in the near future. Autonomous cars is a good invention, but it has a lot of problem. I think great developers will solve it and make our life convenient one."
NBE07368,"The number of traffic deaths has a tendency to decrease, but it is still a problem. The self-driving cars may surely solve this big problem that technology caused. However, I think that it is dangerous to depend all on computers when cyber attacks become a problem nowadays. Is it the best way that the number of traffic deaths reduces by improving an each parson's driving skills after all?"
NBE05767,"I wasn't surprised to hear this news title, but after reading this, I strong realized using this is still difficult. If all cars are changed to self-driving car, of course, it's very convenient. But I don't think traffic accidents decrease dramatically. Indeed, robot technology is used in many field. In car department, it becomes remarkable point. But, computer is not perfect. Traffic accidents happened inevitably. I hope that perfect computer system is invented as soon as possible, and that using self-driving car safely."
NBE07158,"When autonomous car driving s will be on the market, we may not have to take a license. It is a wonderful thing, but we can not eo anything in stopping the autonomous driving. So people who riding cars have to acquire the knowledge about safe driving."
NBE07114,"When I read this article, I was surprised. But, I think this project is very interesting at the same time. I hope perfect self-driving system is cultivated."
NBE06662,"Although developing technology is great and important thing, I think self-driving cars are dangerous for us. Certainly, a number of people die around the world in a traffic accident, but they won't work suddenly. Without driver's license, we cannot do anything when they don't work. So we should be careful of introducing them."
NBE06848,"I think it is no longer just a dream that the artificial intelligence driving cars and humans not do because in recent years, there are astonishing progress of unmanned vehicle. If these technology will make steady progress, that is not impossible to invent auto driving cars and if it will invented, they are very useful. Autonomous will decrease traffic accident and jam certainly, and if it will link with traffic light and make network that control car stream, it will change the society to more efficiency."
NBE05861,"Of course self-driving cars are epoch-making investment. Introducing them into general use will decrease the number of traffic fatalities caused by driver's carelessness, such as drunken driving. But they might raised new problem. If cars would be completely automatic, people would not have to obtain driver's license, and delinquent boys would abuse these cars. I think we should not popularize them until new traffic regulation law system are developed."
NBE07053,"I think that self-driving cars are very convenient because it is clear that accidents by the driving of the elderly person will increase in Japan. But I think that it is difficult to make it widely available because there're no guarantees not to cause an accident. Furthermore, there are a lot of people who want to enjoy driving by themselves. I want to drive a car by myself, too."
NBE06209,"I'm still not completely sure that self-driving vehicles ""hold the key to reducing traffic fatalities"", but sincerely hope they do. If autonomous cars become safer than ones human drives someday, I will use them. Until that day, just hold on. . . Go!Google!"
NBE05531,"I think autonomous cars are very convenient. In fact, they make the physical weak drive weak. However, if automatic system were broken, a big accident would happen. convenience is very important, but we should consider safety."
NBE05507,"I did not know the existence of the self-driving until I read this article. An eco-car running by electricity appeared recently, but now development of the self-driving cars advances. If the cars spread all over the world, they will decrease traffic jam and accident. Moreover production of the cars brings big development and economic effect in various fields. For example, production of new parts, the computer which controls driving, fuel development and service using the car. But the article introduced in The"
NBE06600,"I think autonomous driving car is good. If we use it, we won't be tired when we travel by car, therefore the number of accidents will decrease. Although it is the fact not to secure the safety of autonomous driving car because nobody use it by now. If robotic technology diffuse in the future, its reliability will increase."
NBE05972,"I was surprised, when I read this article. It'll reduces the burden of the people by this technology. It is very important because when the driver is tired, accident rates increases. So the number of accidents is reduced by this technology. I want the Google to develop this technology."
NBE06511,"Knowing what Google was inventing autonomous cars, I don't know the cars are developed to such a step. Certainly, if all of the cars in the world become automatic, car accidents will decline dramatically or disappear. However I'm afraid of this future because people will forget how to drive and in case of system failure, they'll not able to avoid accidents by their own ability."
NBE06897,I agree to realize the society of self-driving cars in the future. That is because I think that autonomous driving contributes to decline the number of traffic accidents by preventing driver's carelessness and mistakes. But I feel fearful a little that artificial intelligence instead of us operate everything in our society. I hope the engineers in artificial intelligence take a risk of the intelligence into consideration and develop the autonomous driving system cautiously.
NBE07437,"If self-driving car is come true, elderly people who can not walk by themselves can go around by themselves. And, this tech can reduce families' burden who want to go to distant places. On the other hand, tech is not perfect. So, if we can realize it, the number of accidents will not decline, I think."
NBE06692,"It's really good thing because human can do more efficient things instead of driving. However, ""hacking"" is huge problem on this issue. Becoming self-driving car common means enormous cars can be hacked and they will be murder machine. Google has many hopes and issues now."
NBE05704,"I don't think autonomous cars are ultimately going to save millions of lives. Without saying that self-driving cars will be convenient by most people. However, computer aren't perfect so accidents will be inevitable. In fact, there are many trouble by using computer. These troubles may not decrease in the future but I think it's OK , because If computer become perfect, people will be decline."
NBE06418,"I think that autonomous vehicles are very very good invention. Nowaday, the traffic accidents are increasing. The more increasing the people which have vehicles are, the more increasing the accidents are. So, I must make ideas which are measures of the traffic accidents. autonomous vehicles are very great as the idea. Therefore, I conclude that autonomous vehicles are great measures."
NBE06539,"This technology is very amazing and interesting. And it is also amazing that the number of traffic accidents will fall. Someday I want to ride the self-driving car. But I wonder if we can deal with them, when they malfunction or break down. Even if the technologies are fantastic, safety depends on our way to use them."
NBE05624,"I think this movement is a good thing because I'm afraid of having a car accident and I don't want to get a driving license. If these cars appear in the future, we needn't go to a tiring driving school!! In spite of these good aspects, there are some problems, driving regulations, safety, license, responsibility of the accident and so on. In any case, this problem will take long time to solve."
NBE05837,"I believe self-driving cars can change traffic conditions all over the world. they don't become tired, sleepy and unconscious because of sick otherwise humans do. Therefore, transportation using Self-driving cars is very safety. In addition, using self-driving cars releases people around the world from traffic jams. Traffic jams are one of the biggest problems in modern society. It is generally said that traffic jams caused by not to keep appropriate distance between a car ahead. However, self-driving cars can keep ideal distance. Thanks to self-driving cars, traffic jams will disappear in the future. Transportation using self-driving cars is very safety and making efficiency."
NBE06358,"Self-driving car will help people who cannot drive by themselves, and it is a revolutionary technology. However, it is uncertainty that a self-driving car will not cause an accident. Therefore, I think that we cannot unconditionally say that it is a safety technology."
NBE06637,"Of course self-driving cars make our lives much more convenient than now. And they must reduce serious accidents caused by driver's carelessness. But they are not perfect. For example, self-driving cars can't response to unexpected accident immediately. And they make children who don't have driving skills want to operate them. That may lead serious social issues. So, I think that self-driving cars should not be popularized until their safeties become certain."
NBE06030,"I think we can solve various problem if all cars become self-driving cars. For example, traffic jam is it. All cars are managed by computer, and information of traffic is shared all cars. And then they think and flash way to arrive at earliest and most comfortable. The danger of traffic accident also largely reduced. So self-driving car is very useful and we should expect completion of it."
NBE05939,Autonomous cars have a lot of merits and may make our life better. However driving cars is so fun that we want to drive by ourselves. For this reason I don't think that autonomous cars will win the market.
NBE05646,"I think that self-driving cars is completed soon, but I cannot agree this system. It is because I think that the accident caused by the computer happens. Who is to blame for the accident? The government has a lot of need to think about including revision of the law."
NBE07275,"Indeed technology and artificial intelligence should be advanced more and more. But if the autonomous car causes an accident , which people have a responsibility , do you think? Also most people have difficulty in answering the situation. And also nobody do not want to take a responsibility for the matter. Probably people want the company to take the responsibility. To advance in the technology is important for the people. But if we want to incorporate the system, we have to consider the law carefully and carefully."
NBE06002,"Google thinks the technology of self-driving is better than previously driving . And I think so. Because if the car move smoothly , there is no traffic jam . Traffic jam is course of Global warming . That is our earth. So we have to do our best for the earth even if we can do only little things!"
NBE07245,"I think that this technology is amazing, because it will reduce many traffic accidents. But if self-driving vehicles spread more, people who work as taxi driver and bus driver and so on will lose their job. So we should think about them."
NBE06444,"I agree to self-driving cars being sold in the market. This is because it can avoid the fatal accident with the car, and people can enjoy a drive more comfortably. However, the self-driving cars do not secure complete safety. I hope that the safety is secured."
NBE05680,"It is true that self-driving cars are convenient and have the benefit that people who don't have a driver's license can drive. However, is artificial intelligence always correct? On the road actually, there are lots of dangers. For instance, there are lots of complicate traffic signs and children that suddenly run into the road. Therefore I cannot be relieved safety of self-driving cars."
NBE07183,"We should be careful when introducing the automobile cars to the market because it's fatal thing. Advance of technology is quite useful to improve people's lives, however, sometimes it invites an end to the civilization."
NBE06283,"It is true that autonomous cars are very useful and they will reduce car accidents, however I think many people enjoy driving on their own. If driving becomes automatic, many people lose their fun of driving."
NBE05803,I think that self-driving cars are great invention in that we can protect the environment and we could avoid a number of accidents. But I don't think everybody likes the system of self-driving cars because there are some people who really likes to drive by themselves. So they should make cars which we can choose when to drive.
NBE06388,I think that Google car will be completed in the future. Now technology is so advanced that we can do what was thought to be impossible in the past
NBE06144,"Self-driving vehicles are very convenient for all of aged people. For Japan of the current aging society, self-driving vehicles will help them very much because the driver who cannot drive can go to the place where he or she wants to go to by self-driving vehicles. They will help not only the elderly person but also the people of the person with a disability."
NBE05560,"I want car to drive. If this car could be true, I'm so exited!"
NBE06781,"When I read the this article's headline , I think autonomous cars will make people happy . But when I read this article completely , I think autonomous cars will make them dangerous , too."
NBE06326,"Until I read the news, I did not this news. So I was very surprised to read. Because it is amazing. When I was a child, I thought that my mother or father can drive with sleeping to go to disney land. Someday when I will a woman, I can drive an automatic car. But those cars are real safe? This article says traffic accidents will really decrease? I think if they introduce this system in earnest , they should be more accurate judgment."
NBE06095,"When I read this article, I think that it is very wonderful invention. If there is self-driving car, the people who don't have a driver's license can move easily. Furthermore, it is good for environment if the car is an eco-car. The car which is good for both environment and a person is very great. However I worry that when balls rolled, what happens to a car? The car should allow you to react ti an obstacle, but a car does not push if forward before when I react to a too thing in front too much. I think that it is important seeing with the people's eye."
NBE07027,"On the one hand, autonomous cars will reduce traffic fatalities and make it possible for those who don't have driving license to drive from children to elderly. On the other hand, because of autonomous cars, hobby, so called ""drive"", will disappear and fire taxi driver and bus driver and so on. Therefore, we must think carefully whether we introduce autonomous cars."
NBE06059,"Automatically car has existed only in sci-fi world for a long time. But now it is becoming a reality. Technology works. It's so exited whenever I imagine what kind of the future we will live in. In the next generation, people may read the article ""Google certain of teleportation"
NBE06060,"Automatically car has existed only in sci-fi world for a long time. But now it is becoming a reality. Technology works. It's so exited whenever I imagine what kind of the future we will live in. In the next generation, people may read the article ""Google certain of teleportation machines in the future""."
NBE05143,"If we can use autonomous vehicles easily in the future, we can go anywhere without driver's license. Add to this fact, to use that will contribute to decrease traffic accident. From these points, we can use those vehicles easily and comfortable. But it will make the situation which there are lot of people who work as a driver will lose their job. Therefore I think to provide autonomous vehicles will do bad effect our society. So we should not generalize it which we use autonomous vehicles."
NBE07401,"I was surprised at this article. Until I read this, I don't know Google's autonomous car. If this car is so safely, I want to ride in a car and go wherever I hope. The point which I am so excited is that people shouldn't acquire driving license. Otherwise, the point which we have to rethink is that streets and parking will change this style when autonomous car spread."
NBE05095,"Reading the headline of this article, I was interested in self-driving cars. At first, I couldn't imagine autonomous driving. But, I ensure that self-driving cars run on the streets in the near future. Self-driving cars have a lot of benefits as the article says. Above all, it is a very good point for self-driving vehicle to reduce traffic fatalities. I hope that the cars will be useful for people."
NBE05351,"I also think that self-driving cars make our lives safer and more comfortable. Giving an concrete example, we can reduce the traffic accidents because of drowsy driving. If truck drivers can sleep in the cars running automatically, they can work efficiently after arriving at their destinations."
NBE05119,I mainly agree with this news because self-driving cars are much more safer than the cars which are driven by human. But I am worried about accidents which self-driving cars may cause in the future. I want these firms to make safer self driving cars for our safety.
NBE05118,"I mainly agree with this article because self driving cars are much more safer than cars which are driven by human. However, I think that self driving cars are not perfect. I want these firms to make safer cars for our safety."
NBE05496,"I am excited to see self-drive cars! But If we buy this car, wouldn't we need a driver license? If so, I am going to be sad because I just get it last month! Though I am excited about self-drive car, then, how will the trains work? It seems the same that we ride on the train and use the self-drive cars. I am also afraid of our cognitive abilities will go down."
NBE06962,"I accepted easily the idea that traffic accidents will decrease by self-driving cars. But, as miku14034026 says, there is no conviction. I agree with your opinion that computer power is not necessarily perfect."
NBE07462,"I agree with your opinion. I don't feel like using this car either. The defects of the self-driving cars may be found, after they are used actually. And I think it's difficult for automobile cars to run a way where existing cars and pedestrians exist."
NBE07333,"I did not think of the problem with job opportunities and it is something we need to consider. Even now, there are some exploited trains without a motorman. The problem is closer than we think."
NBE07297,"As you claim, if self-driving cars become widespread we all can move by car including those who don't have a driver's license. However, people without a license don't have enough knowledge about driving. If a traffic accident is likely to occur, they will not be able to do anything. I think it is dangerous to drive a car without a license even if the car is self-driving one."
NBE05442,"I was surprised at this article. I knew self- stopping cars, but l don't know an existence of self-driving cars. I agree to make cars. For the man, I like driving by myself, who is poor at driving the cars is needed. I would have Google company generate."
NBE05465,"I don't know that autonomous cars have become very popular. I think it is very good to save millions of lives by them. I felt an era and techniques are changing even today. However, i think that i will become scary when i ride such an autonomous car. But a car driven by human is more dangerous than the car. . . . now, the traffic accidents caused by drowsy driving have become big problems I think. Self drive cars can reduce such as accidents !"
NBE06847,"I agree with your opinion. If self-driving cars can realize, but there are problem. It is vulnerable of computer system especially, electronic disturbance. Computer system can hacking easily so if self-driving cars realize, it is questionable for increasing traffic accident. Driving license is need one I think because if car was hacked, the driver have to cut down the power and control car."
NBE05647,"ID15081! That's good idea. I was surprised by a technique of google, too. Not only the car but also all techniques are great. The times when a car of the auto comes up come soon. I am fun!"
NBE07436,"I have not realized the problem that many people use cars without licenses. And, I also think that when we are driving by ourselves and in danger of the traffic accidents, we are able to find the dangerous situations. But, if we use self-driving cars, we will not pay attention to situations and cause more accidents."
NBE05836,"I agree with this idea. To drive cars without license is very good for us. Also, I believe that we rethink our life style. When autonomous cars spread widely, we use cars more frequent than today and the road is very crowded and greenhouse gas emissions increases."
NBE05703,I agree to . People should do by yourself as you can.
NBE05330,"I was surprised at autonomous cars have become very popular. This topic is very interesting . Because they must be safety drive more than people . I think that car accidents will be disappear in the future. And if people go out to dinner, drinking alcohol , autonomous cars instead of the people . I hope that it becomes the reality early."
NBE05389,"I think your idea is good. Recently, there are a lot of automatic things such as cars, and mobiles. However, these automatic things are not complete, so it is not good to rely too much. We should be careful around us."
NBE05388,"I think so too. There are many traffic accidents and people who die in traffic accident, so if these automatic car prevail, the number of these accidents and people will reduce. However, if we ride automatic cars, we should be careful."
NBE05390,"I was convinced your idea. If so, a long-distance truck driver can be more relaxed. There are still problems about automatic vehicles now, but in the future, these things will be developed and prevailed."
NBE06003,I agree with you
NBE06005,I don't think so
NBE05282,"If the autonomous car became popular, almost all of traffic accidents would decrease. It is nothing but good things. However I think we can't depend on the safety of the autonomous car completely. The most important thing is the safety for autonomous car to become popular."
NBE05281,"I didn't came up with the advantage. Certainly if the autonomous car became popular, we can use it when we drink! I agree with your opinion."
NBE05280,"I agree with your opinion. Certainly if autonomous became popular, many traffic accidents can decrease not only the accident of truck but also train or air plain. There are a lots advantage, so I hope the things which is written in this article realize early."
NBE05427,"It is a very difficult issue. Autonomous car is very comfortable for us, but if its system broken, it can't be understand when accidents happen. Also, this can be said for drivers."
NBE05426,"I agree with your idea. If autonomous driving can't be controlled, we have to drive cars alone."
NBE05329,I tend to agree. Your opinion is very nice.
NBE05441,"I read the comment, and agree to your opinion. I was afraid of an autonomous driving car. Even if an accident is caused intentionally, a wrongdoer can blame a machine. I think there isn't supposed to be such incident."
NBE05228,"I agree with you. If they want to popularize the self-driving car, they should produce it perfectly. People will use that kind of cars when it is proved that self-driving cars are absolutely safe. I also want to take it if decent estimation is done."
NBE05036,"Thank you for your agreement. We cannot relate with this car market situation, but let's see carefully about this topic."
NBE05464,I didn't notice that people who have a driver job will lose their job if this autonomous vehicles are used easily in the future. This problem is very serious. The progress of science will change our life and the system making this society I think.
NBE05033,"I also have my driver license. When I read your comment, I also wonder about the same thing. Probably many people disagree with and many trainers lost their jobs."
NBE05035,I think so. And I concern about many people lose their jobs.
NBE07080,Self-driving is very interesting topic. Everyone is hoping that self-driving will be very valuable but still dangerous. It need to gain the credibility in the safety category in order to be spread around as general use.
NBE06007,I thought it was more important to give eye contact for listener than perfect English speaking. And we have to speed control of speaking for listener's understanding. But of course I decided to study English more for my next presentation !
NBE05768,"Surely, some people can't keep up with the new technology. It is obvious to see the smart phone for the elderly people. However, in some case, it is necessary to desert such people for the advance of new thing."
NBE05069,"I think that the news is so good for us. If self-driving car is realized, we could protect a lot of accidents. Also, old people can drive to feel peace of mind"
NBE06964,"I didn't come up with your idea to increase driving without a license. It is very interesting. However I think we can solve that problem. For example, we make the car which cannot drive without scanning our licenses."
NBE06963,"I agree with your idea that employment opportunities will be decreased. I like to talk with the drivers when I use public transportation, so it is sad to lose the chance of talking."
NBE06663,"I agree. Indeed autonomous cars are very charming. We can expect them to reduce accidents and the number of people who die in accident. However, there are some problem. For example, if a accident happen, we can't understand who makes mistake. And when we drive them, we can't understand whether we have to have a driver's license. So we should discuss them."
NBE06693,One more thing that risk of self-driving car is hacking. Self-driving car is used huge IT technology and which means there are much more risks that hacking. Many specialists are warning that automotive companies have to take very strong measures for that of risks.
NBE05530,"I didn't think about that point. Surely, if we left driving to computer, we would not be able to drive by ourselves. Not only in driving but also in anything, we have to do as possible as you can."
NBE07217,The point you focused is interesting. Should a license system be needed for autonomous car? This is a issue we have to think.
NBE06004,I agree with you . But I have some difference opinion from yours. When I read this archive I thought it can be on traffic Jim by self driving . Of course traffic accident decrease .
NBE06096,Your opinion is very interesting. We should think about driving license. I think we should think about drink-driving.
NBE07298,"I don't think that the government needs to advance the legislation toward the spread of self-driving cars. However, there are things to be done before those cars spread. First, security of them should be enhanced more. Then, the government has to make a law to clarify where responsibility lies when traffic accidents occur due to an error of self-driving cars. If these conditions are satisfied, I think the government doesn't need to legislate the spread of them."
NBE07367,"I agree with you. I think so, too. Indeed, There will be a lot of arguments about safety problem self-driving cars have, but they will be came true someday."
NBE06210,"So, what is the trouble?Will perfect autonomous vehicles need license?I cannot see what you mean."
NBE06208,I totally agree with you. Several pieces of legislation should precede turning self-driving to practical use. What an important point!I couldn't realize such a thing. . .
NBE06211,"Your argument is clear, and writing is persuasive. I didn't think of the possibility of self-driving cars reducing or solving a problem like traffic jam. This is very interesting point."
NBE06212,"Your point is partly unclear to me. Why will children with no driving skills getting to be interested in operating be viewed as a problem?Of course, self-driving cars may not be perfect in avoiding accidents. But how can children make serious social issue?"
NBE06445,"The population of the truck driver decreases year by year, and the aging advances, too. The times when self-driving cars is necessary may be going to come. . ."
NBE06601,I think so. This technology surprised us. Especially I sympathized the point you think this topic is interesting; autonomous cars must be safety drive more than people.
NBE06754,I agree with you. I could not notice what employment opportunities will be decreased. I think self-driving has both merit and demerit.
NBE05302,Your idea is interesting for me. But I think we should not too trust self-driving car. We cannot say machine trouble is never happened. We have to pay attention to situation of driving at least a little.
NBE06638,"Realizing what Google was inventing autonomous cars, I surprised that the cars are developed to such a step. But I think autonomous cars are two-edged swords. Certainly, if all cars become automatic operating, car accidents which are caused by human's carelessness will decline dramatically. However I'm afraid of this future because people in case of system failure, they'll not able to avoid accidents by their own ability."
NBE07157,"Increasing people not having the license may certainly be going to be the big problem. When automobile car is out of order, they can't do nothing. If it is emergency or being delayed, we will regret for not having the license."
NBE05860,"I also think that autonomous cars can be effective resolution of two sides; reducing traffic accidents and traffic jams. The former includes fatalities, the latter consumption of the gasoline, as you said. So these cars are good for people and environment."
NBE06997,"I also think so. It is true that Self driving car is very convenient and help many people who can't drive but If it happens accident, it's responsibility is whose? UNtil this problem is resolved, Self driving car should be not introduced"
NBE07052,"I imagined the world that autonomous cars are spread. When an accident happened, who takes responsibility for the accident? There is a problem in such an area as well as safety. If the problems can be settled, we should make it widely available."
NBE05971,"I think so too. If autonomous cars infiltrate our life, we will be able to live comfortably. However, It makes new risks."
NBE07051,"I agree with your opinion. In this aging society, the accidents caused by elderly people will increase. But most elderly person can use only easy system. The companies should make easy and safety system. To help the people with a disability is wonderful!"
NBE05623,"I quite agree with you. Feeling sleepy or tired lead to a number of traffic accidents. In my family, who can drive car is only my father, so he always says ""I'm tired, and I wish this car was a autonomous driving car for only a short time. "" when he is driving. So I'm glad to hear of this news and it is also good for the people who haven't driven car for a long time so called 'paper driver' like my mother."
NBE06814,"I was amazing at this technology too. However, I was fear that driver is replaced by autonomous driver. Now, I go to school to get the driving license. I feel I can't rely on self driving cars."
NBE06512,"Like you said, I also think the government draw up some new laws about automatic driving. If these cars are developed and people come to need not to drive by oneself, who has the responsible? We? The company which produce one's car? The other people? There have been a lot of problems yet."
NBE07274,I was very surprised with your opinion. I can not think that way and that aspect. New employment have to be given to the people.
NBE05838,"I disagree with your idea because I believe the ""perfect"" self-driving system cannot exist. However great the system is, every system has the possibility of making errors. In addition, the biggest problem is the absence of a person in charge of safety. Therefore, I believe human beings should drive our cars on our own and drivers must be responsible for the safety of other traffic."
NBE05940,I don't think so. I think driving by human is much more dangerous than by machine.
NBE05679,"I agree with your opinion. I am also worried if the self driving car can predict and prevent some risks. Indeed, it is very convenient that we don't have a driver's license, but I think quick decision and prediction of danger are human's peculiar techniques, so I'm scared that people completely rely on these artificial intelligence."
NBE06175,"I think so. Autonomous car driving still has many problems. If autonomous driving cars were sold, society not absolutely prevents many problems of autonomous driving system like a drone."
NBE06899,"Like your opinion, I was surprised at this news and autonomous cars have excellent potential to reduce the consumption of the energy for driving cars and decrease the number of traffic accidents and get rid of the traffic jam. But I'm worried that the only computer without us drives. When autonomous cars run on an expressway, if the computer is out of order, there is a possibility to cause a miserable traffic accident. I think that we should drive cars by ourselves until we will be able to put absolute confidence in autonomous cars."
NBE06898,"I agree your opinion. I also think that in case autonomous cars bring about traffic accidents, there aren't laws to judge who have the responsibility in Japan. So I think we cannot see autonomous cars running on the roads in Japan unless we make enough preparation such as the law system and the confidence in autonomous cars."
NBE06006,"I felt this article's idea is nice idea for something. For example , for traffic jam and traffic accident. But of cause it's not completely/ it's have to be careful for cyber terrorism."
NBE06930,"I want to get on this car. However, If this car can't control by our own hands, when this car's service is broken, we are likely to die of traffic accidents. So, we try to do more things."
NBE06387,"I don't want this self driving car . Because if we too rely on this car we cannot concentrate while driving. This is too dangerous. So, we are more likely to happen traffic accident"
NBE05914,Development of autonomous cars will make our life more comfortable. But I'm not going to take these car
NBE06782,"Your opinion is very interesting . But I don't think so. It is true that many driver will be not able to get a job, but they can get other jobs like a job to assemble a car ."
NBE07216,"I thought the same thing. To make the system that nobody can take responsibility is irresponsible. I heard Tokyo University is inventing the road assisting cars to flow efficiently on main streets. In this case, government take the responsibility."
NBE06357,"I did not know the autonomous cars began to become popular, and they must be safety drive more than people. I think it is helpful for people with a handicap to drive by themselves. If that is realized in the future, many people can try to drive safely. So, I think that it is an epoch-making idea."
NBE06282,"I agree with your idea. More and more useful things are prevailed in our society , it is good of course, but sometimes it hurts many people."
NBE07079,"I agree with you in some parts. Self-driving car was a total fantasy that I never thought that it will come true. Just like our grandparents never thought smartphones will be part of our real world. science has provided us dreams and convenience that no other studies have provided to the human society. It became a fact that science has the power to improve our life. However, as famous quote states that ""absolute power, corrupt absolutely"", which means that not only powerful figure will be corrupted and give bad influence to the world but powerful technology can be a trigger to a corrupted world. That is why we have to be very careful about new technology."
NBE07081,"When self-driving cars are populated, there will be a marked problem that it is going to face such as the safety. Safety problem will be the biggest and the never-ending problem for self-driving cars. self-driving cars will never be common unless it has overcome the problem of safety and gain the trust from majority."
NBE06174,"I agree to autonomous driving cars being sold in the market in future, too. Using self-driving system, we will decrease a lot of fatal accidents and prevent traffic jam. Although this system is still future system. It is necessary for us to add improvement to the system."
NBE07334,I understand how you feel! Enjoying daily conversation in transportation system is important in our lives when you think about losing the opportunity. I do want drivers who love their vehicle to stay there and give children hope and dreams.
NBE07244,I agree with your opinion. There are a lot of benefits. For example to help many people who can't drive because of physical. So this invention will may help mainly the people who can't drive because of physical. And we should think a preparation of new laws.
NBE06510,"I was also surprised and excited when I first met this amazing news. These days, not only automatically cars but also a lot of items which have been appeared only in SF world are invented. As you say, teleportation machines may be exist in a real world in future. Everyone may own robots like Doraemon someday. I want to see such a world till I died."
NBE06061,"I agree with you. The manual license has been replaced driver license limited to automatic transmission cars now. In the future, no license will become usual."
NBE07435,"By using this technology, we can make this world more useful. But, it has also demerits, I think. Too relying on this technology tend to cause car accidents. So we should use it in right place."
NBE07026,"I think so too. If autonomous cars will be realized, although, in fact, autonomous cars are more safe than cars which human drive, I would feel autonomous cars more dangerous and cars which human drive comfortable. However, absolutely autonomous cars is profitable for human."
NBE05094,"I don't think so. The self-driving car is safer than existing car, I think. As you say, the self-driving car is not perfect. But, Google tries to make it nearly perfect. So, I believe this cars."
NBE05373,I also think it is important to consider not only the convenience of autonomous cars but also the safety of them.
NBE05353,Your idea is very interesting. This technology will reduce the number of traffic accident. But I think the drivers don't have to get driving licenses because they won't drive by themselves.
NBE05352,I think also the development of autonomous cars will be our lives more comfortable. But why aren't you going to take these cars?
NBE05198,I agree with you. It is interesting if it comes true that perfect self-driving system is in use everywhere.
NBE05117,"I agree with you. As you mentioned above, if the self-driving cars become popular, almost all of the traffic accidents would disappear. I also think it is important to make safe self-driving cars"
NBE06325,"I was imagining the car which is autonomous too. Today, from now on we will be in new trouble ."
NBE05802,"I can see what you are saying. We tend to be interested in new technologies and we tend to think we have to use them. But It's not true. As you say, we can use public transportation to reduce traffic accident instead of using cars."
NBE05068,I agree with your opinion. The technology should be developed carefully
NBE07490,"When I saw this news, I partly feel happy because I am very bad at driving but at the same time I feel sad because these days I gradually start enjoying driving. I think driving is kind of sports or exercise. I know it occurs so many death accident, but people have been driving for a long years and it also became our culture. people compete their skill of driving. sometimes boys tried to drive their car really cool in from of girls. I liked such kind of culture. of course non-driver cars will bring us safer more comfortable future, but if everything make automatic, people will lose their own way and lose competence."
NBE07500,"It is a trendy topic in Japan now because the three biggest car companies, Toyota, Nissan and Honda, are making self-driving cars and Prime minister Abe tried to get in the car, which Toyota invented. I watched this news recently and it said that they would be running on the public roads in 5 years. However I'm not excited that it will be real. I feel like everything will be robot like the stuffs in the hotel's front and these self-driving cars. I'm sure that Japan have great technologies and I'm proud of them but it is getting too much. I'm wandering who have responsibilities when car accidents occur. I feel people no longer are needed and we will not have to work. It will make people more lazy and I'm afraid of people will get foolish because we don't have to work, perhaps we will not need to study. Also I'm afraid of loosing our tradition and culture. Japanese technologies can be our culture but I want to keep out culture which has protected for long time."
NBE07082,"The process of memorizing vocabularies is inevitable for ESL students. Therefore, being creative about memorizing vocabularies is useful and good for yourself."
NBE07335,"The expression ""it shouldn't be a place for new words to be left and forgotten. "" left me a strong impression. I know it happens all the places before the test and many people including me struggles with the reason why I memorize the words. I would like to learn vocabularies that are practical or useful in real-life conversation."
NBE07464,"It is very important to memorize not only English words and Japanese meanings but also collocations for useful English. I really feel that I can't master practical English even if I learn only English words and Japanese meanings, through the former English learning. I would like to learn collocations and how to use words in order to master English which can be used actually."
NBE06966,"I have tried to make my own Vocabulary Notebook since I started to study English, and considered it best. However, I felt I could update it better through discussing in my class and reading this article. My favorite example of Vocabulary Notebook is the fourth because we can receive much information in English. Especially, my notebook needs information of collocations. I want to improve English skills more, so I try to learn collocations more. I decided to use collocation's website which teacher taught us and make my new Vocabulary Notebook like the fourth example from now on."
NBE06097,"I had homework to make vocabulary notebook when I was a high school student. Then it was rule to write Japanese meaning, pronunciation and example sentence to the vocabulary notebook. I think that it is very important to write pronunciation and example sentence. I did a lot presentation or debate when I was a high school student and a junior high school student because I did not take an entrance examination. Therefore I talked in word which I knew, but I did not remember many words. I think that I want to remember many words. My favorite vocabulary notebook is fourth example, because we can understand usage of the word. I think that this notebook is helpful at the time of debate and presentation."
NBE05890,"I made little of a vocabulary notebook because I think that it is useless to memorize only vocabulary. But I realize that it depends on ability whether I can make good use of it or not. From this time on, I will try to figure out a way to make a best use of it, referring to some examples on this page."
NBE06756,"I think most of students used the first type, and I am one of them. That style is useful for entrance examination, the test, and the quiz, but not effective way for speaking. Speaking English is our goal, so I should change the style of vocabulary notebook."
NBE07300,"The value of vocabulary notebook depends on whether it is practical or not. I thought the notebook which collocations and example sentences are written is the most useful not only in studying for exam, but also in speaking English actually. And such a notebook may be called practical. Through reconsidering how to make a good vocabulary notebook, I realized afresh that the effective shortcut to improve our English skills is acquiring expression of natural English. I want to learn natural English by making a practical vocabulary notebook from now on."
NBE06815,"I think that I have to make various improvements in my vocabulary notebook because I have ever made the notebook like the first example . When I study English in university or in future, speaking and writing are more important than English tests. Therefore, I will add collocations in my notebook like forth notebook, I would like to improve my English skill."
NBE07438,"I think the first and third vocabulary notebook are the best to study English for exams which are made by Japanese. But, these are not enough to brush up English. Then, the second is like English-English dictionary. this one needs leading skill. For the reasons stated above I think the second one is good ."
NBE07159,"Writing example sentences and English meanings is very useful. If we can not make native speakers understand a word, we can tell them by example sentences and English meanings. It helps us to speak English in remembering a word."
NBE06602,"I think we need to many words and their contents to learn English, but it is so difficult to memorize them. We need to choose some contents. I think one of the most important content is word family. If we memorize them, we can remember necessary word to guess them when we forget it. Firstly, we should learn word family. Secondly, we learn other contents."
NBE06999,"I have made vocabulary notebook by writing English words on the left, and Japanese meanings on the right for now. But i saw this article and i thought that my way should be changed because my way is useless to speak and listen english. Therefore, i will adopt new way:example sentences, english meanings , synonyms, pronunciation, collocations."
NBE06240,"I was surprised to know there are lots of ways to make vocabulary notes. Especially, I did not have ideas of word maps and collocations. Because, when I was high school student, I did not have any idea of word maps and collocations. So that, I was interested in making such notes. However it was difficult for me to understand and memorize all sentences. I supposed that our circumstances will change to need more knowledge of international negotiation, presentation and writing in English. Therefore, I would like to make my own notes, using these ideas."
NBE07115,"I have made vocabulary notebook by first example. When I read this article, I realized importance of collocations and synonyms. I will try to make perfect vocabulary notebook."
NBE05586,"First, I made a vocabulary notebook by writing English words on the left, and Japanese meanings on the right because it took me a few minutes to make a vocabulary notebook. However, I found collocation important in the last class. If I almost understand collocation, I could naturally talk to foreigners and they could easily comprehend what I say. Therefore, I will make a vocabulary notebook by taking collocation into account"
NBE06879,"I was surprised to realize that there are various vocabulary notebooks which I had never seen. We often make simple vocabulary notebooks to save a time, but in making them, I think, it is the most important to write how to use the vocabulary. Many Japanese people can read English, but cann't speak it. There are some words that I know their meanings but don't know how to use them, so I tend to be in trouble in speaking English. If we try to write some example, I think the Japanese, especially the students, would come to improve their English skills."
NBE05508,"There were many forms of vocabulary notebook, but I assumed that vocabulary notebook was only the form of first example. This form is simple and is easy to see, however it is useless for speaking English. I knew It was important that I wrote collocations and example sentences in vocabulary notebook to improve speaking English. I will try to make new vocabulary notebook."
NBE05769,"First, I think the third example is good because it include pronunciation and various meanings. However , at the same time, it require a long time to make a notebook. So, I conclude that this example is not efficient. Second, I think the second example is good. Though it is hard to see instantly it is good for learning. We can learn real meaning. Adding various collocations and pronunciation is better. Therefore, I think we should make a notebook like a second example because it is the most effective way and most of us improved reading skills enough."
NBE06145,"I think that I must place importance in one something when we make our vocabulary notebooks. If we write in many points and example sentences at them, we will fail to make good notebooks. Personally, I like third example. It is very easy to learn meanings of word families. So, I can learn many meanings efficiently."
NBE06722,"I am weak in memory work. So, when I memorize words of Japanese history, I write word maps. Therefore, I think the best method of learn English words is word maps, too. I thought Japanese meaning is the most important before, but I am thinking that using of the words is the most important. I want to try word maps."
NBE06419,"I have thought that the vocabulary notebook of the common ideal is the third example of vocabulary notes. It is the vocabulary notebook which someone write about derivatives and parts of speech. It is the very very beautiful vocabulary notebooks. However, Mr. Marchand told us that the best vocabulary notebook is the fourth example of vocabulary notes. Indeed, the discovery gave me an impact, but I decide to write a notebook by this method from now on. I will learn many new words by this method."
NBE05862,"When I was a high school student, I tried to remember meaning, pronounce, and derivatives of words only for examination. But now I am in university, and want to learn more practical English to communicate with foreign people. I think it is essential for me to remember not only grammatical information but also how to use the word in actual English conversation. So, example sentences or word map are very effective in making my vocabulary notebook better."
NBE05532,"It is very important of writing many words in order. At first, I think it is the most important just to write their Japanese meaning next to them. But, I understood that it is the most important to write examples for them. when I write them , I want to be care for that point."
NBE06213,"Every example help me understand what is important to make a good vocabulary notebook. I made one just like the example1, but now I realize synonyms and pronunciations must also be listed. I will make a new one."
NBE06479,"I think the fourth example is good because I can study the correct way to use the words. When I was a high school student, I made a vocabulary notebook like the first example only to memorize words. It was very easy to make this simple vocabulary notebook. But it was hard to memorize the words. From now on, I will try to write collocations and synonyms in my new vocabulary notebook to expand my vocabulary. And, I would like to improve my writing skills."
NBE07369,"I think it is important for vocabulary notebooks from now on not only plain, but also how much we can get close to English when we use them. Therefore, we should write synonyms and example sentences at them and allow ourself to read more English words. In addition, we shouldn't write Japanese too much. It may let us understand English much easier, but it is no good to rely on it."
NBE06540,"I think the third example is best vocabulary notebook because I can see words and meanings really well, and there're pronunciations. Not only the meaning but also the pronunciation is important. But, through the last class, I also found it important to memorize actual usage. So I try to write the usage in my vocabulary notebook from now on."
NBE06931,I will try to make the best vocabulary note in this class!
NBE06694,"I like forth example because its highly easy to understand the structure of mean of words. We needed to just remember english words a few months ago, but now, we have to remember them in order to use them freely. So, forth example is little bit difficult to remember, but its best way to remember looking in long term."
NBE05973,"When we memorized English words, it is important that to learn how to use of the word. If we don't know how to use, we can't use the word. That's too bad. So, the second and forth example are very good method."
NBE06900,"I am not good at memorizing English vocabularies. But in the latest class, I found that my way to learn vocabularies by heart isn't the way enough to memorize it smoothly. I had the memorizing way to write English words on the left and Japanese meaning on the right. So this way is clear and easy to make English notebooks, I have continued to practice this way since I was a junior high school student. But I think it is also important to exploring how words fit together into common words. Viewed in the light that using vocabularies to speak, the way is better. I try it and hope to increase vocabularies smoothly."
NBE05839,"When I made vocabulary notebook, I only thought I got good scores in Japanese-English word tests. Although I kept good scores in the tests, I was not able to understand how to use English words in English writing and speaking. As a result, I am poor at expressing my feeling to others in English. However, my thought in learning English was changed by activities in this class. Since I determine my vocabulary notebook has example sentences, my English skills must improve rapidly."
NBE06359,"The vocabulary notes are important to memorize meanings of words and how to use these vocabularies, so it has to be easy to see and understand. Therefore, those examples will be helpful for our studying. I wrote just vocabularies and the Japanese meanings on a vocabulary notebook last week, but I want to try the other way to memorize words."
NBE05734,"I had made vocabulary notebooks like example 1 which have only Japanese meaning. Now, however, I think how to use the word is also important. So, I'd like to try to make my notebooks like 4 adding Japanese meaning and examples."
NBE07246,"I think that Vocabulary Notebooks is very important to understand English words and how to use them. So, I want to refer to them and try to accept them."
NBE07402,"When I made vocabulary notebook last week, it was same for the first example. I always write this type since I began to learn English. It is difficult to memorize English words in this way. I will take advantage of this opportunity and want to change my vocabulary note's style. I think the third example is easy to look and so beautiful. I like this. But, what I want to imitate is the second and the fourth. I have an image that English-English dictionary is difficult, but if I make good use of it , I will make progress English. The fourth example's good point is easy to understand common phrases, so we use actively in speaking. I will try these type's good points."
NBE06284,"Each example shows good points, and it is worth trying all examples. Personally, however, I want to create the notebook which I don't look at in any example."
NBE05625,"I have made vocabulary notebooks in the way of first example ever, but I think that second example is the most useful way. The good aspect of it is making us learn and feel real meanings of English words, so we can use words like native speaker. In addition, if you add example sentences in English, you can improve your vocabulary skill efficiently. So I made vocabulary notebook again in the second example way!"
NBE06176,"I'm interested in collocation type vocabulary notebook. I have never seen this vocabulary notebook. At first time, I thought it was not vocabulary notebook but brain storming. Example sentences is effective for using English words in vocabulary notebook. Also, synonyms is useful for memorizing many English words. I 'd like to try collocation, example sentences and synonyms in my vocabulary books."
NBE07028,Vocabulary notebook is important when we learn English. Therefore it is important for us to think how to make vocabulary notebook. I think collocation is useful and improve our English skills
NBE07276,"I think the third example is useful for me. To read the English text fluently, we have to memorize many words. I used this type of notes when I studied hard and hard to enter this university. Remembering one word triggers another word. I think example sentences and collocations is important."
NBE05941,I think that the first example is the best for English test. However it is not the best way for speaking which is our biggest purpose to study foreign languages. So I think that the forth example is the most useful because it tells me the collocation.
NBE07054,"When we make vocabulary notebook, it is important to learn how to use the words and meanings in English. I have used the vocabulary notebook which written English words on the left and Japanese meanings on the right . So I'd like to make notebook including the example sentence."
NBE05648,"I am agreeable for how to make the fourth notebooks, because this notebook is very simple and many example. However There is the point that should be improved in this notebook. It is no Japanese mean. When I looked in this suddenly, I do not understand it. I improve this, and I intend to make a notebook only for oneself."
NBE06008,I thought it's important to write Japanese meanings . But now I think it's important to write English meaning too . Because it's not usual that English can be translated to Japanese . So we have to understand in English .
NBE06783,"I think the forth example is the best one in all after I read this article because it is difficult to see but, it includes the collocations and word families . I wanna make the best vocabulary notebook like the forth one ."
NBE06031,"I think memorizing English words is very important to speak English at will. And to memorize English words, we should gather it up briefly. What it is easy to see help us memorizing. But With it only it is not good. If we want to memorize the words for a long term, we have to write it many times and practice. These are very important, I think."
NBE07218,"I don't like to make a English words book because it takes too much times . I want to use the time for reading more and more sentences. A word can't make sense as itself. It can be meaningful only when it is in a sentence. So if teachers want their student to learn a word, they should find a sentence which makes the word stand out."
NBE05681,"I think most students use first type. It is useful for vocabulary test, but it won't help you when you speak or writing in English. For acquiring practical English skills, it is effective to write collocation and example sentences for each word in vocabulary notebook. In this way, what I learned from comparing several example of vocabulary notebook is that if you don't use much time for making vocabulary notebook, you will forget the word easily."
NBE05804,I think I like the first example because It's been the way I have been doing for these six years and I've got used to it. But I also like the second example because in that way I can explain those words in English and It is so useful when speaking English compared to the first example. I wish I can find the good note for studying through this semester.
NBE06327,I think that vocabulary notebooks are our english skills' base. But I think it not only writs but also understand the meanings. And we need to use the meanings. So I will use example sentences.
NBE05705,"I think first example is the best way to learn the English words because I've got used to this type for long time and got over the most English test . But the most well-ordered type is third example. Ultimately, if you can learn the new words, the way to learn the words is whatever you like, I think."
NBE06664,"It's difficult for us, Japanese people to memorize many words, but it's important thing. We need to memorize many words efficiently. So I think the important thing is simple for a vocabulary notebook. We should write meanings and a part of speech only."
NBE06513,"I want to make the notes like the fourth example because I believe that the most important thing in making notes is how useful the note is. Certainly, the note like the first example and third one is very good in making notes as students who make those notes finish making quickly, but they'll forget words quickly, too. On the other hand, the students who make notes like the second one and fifth are good for memorizing words' meanings in English. However, students take a lot of time to make notes. The fourth one is very good in both memorizing new words and the time required, moreover memorizing words' collocations together. Then this note is useful when students communicate with people whose native language is English without using same words."
NBE06062,"I like the second one. When I Make vocabulary books, I also check the Japanese meaning. And if it is difficult one, I enter the Japanese meaning."
NBE05230,"I didn't have an idea to write a word map in a vocabulary notebook, so I was surprised. I think it is good. We will be able to use the word in sentence thanks to the map. I want to use this method in my own vocabulary notebook."
NBE05120,I have never seen a lot of vocabulary notebooks which other students wrote. I was surprised by clearness of them. I think it is important to write meanings of words not only in Japanese but also English.
NBE05375,"I haven't write a lot of information about words so much, so I decide to write example sentences, word family or so. I want to make my vocabulary notebook easy to understand from now on."
NBE05166,"I often had difficulty in making vocabulary notebooks, so these information was very useful for me. In particular, I had not known word maps, so I had strong interest in it. I want to use it and make a renewable vocabulary notebook right away. In addition, I wish I can get higher score on vocabulary tests."
NBE05259,"I made a vocabulary notebook which written only Japanese meanings. But I realized most important things for making vocabulary notebook is it has a lot of information. For example, collocations, pronounce nations, word maps and example sentences. So I decided to make notebook which has a lot of information."
NBE05303,I think that word maps are good idea to remember words with visual type. Long remaining in our brain is very important so I try to use word maps. I will make symbol and organized vocabulary notebook.
NBE05392,"In the class, I understood what is the important point for making vocabulary notes. The purpose of taking vocabulary note is not for just taking note but for remembering and using words. So I think it is important to write collocations in my vocabulary note. If so, I learn the words and how to use it in speaking and writing. I will try ."
NBE05466,"I understood the important of making vocabulary notebooks by the class. I have made it only the English words with the meaning of Japanese, but I think it is too simple and I can't learn English vocabulary well. I knew a lot of good idea so I would like to try making my original vocabulary notebook. Especially, I try to check collocations, pronounce nations, word maps and example sentences. By doing these things, I will learn new vocabularies clear."
NBE05283,"Thanks to this class I can understand the importance to making the vocabulary notebooks. This article tell me how to make it not only in Japanese but also in English. Although I usually wrote the vocabulary which I couldn't understand, it is too simple to study English. So I try to write a relating noun, adjective, adverb and idiom after this."
NBE05037,"When I make vocabulary note, I wrote only the word's meaning but I understand that way was wrong. To hear this class, I knew more effective way so I want to try it."
NBE06967,"I have a lot of friends who are from Fukushima. When the terrible earthquake occurred they had many difficulty. I know the terror of nuclear power, and people who suffered losses by nuclear power. I won't see the damage of nuclear power. Certainly we can generate electricity efficiently by nuclear power, but we have another way to do it. I think we shouldn't use nuclear power because it has a bad influence."
NBE05232,"I don't want the government to use nuclear plant to produce energy. There was nuclear accident in Fukushima in 2011. I felt scared to see the accident on TV, and I took pity on the people of Fukushima. In Japan, there are a lot of energy sources such as geothermal. I think it has no reason to use nuclear power absolutely. The government should think about not using the nuclear plant, and replace other energy."
NBE07002,Nuclear power is very risky but suddenly decreasing nuclear power is necessary good. It is because suddenly decreasing nuclear power increase burning power and increase greenhouse gas. Therefore not that nuclear power forcibly is changed into burning power but that nuclear power slowly be changed into natural energy is good way.
NBE07184,"The FIT system is quite magnifique to encourage the use of green power source. We have to earnestly think about how we live with limited source. In recalling the tragedy in Fukushima, we should never make it happen again even accidentally."
NBE06665,"Certainly, geothermal potential is huge and geothermal is cheap, reliable and works 24 hours a day. In addition, it's dangerous to use nuclear power. However, nuclear power the most economic. The price of electricity rise increasingly, so we are needy. Inventing renewable sources, first of all I think we should turn nuclear plans back on."
NBE06849,"This is very stimulating story for us. In Japan, after Fukushima disaster, it is very animated at discussion of way of energy provision. I think we have to search many way of energy provision because if it will be impossible to provide energy one way, we can cover it by another way. Dispersing risk is basic thinking of energy policy. So, I think we must not throw away the technique of nuclear. Of course, we know about the risk of nuclear disaster, but at the same time, we have to think about if we lose all way to provide energy except nuclear, what we should do."
NBE07302,"We experienced the tragic accident in Fukushima that costs much time and money to recover. It is extremely difficult to ensure the safety of nuclear power. So I oppose resuming nuclear power plant operations. However, if we abandon nuclear power, in actually, we may possibly suffer from a serious electric shortage in the near future. Consequently, I think what we should do is to economize on electric power and to develop renewable energy sources positively."
NBE05395,"I think energy problems are very complicated. In Japan, we have reconsidered nuclear power's problems such as higher fuel bills and higher emissions since we experienced the Fukushima disaster. I don't support a return to nuclear power because it is the most important to ensure the safety of human lives. Following the Fukushima disaster, Japanese government has been pushing ahead with generating renewable power, but there are also some problems. I think cheap energy is important for me, but for the earth and Japan, it is important to improve green energy because there are limits of natural resources. I think we should reconsider the future renewable energy based on a hard look at what things will be like ten years from now."
NBE06241,"I don't agree with the policy change by Shinzo Abe to turn the nuclear plants back on. Firstly, nuclear energy has bad and fatal points than good points. I know that nuclear energy has good points such as lower cost. However, nuclear energy has bad points such as radiation, radioactive waste. In addition, as we went through Fukushima disaster, we cannot restore environment completely. Then, people who lived in near nuclear plant cannot go back to their house. If we continue to use nuclear energy, same situation would happen. All in all, I believe that we should shift into energy that is safe and environmental. I hope safe and economical energy will be developed to replace nuclear and thermal energy in the near future."
NBE05261,"I think Japan's government depend on a nuclear power plant too much. A nuclear power plant can generate many electricity. So it has many benefits. But it has also many risks. March, 2011, big earthquake occurred in the Tohoku district. Many people had to take refuge. Because, the nuclear power plant went up in a tremendous explosion. So we should stop to depend on it. We should use solar panels on own house and think a good way to produce many power."
NBE05144,"It is difficult to spread electricity without nuclear power. But to think the Fukushima disaster, we can not use the power easily. If such a disaster happen again, Japan will have to spend enormous time and money for the solution to the problem. Japan has not utilized the power enough yet. So I think Japan should try to spread renewable energy. Therefore I think it is better to use renewable power than to use nuclear power."
NBE06098,"I think that renewable energy is very good idea for protecting Japanese nature, so I think that Japan should use renewable energy. There are 3 merits of using renewable energy. First points is that renewable energy is good for environment. For example if a day proves right, the photovoltaic power generation is possible. The toxic substance does not appear. Second point is that resources do not disappear. Japan has few resource, so the securing of resources is important. Third point is that if Japan use renewable energy, it is not necessary to use nuclear power. After the Great East Japan Earthquake, the nuclear power generation is dangerous. for reasons of above three, I think that Japan should use renewable energy."
NBE05891,"I think that the study of renewable sources should be supported increasingly. Although Japan needs the cheap reliable power, we have to shut down nuclear power plants in the future. Preparing for that time, we must find the other effective ways to generate energy."
NBE05167,"The Fukushima disaster in March 2011 influenced and changed not only Japan but also some countries, I think. We all realized the nuclear reactors' fear and Japan shut down all of them in Japan. It is still maintained, but I think that their restart is not so far. Surely, I don't want Japan to restart them because of our and our children's living on the earth. I claim that we shouldn't depend on the power of nuclear. The technology here is pretty developed so we must find better ways of making energy efficiently without nuclear reactors. Also, if selling electricity becomes more common, more the better ways will be found from its actions. Briefly, the expanding of solar system will solve the energy problem shortly, I think. I wish solar panels' prices will be lowered."
NBE07160,"Turning the nuclear plants back on will be a big help for getting energy, but it is dangerous and risky. Recently, though we do not hear the news about the nuclear problems, we have to think about them seriously. It is a important problem for Japan."
NBE07057,"I think that the return to nuclear power is risky because earthquakes increase recently in Japan. However, depending on thermal power generation is also bad for environment. The earth is not a thing only for Japan. It is desirable to use the renewable energy to the maximum. Now technology is developing every day. So, I believe that it is realized."
NBE06817,"We tend to think that the way to keep Japanese electric supply is nothing but the return to nuclear power like Abe's argument. Also, the risk of nuclear power is forgotten recently . However, there are a lot of potential ways to generate renewable energy in Japan. So, I think that Japan should use not nuclear power but more reliable and cheaper power such as geothermal."
NBE05588,"I agree with nuclear power generation for some reasons. It is true that some people say that as a nuclear disaster happened in Fukushima, nuclear power generation is dangerous. However, it is a man-made disaster and nuclear power itself is not dangerous. Japan has few natural resources and ways to use natural energy such as hydro, wind, tidal, solar and, geothermal, so Japan need to depend on nuclear power. Of course, the problem of radioactive waste must be considered. Meanwhile the way to use natural energy has to be improved."
NBE07117,"I think Japanese government should switch around renewable energy from nuclear power. In fact, nuclear power plant accident cause serious problem in Fukushima. However, renewable power don't spread yet. So, Japanese government must spread renewable power in all of Japan."
NBE05649,"After Fukushima disaster, we cannot use nuclear power. So we should find new power energy, wind, solar, tidal, and geothermal. However these energies are little energy, so the solution to this problem is difficult."
NBE06576,"I think that an alternative energy source should be examined for its safety, efficiency and so on. Since Fukushima disaster happened, nuclear power generation became serious problem. In other words, before that people are not rejective for nuclear power generation. If nuclear power is managed properly, it should not be abolished. If an alternative energy source is introduced, government should reveal its safety."
NBE05974,"I think the nuclear power is very useful. Nuclear power generation can be suppressed carbon emissions compared to thermal power generation. However, I think it is dangerous to rely on nuclear power, because the earthquake occurs many times in Japan. In 2011, an accident had happened at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station. This accident resulted in extensive damage. So, we should know that the nuclear power is very useful, but if we mistake in how to use, it is very dangerous."
NBE05650,"After Fukushima disaster, we cannot use nuclear power. So we should find new power energy, wind, solar, tidal, and geothermal. However these energies are little energy, so the solution to this problem is difficult. Present Japan exhausts a large quantity of CO2. This is very bad in environment. The global warming turns worse more if not improved."
NBE05509,"A nuclear power has advantages that make much energy cheaply and easily. But also it has risks. We should not forget the nuclear accident in Fukushima in 2001. This accident frightened us. Disappearing radiation flowed in the sea and was blown by wind. So it brought damage in many areas and changed our lifestyle. Actually, my parents came to use Water Server to hear the news which many radiations were detected in the tap water. I think it is necessary to use renewable energy effectively. I hope the life which don't depend on nuclear power comes true some day."
NBE06724,"I think nuclear power plants have to be shut down. Nuclear power is dangerous. Japanese government must think another power that can replace it. I think the best power is energy of ocean current, because Japan is islands and it is surrounded in the sea. To shutdown all nuclear power plants promptly is very difficult, but we have to keep thinking how shut down the plants."
NBE07466,"The government should promote not nuclear power but renewable power, I think. Renewable energy has some advantages. First, they will contribute to conservation of the environment, because they don't discharge exhaust fumes and toxic substances. Second, if we make good use of renewable energy, natural resources won't be exhausted. However, there are also disadvantages. For example, it's difficult for renewable energy to secure of stable supply, and they will cost a great deal. So I think Japanese government need to give financial assistance and reconsider the location of renewable power plants. I hope that renewable energy will spread someday."
NBE05771,"I have heard a Japanese proverb, "" Penny wise and pound foolish. "" It means that the people who want to buy one as cheap as possible is likely to fail in shopping. Just for Japanese government, it can be said the same thing. The government decided to push the burning lots instead of nuclear plant. I think this decision will be cause big problem such as promoting global warming or blackout that happen in whole area in Japan. Japan has various natural power for energy, especially, geothermal have big power. Of course, it required many time and labor, but the government should invest to such powers for the future."
NBE06880,"When I was a high school student, I belonged to the newspaper club, so I have interviewed people who were from Fukushima. I realized that they tried to revive as hard as they could. I think what we should do is to know the present situation and think of the future in Fukushima. It is a true that Japan needs a lot of energy, but the most important thing is people's living safety and peacefully. The new energy comes into existence, however, there isn't enough it, so I think the government should provide the young with the opportunity that they could learn about the energy, disaster and future. I believe the young who are cultured may invent the sustainable energy in the near future."
NBE05626,"I think that if we can spend life without nuclear power, it's the ideal future. But now, there is no option other than nuclear power that is cheap, stable supply. So I agree with the Abe government's argument that returns to nuclear power. In any case, a proper reason is necessary to choose energy option, because we take responsibility for explaining it for the next generation. What we have to do now is thinking about how to provide a structure of mix energy in a good balance and hoping there will be large output from renewable sources in the future."
NBE07439,"I think that we should stop using the nuclear power. Because, it is too dangerous not only for us but also for people who will live in this world. Considering safety, we can not help doing it."
NBE07403,"I think nuclear power is so dangerous, but we will use this energy forever. Because prior to the Fukushima disaster nearly 3NA per came from nuclear. we Japanese depend on nuclear power. But, we should generate electricity in other way. Fortunately, there are many ways in Japan. I think we should take advantage of geothermal power. Many volcano are Japanese feature. For example, Norway has many huge dams and a plentiful supply of water, so there are many hydroelectric power stations. Japan should imitate this case. There are many negative points to build a geothermal power plant, but we ought to utilize this way."
NBE06604,"I think nuclear power is dangerous, but we should restart nuclear power plant. Japan will develop more and more in the future. We will reach the time that other energy can't provide Japanese society with electricity. No one have absolute safe way. We must be ready to choose a little dangerous way. This opinion applies to other field, for example, politics, economy and etc."
NBE06481,"I think that Japan should increase the supply of renewable energy. The generation of electricity by nuclear power is certainly efficient. However, from now on, it is very important to promote the use of renewable energy in consideration of safety. We must not forget the tragedy of the Fukushima disaster in March 2011."
NBE07371,"In terms of safety, shutting down all nuclear power plants is the best way. However, if we do so, we can't get sufficient energy continuously. After all, we must develop technology to generate electricity more stable than what it is, I think."
NBE07337,"I would like to know why Prime Minister Abe supports nuclear power so strongly. I have never heard of people positive about nuclear plants around me. At the same time, I wonder whether there are any problems with geothermal power suggested in the article. I believe Iceland, famous for the great hot spring called Blue Lagoon, exploits geothermal well. In Japan, there are some hot springs depending on geothermal as well, but it is not utilized to maintain our lives. I hope the idea of renewables will spread more."
NBE06420,"I think that the nuclear power is not reliable power, so I disagree the return to the nuclear power. Indeed, the nuclear power is the cheap big power. The point is fabulous. However, the people who live in Japan have threat of the nuclear accident. Therefore, I conclude that we should not make the nuclear power return."
NBE06758,"I think that nuclear power is a good way to generating electricity, but it is too dangerous. It can supply large amounts of electricity stably, but after the Fukushima disaster, not only Japanese but also the people in all over the world are afraid of danger of the nuclear power. I think nuclear power is no longer the best way to supply electricity."
NBE05840,"I believe the Japanese government and Japan's big energy companies should try to invent ultimate renewable energy producing system. At first, ultimate renewable energy producing system contribute to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, the Japanese government and Japan's big energy companies can earn big money. Environmental problems, especially global warming, are controversial in modern society. When they invent it, they can sell their technology to other countries. In conclusion, in order to contribute to stop global warming and promote the national interest, they invent ultimate renewable energy producing system."
NBE06009,"I agree with using the nuclear power . I know that nuclear energy has good points for example low cost and good for global warming . However, nuclear energy has bad points. For example danger for us. I concorded that points and I prefer before one because Japan desn't have a lot of money. So I decided that"
NBE06542,"I don't support the return to nuclear power. Although we can cheap and reliable power by the nuclear, it's very hazardous. Nevertheless, we have not been able to deal with spent nuclear fuels. And now, many anti-nuclear power plant movements are held not only in Japan but all around the world. So, Japan should develop the new ways of power generation right away."
NBE07247,"I think that to use nuclear power is good way to generate electricity, but it is too dangerous to keep for people of the world. And there are many energy sources in Japan, so we should to replace other energy."
NBE06639,"When I read this article, I was surprised to know there are many ways to generate energy in Japan. So, nuclear power in Japan should be banned because there are many earthquakes in Japan, so nuclear power is too dangerous. From this reason, I think Japan should use alternative way to nuclear power."
NBE06902,"I don't support to return the nuclear plants back on. That is because even if the nuclear power is able to generate the much electricity at one time than other power generations, it is so dangerous that I cannot believe it do no harm to people. Certainly, other power generations without the nuclear leave much room for improvement. But we should think of the priority of safety."
NBE06214,"Certainly, nuclear power is dangerous if we use it in an improper way, and I know the Fukushima disaster was a terrible one. However, considering the current situation in Japanese energy consumption, I think whether we can stop making use of nuclear power or not can only be guessed at. This is a difficult problem."
NBE06178,"Nuclear power is very useful. It don't discharge CO2 and generate a lot of energy. Administration think it is an ideal generation for Japan which has hardly resource. However, we should recognize risk of nuclear power and Japanese resource. Japan has a lot of nature and many hot spots. these will become hydropower and geothermal power."
NBE06932,"I think Japan has to continue to do without nuclear power. This is because, today, Japan has been suffering from radioactivity. And now, Japan has been coping surprisingly well without nuclear power, so we don't have to use it intentionally."
NBE06032,I think Nuclear power generation is very important for Japan now. This is because why I think like that is we cost much money and labor for generation. We can make power from Nuclear and it cost few amounts of money. Certainly if An accident happens of Nuclear power plant it must be Crisis for the human. Therefore human should more study about Nuclear and control it.
NBE05942,"I don't agree with Abe's plan to Turn the nuclear plants back on. Of course it is difficult to produce enough electricity for us to live without nuclear. however seeing the tragedy of Fukushima, we should think about the danger. also Japan has a lot of renewable energy sources. We should use these sources."
NBE07277,"Certainly, nuclear power is very useful. But we have to decrease it to protect human beings. The nuclear power can generate the energy easily . In this aspect, it is very good. But if the incident happens, for example Fukushima disaster, we can not do anything. So I think we must stop using nuclear power plant."
NBE07030,"I think that nuclear power plant must be shut down. Of course, without nuclear power plant, governments could not supply electricity adequately. However, if governments build sustainable power plant while they shutdown nuclear power plant step by step, they could supply power sufficiently."
NBE06515,"I think Japanese government should decide to make use of more geothermal power generations. Certainly, the nuclear power produce a good deal of energy cheaper than other renewable energy. However, we must have the risk of radiation accidents at the same time. On the other hand, Japanese people have been suffered from eruptions for a long time and there are many volcanoes in Japan. If we are able to make use of them efficiently, which will be Japanese strong point of making electricity and help us have comfortable life"
NBE05683,"The Abe government said that nuclear power was better than other power generation from the financial viewpoint, but I don't think so. Even if earthquake isn't occurred and don't cause nuclear power accident, it has been always had problem of hazardous chemical substances. The disposal of the waste needs technical way and there is few place that allow to bury these risky substances. Therefore I think nuclear power plant will actually make Japan's finance worse."
NBE05805,"I don't think we should be using nuclear power anymore, because It's obviously not good for environment and we haven't found the way we coop with those things after we used them. And as the articles says, we have lots of potential ways to generate renewable energy so we should make most of them. We should be responsible for not only us but also next generations."
NBE06146,"I think that it is not excusable to use nuclear power in Japan. The safer nuclear power is the desirable. However, it is accompanied by high risks and this is well known to us. That is why the Fukushima disaster in March 2011 was the greatest disaster Japan had ever experienced. We must never cause such the Fukushima disaster. But practically, today Japan's big power companies are faced with major risks and challenges. They should maintain a nuclear phase-out policy and promote the introduction of renewable energy more readily and willingly."
NBE06286,"I think nuclear plants are very dangerous, and restarting them is so scaring. Many people are suffered from radioactive and died of it. Even if nuclear power is effective energy source, I oppose running it. I hope more alternative energy appear in the near future."
NBE05706,"Nuclear power is very useful. But I think we should not too much rely on this power. Conversely, we should use this power to some extent for stable providing power. Of course, it I must be thought for risk and trouble. I think Japan should search for good balance to using balance between nuclear power and other safety energy."
NBE05735,"I know the damage of the Fukushima disaster is very terrible. For example, radioactive pollution and involving damage caused by a rumor is also big problem. Not only Japanese people, but also foreigners around the world were influenced and avoided Fukushima's food at that time or now on. However, I support a return to nuclear power plants. That's because the cost of thermal power generation oppresses Japan's finance. Besides, I think, the safety revel of nuclear power plant is being developed and terrible disasters are more controlled. But I also think, much renewable power which are ecological and a low cost will be used is the best."
NBE06063,"If the data in this article is all correct, I can't understand the intention of government. Everyone want to safety. We just need to use geothermal which is beneath us."
NBE06328,I think indeed unclear is need our life. But we should use to replace unclear energy.
NBE06361,"Many of Japanese people have thought that the nuclear power is so dangerous and it gives them the only bad influences since 2011. However, I think we cannot say that it is absolutely bad, because the Japanese people relied to be supplied with electric power by the nuclear power, so we could use electricity. In addition, I am from Tohoku, and I heard many opinions about the nuclear power after the Fukushima disaster. A half of them disagreed with a claim that all nuclear power stations should stop running."
NBE05096,"The Fukushima disaster reminds us of a risk of nuclear power. We depend on this power very much. The nuclear power is very dangerous. So, we cannot use it eternally. But, there is no energy to replace nuclear power absolutely. Now we cannot use the natural power as a substitution of the nuclear power. The Japanese government should find strong natural powers immediately. And we should have interest of this problems more."
NBE05377,"I felt nuclear power was dangerous and threatened people when the Fukushima disaster happened. And I think renewables to make energy of Japan are safer and reliable, so Japan should prevail them more by using efficient ways."
NBE05286,"Losing control of nuclear power caused the Fukushima's secondary disaster, so Japanese people think about renewables more. Certainly, there are many people who object to nuclear power, but Japanese government cannot help using it because other means are ineffective. We should consider whether nuclear power is really effective or not for Japanese people."
NBE05498,"I want Japanese government to be more think Japanese economic perspectives. We Japanese need grow our economic first. So, it seems that nuclear power is dangerous, we can't help but use it. I am one of the person who is suffer from nuclear radiation. In fact, people don't worry about it so much. Children play around outside. They have time limits though just in case. I want people who are from Futaba, Soma, and so on, go back their home, but Japan has to increase our economic development first."
NBE05122,"I think that nuclear power is so risky and we must be careful when we use it. The accident was caused in Fukushima in 2011. I felt so scared when I heard about the news through TV newses. Japan has other ways to create energy except nuclear power, so I want Japanese government to use safe ways."
NBE05305,"I think nuclear power shouldn't be used in Japan because of Fukushima disaster in 2011. In the accident, many people were scared by threat of nuclear. There are a lot of ways to make electricity. Safety way must be practiced. In other words, anyone must not threatened by power generation. I hope that good way of power generate will spread all over the world."
NBE05429,"I think that renewable energy is useful, but it may take many years for us to use renewable energy instead of nuclear energy. For example, geothermal power plant needs much money and extensive lands. Also, most of the plant is made by our national government, so the cost to made it is covered by our tax. Renewable power revolution is important, however, I think there ara lot of problems for the power."
NBE05357,"I think that the government shouldn't use nuclear power to produce energy because nuclear power is so risky. When I saw the nuclear accident in Fukushima, I felt the timing that we had to stop using nuclear power came. There are many kinds of natural powers to produce energy in Japan. We should utilize the each power, thinking about the merit or demerit of each natural power."
NBE06816,"I agree with your opinion. I think that we should find new power energy too, but these energies are limited. Considering nuclear power's merit, we have to solve this difficult problem ."
NBE06577,"Your suggestion about alternative energy is great. I thought that nuclear power generation should not be abolished, because alternative energy is not yet established. If a study on energy of ocean current advances, the nuclear power generation is not necessary. I hope the day when energy of ocean will come to lead the generation of Japan."
NBE07116,"I agree with your opinion. After Fukushima disaster, all people afraid of nuclear power. So, I think from now on we use renewable energy."
NBE05587,"Certainly the nuclear disaster in Fukushima was very pathetic, but nuclear power is very attractive for Japan. Since Japan has few natural resources, nuclear power energy is necessary. And nuclear power gives Japan a chance for having nuclear weapons. Today China is threating neighboring countries, so Japan need to reinforce the self-defense capacity. The issue of developing nuclear weapons should be worth discussing more ."
NBE05770,"I agree with your opinion. The Japanese government think only today's coping method, and they cannot make effort to improve energy system."
NBE05510,I thought that nuclear power should not be used when I read this article. but I knew that I could not say like that easily because Japan didn't have enormous energy instead of nuclear power.
NBE06723,"I agree with your opinion that we should stop to depend on nuclear power and think a good way to produce much electricity. Producing much electricity only by solar power is difficult. And depending on one energy is dangerous. So, we have to use many kinds of power. We should think many good ways of producing electricity."
NBE05864,"Nuclear energy is certainly efficient source that provides a great amount of energy constantly. But it is essential to take into consideration its danger. In fact, safety myth the government argued is out. We must pay attention to both positive and negative side of this energy."
NBE06901,"I agree with your opinion because I also think Japanese should know nuclear power has a danger. To realize our opinion, we should be interested in the problem about Japanese energy and make efforts to gain exact information."
NBE05863,"I agree with your opinion. Vows made in storms are forgotten in calms. We must not forget the memory of 3.11 and always pay attention to the news about nuclear power, getting information on our own initiative."
NBE07055,I agree with your opinion. The problem of the disposal of waste is serious.
NBE06446,"I agree to operate a nuclear power plant again. It is because the cost of the atomic energy import is cheaper than oil and gas for thermal power generation. In addition, Japan may fall into electricity shortage without nuclear power generation."
NBE05376,"I agree with you. Nuclear power reminds us of Fukushima's disaster, and it gives fear to people. As the article said, I think that geothermal power is good because it use natural power and is much safer than nuclear power."
NBE05334,"I think nuclear power is dangerous. In Fukushima, so many people were scared by threat of nuclear power. So we must be used safety power. For example, geothermal and so on. Now, Japan should develop that make other safety power."
NBE05331,"I tend to agree. Because I think nuclear power is dangerous. In Fukushima, so many people were scared by threat of nuclear power. So we must be used safety power. For example, geothermal and so on. Now, Japan should develop that make other safety power."
NBE05260,"I agree with your thought. The nuclear power is very dangerous. We use safety power. But, if we use only safety power -geothermal power without using nuclear power, we will run short of power. So this problem is very difficult."
NBE05394,"I have a same idea. When I first understood the Fukushima disaster, I felt scary and Japan should stop using nuclear power because there're many risks. We should think future power deeply."
NBE05396,"I think so too. There are a lot of nuclear reactor in Japan, but nuclear power is dangerous. So I think Japan should use another power. This problem is not somebody else's problem but our problem, so we have to think deeply."
NBE05393,I agree with your idea. Japan experienced the Fukushima disaster and reconsidered nuclear power's risk. We have to discuss which energy we use in the future deeply.
NBE06329,"I think so, too. Japan has constitution article 9. It is our constitution core. We should maintain this article."
NBE05285,I think so too. The fact that there are a lot of nuclear power plants is so threatened people especially who live near them. So Japan have to find renewables
NBE05284,I agree with your opinion. Certainly there are a lot of energy resources while Japan has many nuclear power plants. It is high time to consider our energy.
NBE05428,"I agree with your thought about renewable power, but there is a lot of problem to spread these power. So, I think the government should do the best to improve renewable power, but it is not done mind that this achievement become a little slowly."
NBE05332,I tend to agree. There are a lot of energy resources while Japan has many nuclear power plants. It is high time to consider our energy.
NBE05443,"Fukushima disaster. I live in Saitama, but I experienced such big earthquake for the first time. It isn't an earthquake that much damage was taken out certainly, by nuclear power generation. However, Japan has a little energy resource. Japan needs the power of the nuclear power generation to do the former cultural life."
NBE05445,I think so too. Japan needs using nuclear power. I believe the government will be forced to be available to the power.
NBE05231,I agree with your opinion. I don't want Japan to depend on nuclear power. I think it is scary because of the accident in Fukushima. Many people in Japan may also think about it. The government has to look for another way which can produce as many powers as nuclear plant.
NBE05467,"I can't forget the accident happened in Fukushima 2011. This year, many people injured and scared the fear of the nuclear power and some people suffering now. I knew the real danger of the nuclear power then. I think Japan should not use the nuclear power. There are many different ways to make electricity. The compatible of both of the safety and efficiency is difficult but we never bring such misery accidents 2011 in Japan. We would like to believe the government."
NBE05070,"I think solving energy problems is difficult for us, but we must solve the problem. I think we depend on nuclear energy temporary, but we should replace the power on renewable energy. It is hard way but we must do."
NBE06666,"I think so. Nuclear plans are cheaper than thermal plans. And they discharge lower carbon dioxide than thermal plans, but it's very very dangerous to use them. So we invent renewable energy as soon as possible."
NBE07301,"I agree with your opinion. The Japanese government has to focus on the development of renewable energy more positively. In addition, at the same time, I think what we should do first is the saving of electricity."
NBE06697,"There are two things that we have to think. First, many renewable energy resources cost very high. Its already very high in Japan and introduction of renewable energy bumps it. We are in dramatic competitive world. In much countries, electricity expense is lower than Japan. Especially, North Korea and US cost half as Japan. Second, nuclear technology is one of the highest technology now, and Japan has it. It's reasonable opinion that nuclear energy is dangerous, but it's not a smart way that stop and throw the nuclear energy. I think, Japan has to two things. First, developing good renewable energy cost reasonable price lower than thermal power plant. Second, developing safe nuclear energy."
NBE06695,"I don't think so. First, we can't build many geothermal energy plant in Japan because most of places where can build geothermal energy plant are in national parks. Second, nuclear technology is very valuable and stopping development costs high."
NBE06696,"I think your opinion doesn't reasonable. We can't stop spreading nuclear energy in the world. The number of Nuclear energy plants will increase 0.5 compare than 2011 (from IEA, 2012). Many of new plants will place in developing country. They really want to low cost energy resource and nuclear energy is almost only way to fill their demand. It's not a smart way that doing campaign to stop building nuclear energy. We have to develop safe nuclear energy as far as possible and build it on developing countries, first. And, at a time, we develop energy resources cost lower and lower. We have to do both of them."
NBE07465,"I agree with you. We have to stop using the nuclear power little by little. In order to that, we should consider about it more carefully."
NBE05534,"I'm all for your opinion. Surely, Japan has few resources, so if we can use renewable energy, the problem of electricity will be solved. And, nuclear power will be abolished completely."
NBE05533,"I think renewable energy is very important. It is safety for environment, and natural resources are not used. And also, by using it, nuclear power will be abolished completely. However, using it costs more money than usual. Solving the problem of electricity is not very easy."
NBE07370,"I agree with you. Now, it may be necessary for us to use nuclear power, but we should think about the way that we don't have to use it."
NBE06447,"I think so, too. We cannot but cover electricity with nuclear power generation until a convincing alternative energy to turn into nuclear is developed."
NBE05772,"I mostly agree with your opinion, but all nuclear power shouldn't be shut at the same time. To be sure, it's possible to stop the some of all. In my opinion, we are good enough developing stable and ecological power when some of all plants is shut."
NBE06603,I agree with you. Japan rely the nuclear power and it is rational.
NBE06757,I agree with you. I think increase of earthquakes make returning nuclear power more risky and make Japanese anxious too. Not only developer or government also we think about renewable energy.
NBE05304,"I agree. Nuclear power risks too much for us. Through Fukushima disaster, we grasped the fact that nuclear power generate might cause very dangerous accident. Japanese people have no reasons to persist only nuclear."
NBE06541,"I agree with you. Even if the nuclear power plant supply electricity cheaply, we shouldn't use it because we cannot quite control it with current technology. As you say, the price people in Fukushima paid in Fukushima disaster was too big. Japan should change the way to generate electricity for environment and ourselves."
NBE06480,"I think so, too. Japan should change the way to generate electricity because we don't have enough technology to use safely nuclear power at present. I hope our life that don't count on atomic power comes true some day!"
NBE07001,"I think your idea is best way. We must renounce nuclear power in accountance for Fukushima tragedy. But Now, Nuclear power accounts for 0.2 in Japanese electricity and Japan can't renounce nuclear power if future is like now. Therefore Japan must invent new energy."
NBE07000,"Before I read this comment, I thought Japan should promote renewable power but I didn't think about How to promote renewable power. Therefore Your comment show me how to promote renewable power."
NBE07056,"I don't think so. After Fukushima disaster, We can live without nuclear power. In Germany, 25% of all electricity is generated by renewable energy. After Fukushima disaster, German Government stopped about half of nuclear power station. And succeed in a revolution of generation. Japan should reform it now, too."
NBE06575,"I partly agree with your opinion. Indeed, nuclear power is terrible energy but if nuclear power generation is abolished, are there enough alternative energies. Unless alternative energies are invented, we cannot help but rely on nuclear power."
NBE07278,I agree with your opinion. Indeed nuclear power plant is very efficient to produce energy. It does not emit co2 so the plant is very environmental friendly. But we have to think about the dangerous. So I think the nuclear power plant have to be decreased.
NBE05943,I think we should think the way to produce enough power. However I think solar power is so weak that it can't make up with the nuclear power. .
NBE05682,"I cannot agree with your opinion. To be sure, Fukushima disaster was so terrible, but considering the fact that the population of Japan is very large but we have few resources, using nuclear power for electricity cannot be avoid. However, it is a different story that we have the nuclear weapons. To begin with, Japan promised the constitution to use nuclear power peacefully, in other word, Japan must not use this power as weapon. For this reason, I cannot agree with your opinion entirely."
NBE05841,"I'm for your opinion. I believe it is essential for us to spread renewable energy instead of nuclear energy. Also, the Japanese government must try to popularize renewable energy. the Japanese government has to set up infrastructure in order to use renewable energy in reasonable price for the next generation."
NBE06010,"I think so too. Renewable power is good for the earth, but it cost a lot of money to make many power bases. But we have responsibility that was have to save other animal, because we have broken the earth already. So it have to become truth immediately. I know it not easy."
NBE05915,Renewable energy will be more demanded in the future. This is because it is more safety for environment and nature.
NBE06177,"I think this article is good and very useful, too. The article say present of renewable energy and future of. It have classification of power generation methods. Based on this article, the dispute about unclear power will become revitalize and easy to understand."
NBE06784,"I partly agree with your opinion . Though it is true that nuclear power generation is very dangerous , the nuclear energy accounts for a lot of energy of Japan. So , I think that I cannot but depend on nuclear energy until renewable energy to turn into nuclear energy is discovered."
NBE06285,"I don't know for sure if your idea is correct, but it is true only geothermal power doesn't meet electronic needs."
NBE06360,"I think so too. Improving green energy is becoming important for Japan, because we knew the risk of the nuclear power by the Fukushima's accident and we were realized again the finitude of natural resources. We have to find other safer and more stable ways of electricity supply for the environment in the future."
NBE07219,I think this Abe's policy make a emotional dependence on nuclear energy. Japan has experienced many troubles related nuclear energy. This is the time to part from this dangerous thing like Germany.
NBE07087,"Nowadays, one of the biggest if not the biggest problem we, the human beings, are facing is global warming. Therefore, Japan, third biggest country in terms of economy, have to be a leader solving this problem."
NBE07085,"It is no doubt that the Fukushima nuclear disaster is one of the most disastrous incident which ever happened in Japan. I felt the feeling of both sadness and anger at the same time. I felt the anger towards the powerlessness of the government and myself. I is important to take actions, not become a bystander."
NBE07089,"The nuclear problem is one of the biggest problem we, the human beings, are right now facing. The dilemma between high energy efficiency and safety risk which make us puzzle about what should we do. It is very difficult to select one in this case. More debate and discussion are needed in the future."
NBE07088,The biggest problem of nuclear energy is its safety risks. Nuclear energy has not yet proven its safety to people. This is why there are counterforce which has grown and became a big group right now in Japan and all around the world. How to overcome the risks of safety is never-ending assignment for nuclear energy.
NBE07086,"Japan, third biggest country in economic way, has a responsibility of solving the world's common problem. Nowadays, one of the biggest problem in the world is environmental problem. Global warming has been spotlight for many years now in 21st century. Some countries came up with an idea of using nuclear energy which produces little amount of pollution with high energy efficiency. However, things always contains both positive and negative sides."
NBE06179,"People discuss about running unclear power generation but there is more important thing. It is to use renewable energy effectively. Renewable energy is good for environment and has possible. So, Japan should focus on renewable energy."
NBE07090,This news was shocking to me because Japan is believed to be a one of the best country with the technology of renewable energy.
NBE07083,"As a country which experienced disastrous nuclear plant accident, Japan should use this experience to make a wise decision. I cannot say whether banning nuclear plant is good or bad for Japan right now but I can say that this decision should be made carefully. Moreover, Japan will change drastically when the decision is made."
NBE07084,"I always wonder why nuclear plants are so huge in the size. I am sure that when the size has increased, the safety risk will increase too. Therefore, sizing down the nuclear plants can increase the safety of itself. If it is possible to down size the nuclear plants, at least some of the anti-nuclear groups will admit to compromise."
NBE06785,"When I read this article, I think it is true that nuclear power generation is very dangerous, but the nuclear energy accounts for a lot of energy of Japan. So, I think that I cannot but depend on nuclear energy until renewable energy to turn into nuclear energy is discovered."
NBE06514,"Certainly what you said is the right thing, but I think Japan cannot produce a lot of energy without nuclear power. I believe the cause of the nuclear accident is lack of preparations for big earthquakes and tsunami. The nuclear power generation is still necessary for Japan. I think Japanese government should make the best to find a solution."
NBE06933,"I think nuclear power is very attractive for Japan, too. We have to find alternative energy power"
NBE05202,"I think that the nuclear energy has merits and demerits. The quantity of its producing energy is large, but if it goes wrong , it will become a menace to Japan. In these days, potatos can be the energy like electricity, so it is good way to look for another technique of generating energy."
NBE06390,I think that nuclear energy is essential for Japan. Because we don't have the source of energy . We dosen't live without nuclear energy.
NBE06389,I THINK SO TOO. WE ARE SAID TO BE SAFE FOR A LONG TIME. BUT IT BECAMES CLEAR THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT ENERGY WAS danger. IT WAS REALLY SHOCKING TO ME.
NBE07336,I understand your opinion. We must get out of a paradox situation where people are dependent on nuclear power while nobody wants it in your neighborhood. But I wonder if it is possible because we do not know who and how it will be done. Japanese people have to think about this issue more.
NBE07029,I agree with your idea. Japan should solve this problem not only because nuclear power is dangerous and connote high risk but because Japan as developed country should be reader for environmental problem because of Fukushima accident. I think that government should show the world environment-friendly Japan.
NBE05354,I agree with you. I think Japan should depend on natural powers more.
NBE05358,I was also scared to see the accident on TV and I agree with you. Japan should not generate electricity by nuclear power.
NBE05355,I disagree with you because the nuclear power is too risky.
NBE05356,"I think also that the nuclear power has merits and demerits, however I think the power has more demerits than merits. Japan should not have the nuclear power."
NBE05201,"I think so, too. We should overcome this weak points. In these days , potatoes can be the resource of the energy like electricity."
NBE05200,I think so too. We have to live with nuclear energy. We should learn the useful and safety way of using nuclear power.
NBE05333,"I tend to disagree with your opinion. Because nuclear power is so dangerous. So people living where near the atomic power planet , they were under threatened."
NBE05497,"I am one of the person who is suffer from nuclear radiation. In fact, people don't worry about it so much. Children play around outside. They have time limits though just in case. I want people who are from Futaba, Soma, and so on, go back their home, but Japan has to increase our economic development first."
NBE05444,I tend to agree with your comments. The Japanese energy problem are serious. We should find the big energy which turns early in a nuclear power
NBE05121,"I agree with you. The Fukushima disaster made us good opportunity to think carefully about the energy and our safety. As you mentioned above, there is limit of natural resources, so we had better to use green energy."
NBE06330,I think unclear power is terrible. But people who lived there really is difficult life . Unclear power has a bad influence. Japan should not use it.
NBE05561,"I want to improve Japanese technology. However, I am worried about this improvement is too sharp."
NBE05071,I understand your opinion. I think so too your opinion and nuclear power is decreased slowly.
NBE07501,"Even the nuclear plants make huge amount of energy, I want to keep is shut down. Because there is one nuclear plant near from my hometown. Some people say that we can't live without nuclear power but I don't think so. I think there are many ways to produce energies and Japanese have potential to find some new ways because Japanese are very cleaver."
NBE07502,"I didn't know that potatoes could be energy. That will be the great way because it will not emit harmful gas or something bad for human being. This method might be used in the US, however, I don't think we have much potato in Japan to generate enough energy. But I think this kind of way to make energy is useful."
NBE07222,"This news is surprising. But the highest price of picture is ""Nafea faa ipoipo? ""pictured by Gauguin. Its price is about 300 million! I think this kind of money should be used for other constructive things."
NBE07468,"I was surprised to see this headline. I can't believe that some paintings and sculptures were sold at more than 100 million in recent years, and moreover, it's not those who love arts but the very rich that bought these artworks. I agree that the art market boom is all bubble that could burst at any moment. Now artworks play an important part in investment. However, it won't last too long, I think, because the thought that art's prices will rise resembles the myth that land prices will always continue to rise. So I think the art market will stabilize sometime."
NBE06968,"I was very surprised to read this article. I don't familiar with art and artist, so I can't understand why some people buy the work of art for such a too expensive price. I think they can use the money for doing something else. For example, they raise money for refugee relief. But the work of art perhaps have the reason why it is expensive."
NBE07338,"I cannot believe there are people buying a picture with millions of dollars. I think those art works should be kept in a good condition in a museum. In that way, many people can see it and it will be inherited to next generation. If I were a billionaire, I would donate money to developing countries rather than keeping one painting in my hand. I am not saying the painting is not worth the price, but in my opinion, people should share the valuable work in a public place such as a museum."
NBE05917,"I was surprised to read this article. I'm not interested in art , so I cannot understand why people want Picasso's picture to pay so much money."
NBE07372,"I agree with your opinion. I think so, too. These prices are too high for me to pay. I don't want to buy a Picasso for enormous money."
NBE07373,"Seeing this blog, my sense about value of art has been changed. I think that we may as well go to museums rather than buy pictures to enjoy works"
NBE05234,"I was surprised to read this article. I can't imagine myself buying an art with millions of dollars even if I were a billionaires. I want them not to buy an art so that we can see a lot of arts forever. In my opinion, billionaires should use their money for other aspects such as saving poverty."
NBE05307,"I can not believe that there are some pictures priced at million dollars. I can not judge the price is whether proper or not because I am not acquainted with art. But I feel the price of "" Women of Algiers"" . It is not good to preserve these famous and excellent paintings in private place of investors. Many people should be able to see these great arts. I think public museum should have paintings."
NBE07004,"I can't understand that Picasso's painting""Women of Algiers"" was sold in so high price. I think people who buy pictures in absurd price merely want to show their financial power and can't appreciate picture's real worth. This is why I am sad that such people monopolize valuable pictures and people who really have good taste can't see them."
NBE07003,I agree your opinion. I think these great arts are monopolized by only a people and other people can't see them
NBE06850,"When I heard this news, I think if Picasso live now, he can get much money. $179 million is extraordinary price for painting. I can't understand art so I wonder why common painting can get these extraordinary price. However, it is not good for general people because the arts got extraordinary price, general people can't look arts in museum. Museums can't buy the arts. It is my only fear."
NBE05168,"First of all, I was surprised at the sum of the bidding's beginning. It is so expensive so I realized that Picasso was one of the greatest artists again. Also, the auctioneers attempted to pay their large amount of money for pictures so I knew that there were a lot of art lovers around the world. Frankly speaking, I cannot understand the value of arts well so I had a doubt why they could pay a lot of money for a picture. Though, I felt that rich people using their money is good for economy. The circulation of money can perhaps make poor people a little richer. It is sad for us that we won't watch these masterpieces, but the problem of wage gaps is more important, I think."
NBE05685,"I'm not familiar with art, so I was very surprised that paintings are sold in so high price. Also, I felt it incongruous that state of economy influences on art. The equivalence of painting itself won't change, but price is easy to change depending on economy at the time. I think it is a pity that art is used as kind of a investment and people who really love art cannot appreciate the art."
NBE06102,"I was very surprised when I read this article and I had two opinions. First opinion is that it is waste of the money. There are many poor people in the world and there is the person who cannot eat food. There is the person whom it is awkward for that the world does not have money, so i think that the person who have a lot of money should save poor people. Second opinion is that it is important to save culture. If a picture sells only at a low price, painters are in trouble. The work of art is important for the history and culture. If a rich person pays a high price to a picture, the art becomes active. Therefore I think that it is waste of money, but it is important for save culture."
NBE06101,"I agree with you. Many people should see the historic painting. Particularly, it is agreement at the time to spend money for developing countries."
NBE07404,"I can't understand the art which prices $179 million. ""Women of Algiers"" passed the record of ""Three Studies of Lucian Freud"" in minutes. I am not familiar with arts, but I can guess Picasso's arts are so rarely and so expensive from this article. The problems that some of the world's greatest paintings are rarely and people who love arts can't see Picasso's masterpiece are so severe. I hope some methods of settlement. I think that only the richest can see the masterpiece is too bad fact."
NBE06667,"I don't understand billionaires accepted bids for ""A PAINTING"". Although Picasso is a great painter across the world, I wonder at the equivalent to the GDP of some island nations. In addition, Picasso's painting is human heritage. So a person shouldn't own it. People who want watch it should be able to watch it"
NBE06760,"When I read this article first, I was so surprised. I am not interested in arts, so I don't understand how much value Pablo Picasso's ""Woman of Algiers"" has. But I can understand the only one thing. That is waste of the money. I want those who have a lot of money to donate."
NBE06759,I agree with your opinion. I think such a thing is waste of money too. Those who have a lot of money should use it for society and the poor all over the world.
NBE06244,"I was surprised at a price of painting when I heard this news. I cannot imagine such a price concretely because it was far from our daily life. Therefore, I believe that painting should not be bought at too expensive price. To begin with, worth of paintings lies in technique, historic value and rareness. People who love paintings truly can evaluate true value without price. Market price should not be a criterion to evaluate the worth of art. In addition, using paintings as tools to produce money by private investors should not be allowed. Otherwise, public museums can't buy masterpieces because of its expensive price. It means someday we would lose chance to see them. All in all, because there are lots of faults to value paintings in price, we should not put an expensive price to paintings. I hope if private investors have much money, they should use their money for something to contribute to the society and get to be aware of genuine value of paintings instead of price."
NBE06579,"Through this article, I was surprised that works of art was so expensive. I think it is useless for private investors to spend much money on expensive works of art. Since I cannot understand good points of works of art, if I were billionaire, I would spend much money on more important things. Of course, different people have different values, but I wonder how private investors find good works."
NBE06726,"I don't know that the Picasso's painting was bought the most expensive in 2012. I'm surprised at the high price. It is difficult to understand worth of paintings. However people need to see and have knowledge of arts, because people should learn ideas of great persons. So it is problem that public museums can't keep up with private investors at recent auctions and they can't get the paintings. Public institute should act for that everyone can see famous paintings."
NBE07186,"Maybe some items are worth its price but it should not only depends on historical or technical value. Like the Picasso's work costs $179.4 million, it can be evaluated by our emotion, and we can perhaps adopt this mean of evaluation to the other items too."
NBE07185,I totally agree that it's pity that whether we can see valuable arts in public is dependent on the economy. Government or some institutions have to preserve our right to enjoy that culture of arts so that it encourages artists too.
NBE06243,I agree with you. People who have much money such as private investors should not only invest in their business but also contribute for the benefit of the society. I cannot understand for what purpose they invest huge money on such a painting.
NBE05146,"I was surprised to know the final price of the paintings equivalent to the GDP of some island nations. I feel the price of the GDP of nation should be higher than paintings. According to the last paragraph, almost people who really like art are not the rich. They feel to enter the museum is expensive. I think this situation should be changed. All people who love art should be able to see art easily."
NBE07249,I agree with your opinion. I think people who love arts are especially yearning see Picasso's masterpiece.
NBE06545,"I was very surprised to read this article about the inflation of the art market. To tell the truth, I can't appreciate art, especially surrealistic art such as Picasso. So it shocked me to realize that the painting had been sold at $179 million. I would like to see those paintings for which were bid a high price someday."
NBE07118,"I am belonging to orchestra, so I am interested in art. But I was surprised about Picasso's painting's final price. I think $179 millions is too expensive for Picasso's ""Women of Algiers"". Because Picasso's works of art is newer than other works of art. For example, Stradivarius and Leonardo da Vinci's works of art."
NBE05512,"I was surprised that Picasso painting sold for record $179 million. I can't understand the value of the picture. The reason why I think like that is that I am not interested in art. If I have $179 million, I will spend money on buying expensive clothes and eating high-class food. Will the day when I understand the value of this picture sometime come? . . . . This answer is no."
NBE05589,"The painting sold at a high price such as Pablo Picasso's ""Women of Algiers, ""Edvard Munch's ""The Scream, "" etc. is just a painting, I think. Monopoly of artworks and cultural heritages by the rich can deprive people who do not have money of opportunities to enjoy art and to acquire culture. In my opinion, billionaires should invest their wealth in education of children in developing countries. They are responsible for aiding people in need."
NBE06483,"When I read this article last week, I was really surprised at the final price of painting that was equivalent to the GDP of some island nations. I am not interested in too much paintings and have a poor knowledge of art. Therefore, I cannot understand why billionaires spend a lot of money on a piece of picture. It is very difficult to evaluate art and set the price because different people have different sense of values. I would like to see Picasso's paintings which have captured the hearts and minds of people around the world someday."
NBE06147,"I was very shocked to hear this news because I think that billionaires who buy masterpieces of art at auction personally behave high-handedly. Do they have the awareness to buy up splendid work of art? Maybe, they don't have them. If they were a member of people who love art purely, they should stop buying up them."
NBE05893,"I think that not private investors but public museums are appreciate to own paintings, because it can be studied further by specialists. The very rich should become a patron of the arts of young artists and support the development of the art world."
NBE05892,I agree with you. I not interested in arts very much. I think that probably the rich cannot understand the value of the art too. They just need something appreciate to invest their wealth.
NBE05807,I am surprised at this news too! I think you are saying right thing because it is impossible for art's price to rise forever.
NBE05806,"Even if I were a millionaire, I wouldn't use my money for just ""a piece of picture"". I don't understand why people want to buy them. In addition to that I don't think price in art market should be rising like this. This is SO insane. . ."
NBE05773,"I was very surprised to see this title. I think this painting's cost is too high. At the same time, I feel shock to hear that this soaring price cause the crisis for museum. In this article, it is said that billionaires are forced to buy a painting because the value of another is cheap for them. I think, in the future, our society will be controlled by a handful of billionaires, and the people who have a little money will be excluded. In order to avoid this situation, we should promote to share the famous works. If so, we will be more sensitive to art and we can improve ourselves more."
NBE06482,"I agree with you. I knew about the inflation of the art market for the first time when I read this article. In addition, I don't have prior knowledge to understand the value of those paintings, too. So I cannot believe that billionaires won a bid for a Picasso painting with $179.4 million!"
NBE07162,"When I say honestly, I can not understand how valuable this picture is. I usually see pictures on magazines, but I hardly see the pictures of the art which are displayed at museums. I want to understand the art, so I gonna mention much art."
NBE05651,"I think that even a picture of Picasso is too expensive. I do not understand the value of the picture. So, I do not know why this picture is so expensive. I think that I may do it more if I have $179.4. An individual often buys an expensive picture recently. I think that I want the art museum to buy it. After all I want to see the picture in an art museum."
NBE07441,"I don't have knowledge about pictures, so can not judge whether this picture is worth or not. However, I think that money used for pictures should be used for helping people . By doing this, many people will not be in trouble."
NBE05977,"I'm not interested in painting, so I can't believe this article. Value of things is different from person to person. But Picasso's arts are known as the wonderful arts to many people. It is awesome! I want to make something which get to recognize the value to a lot of people."
NBE06668,"I think so. It's too expensive. I don't understand why the cost of Picasso's painting is higher than One57 penthouse, 100m2 apartment in central New York."
NBE06363,"I do not understand the reason why some people want to buy those expensive pictures. Actually, Picasso's pieces are of great value. However, even if I know those are fully worth, I won't buy them. People have a different sense of value, so I understand that some of them find pleasure in collecting worth pieces. Nevertheless, I will save up money that some people use for pictures for a rainy day. In addition, I was reconfirmed magnificence of Picasso's pieces by this article."
NBE05975,"I agree with your opinion. I think there are a lot of paintings which are not known to many people. It's be very wasteful, not known to many people even if there is wonderful. So, I think painting industry should make an effort to have many people appreciate a painting."
NBE06362,"I agree with you. I also do not understand why some people spend their money on those pictures. However, I am curious to know an attraction of Picasso's pictures, too. Therefore, I wish I could see some of his pieces with my own eyes for once."
NBE05535,"At first, I can't understand this phenomenon. And I wonder why they spent so much money on buying a picture. This is why I have not been very interested in art. However, one of my friends are very fond of art, and he often go to museums. So I want to him to tell me the interest of art."
NBE05537,"Your opinion gives me a new way of thinking. In fact, only th rich can try to buy a precious picture like Picasso's picture."
NBE06818,"I am surprised at the price of Picasso painting, because I don't know art. I don't think the final price, totaled $179.4 million which is the equivalent to the GDP of some island nations is worth buying. Also, knowing the affairs of bank and museum , we need policies that the rich can use money more effectively."
NBE06881,"I have never known this trend, so I was very surprised to realize these art works are worth much. In fact, this trend have a bad influence, but I think it is very important to keep our history and civilization. I'm not familiar with art, however, I often watched and enjoyed the pages about art in my textbook when I was a high school student. What I learned at history classes is that art has been treated preciously and evolved with human beings. Therefore, the most important thing is to remember there wonderful achievements. I think as long as people discuss how to buy and display art works, real art worth doesn't disappear."
NBE06607,"This topic told me the current world of art. I knew many people who loves art can't see pictures and sculpture freely because a part of billionaire monopolizes them. If we should limit for billionaire to buy them and museum should make effort to attract general customers, art will be everybody's thing."
NBE06605,"I agree with your opinion. Many people is interested many fields, for example, art, music, sports, etc. We needn't change our interesting fields. But it is so important that we try to understand other fields because we need understand various world now."
NBE06516,"Actually, I didn't have so much interest in arts, so I didn't worried about such a state. Now, I believe what a few rich people keep these heritages is wrong. Certainly, due to the recession, it is difficult for banks to keep interest rates high. Also, museums can't afford to invest much money to gain arts. Therefore I think museums make an appeal for contributions to get valuable arts for appreciation, education and progress of society."
NBE06421,"I don't know feeling that I want to buy an expensive art. Indeed, reasons which the writer of this issue show us is reasonable. I understood that buying an art have great merits. However, I think that demerits is more than merits. I want to make my life safe."
NBE05629,"I think so! I understand the art contains important references to art history, but I can't understand the value of the art, so I can't believe Picasso's painting was sold so high."
NBE06904,"I'm sorry for everybody not to be able to look at arts which the popular artists such as Pablo Picasso painted. Certainly, the valuable arts are so expensive that not only the general public but also museums cannot afford to own them. But I think more people whether we have ample money or not should have opportunities to appreciate masterpieces. So I hope museums take steps to improve this situation"
NBE06422,"I think so. I think that money used for helping people is more valuable than money used for picture, too. Indeed, there may be value of pictures. However, things have the order. There should be actions which we must do earlier."
NBE05628,"I know there are many people who are interested in art, but I can't understand buying pictures so high price! In addition , if someone buy the important art and it is closed to private home , not only other people who want to see the art can't appreciate it for a while, the study of a painting is also behind . I think individual shouldn't buy the important pictures in terms of saving of arts."
NBE07405,I have the same opinion. Museums should improve this problem.
NBE06543,I agree with you. The price bid for Picasso's painting is not acceptable for those who are not interested in too much paintings and have a poor knowledge of art.
NBE06392,Those who buy too expensive works are very rich and they want to buy things any other people don't have. So picasso's painting was sold for $179 million
NBE06391,I think so too. I think that those who want to watch works can watch them
NBE05866,"I did not know about art the worth of picture well, but this archive is so interesting for me. Although the greatness of Picasso is widely known for his creative works, such as Guernica and so on, it is surprising news that his work was bought so high price as 1.79 billion dollars. I think money game by billionaire is even influence to artistic circles. The loss of masterpiece from public resulted from occupancy by the rich is unfortunate."
NBE05865,"I also surprised at this news. In my opinion, the rich who want to buy those expensive picture see them as not picture, but the way of investing their extra money which banks cannot offer. But when the masterpiece is stolen, they will lose great amount of money at a time. I think private investors should spend their money on immovable estate, such as islands."
NBE06013,"When I read this article, I was surprised . It is so expensive that I can't pay for them in my future. I think even if Picasso's painting it is just pictures! And I can't understand their worth . So I was surprised"
NBE06012,I think so too Because it's just pictures!
NBE07059,I cannot understand why they spend so much money for pictures and sculpture. It is too bad that people cannot appreciate it because a work of Picasso is kept in a personal house. So I think that individuals should not buy them for the other people who like pictures.
NBE07250,"I was very surprised when I heard this news, because I didn't know value of some paintings were more than 100 million. I couldn't believe it. But it is that many people are interested in these picture to be worth such. So I think these pictures should be seen at a public place."
NBE05843,"I was surprised at to hear the news. Although Picasso is very famous and great artist, the prices of his paintings are too much high. This is because works of art like Picasso's paintings become investments. Therefore, some masterpieces are invisible due to privately own. In order to appreciate works of art everyone, great works of art like Picasso's paintings should be owned by museums."
NBE06934,"I'm surprised at this news, too. I also can't understand why this picture was bought in such a high price. However, only Picasso can draw it. I think this is why it was bought in such a high price!"
NBE07033,I was surprised at this news and can't understand those who bought expensive paintings. I think that these masterpiece should belong to the country where artist was born and be preserved appropriately. Certainly art market boom have good impact on economy. However only the very rich benefits by art market boom.
NBE07032,I think so too. It is ironic that the rich's arrogance results in art market boom and positive economic effect.
NBE06181,"I can't imagine $179 million. I knew that investors bought arts for investment, but buying arts for investment isn't so good. Parts of investor don't understand arts. Moreover, there is danger of losing and burning historical important arts. So, museums in the world should have and take care of important arts."
NBE05684,"At first, I think the rich use their money for the poor. However, if they don't do direct actions like donating their money to orphans, buying paintings stimulates economy and makes the circulation of the money active. It can be said that this action also contributes to the poor."
NBE05945,I was surprised to read this article. I am not interested in art so that I can't understand the price and the man who bought it . I think it's a waste of money.
NBE06182,"I think so. Wealthy people should have responsibility as having man. For instance, they contribute local community, do fund raising and think better society. If they couldn't do so, they would have no right to have wealth."
NBE07282,I was surprised at the news. Because I am not interested in painting. I have no money to buy the painting and I can't understand the worth of the painting.
NBE06331,"First I was surprised to hear the news. Because I didn't believe that the painting is very expensive. If I was a billionaire, I don't use money to bid the painting. Well I don't interested in the painting. Anyway I hope that billionaires should use money in another way"
NBE07279,I agree with your opinion. I can't understand the worth.
NBE06034,"I was surprised to hear this news very much. It is because I can't understand why paints are made a deal at so high price. Certainly, I think the paints are very important to study the history and culture. But the high price make difficult to study easily. I think it is also very important thing to see and study it easily. If the rich buy up these we will not be able to see these and it is very sad, I think."
NBE06332,I think so too. Some people who have much money should use it something else.
NBE06033,"I think so, too. I can't understand why the paints became so high price. Billionaire must not buy up these and they have to show the paints everyone who wants to see."
NBE06217,"I know there are various ways to use money, and many rich people wanting to spend theirs on something valuable in terms of art. However, I still can't think the picture is worth the price. It's too high."
NBE05737,"I can't understand why the picture was bought by so expensive price. However, I think art should be understood and respected. If there is no art, our lives are very simple and are not interesting. So, I'd like to learn art and the things which attract us like art (music or literature or . . . ) and understand the reason of the expensive price."
NBE06642,"When I read this article, I was surprised to know that there are many people who pay much money to buy expensive art works. I can't understand why they are attractive. And I think present auction system makes important artistic works invisible to public. This may lead studies of artistic works hard."
NBE06215,"I also think the price is too high, and precious art works should be open to the public."
NBE05736,I agree with you about the idea these pictures should be publicized.
NBE06640,I agree with your opinion. I think government should support museums to be able to obtain worthy artistic works.
NBE06288,"I think it is too expensive to buy the picture. If such pictures are kept by billionaires who are small percentage of all people, it is a pity that most of the people cannot look at them."
NBE06788,"When I read this headline , it is surprising for me that Picasso's masterpiece is more expensive than I think . But , when I finish reading this article , I understand the reason of the high price because I know that Picasso's masterpiece contains more references to art history than most college courses ."
NBE06787,"I am not interested in painting and can't understand the worth of the Picasso's painting , too."
NBE05707,"I have known that Picasso's pictures are high. But I think it's too expensive. Even if I have read this article last week, I couldn't understood people who pay the too high cost for this paint."
NBE06517,"I also think what millionaires use their money to monopolize human heritage is wrong. On the other hand, I can understand their feelings, that is to say they want to increase their fortunes, so they buy expensive arts and keep them to sell at higher price in the future. I believe that the millionaires will donate that money which they'll increase to common good."
NBE06519,"I also think what millionaires use their money to monopolize human heritage is wrong. On the other hand, I can understand their feelings, that is to say they want to increase their fortunes, so they buy expensive arts and keep them to sell at more high price in the future. I believe that the millionaires will donate that money which they'll increase to common good."
NBE06065,"I fully realized that each has one's own value. We don't want to pay $179 million for a picture. But, someone paid it in fact. Apart from whether or not I will be a a billionaire, I'm wondering that I can't find something I want to pay $179 million. Will I be able to meet such a value for me?"
NBE06448,"I do not have knowledge about the art very much. Therefore I do not know why some people pay high money to only one piece of picture and obtain it. However, I think that I want them to inherit it carefully because the old picture has serious historic significance."
NBE06064,"I can't imagine that, neither. But, I think everyone can use their own money for their own desire. Of course, volunteer is a one virtue."
NBE05289,"I had heard this news on TV, but I didn't think there was potential that people couldn't appreciate Picasso's painting. The very rich should invest in other thing so that people can appreciate a lots masterpiece. And I'm afraid of that a bubble of art market burst suddenly."
NBE05205,"I think that it is good idea that the billionaire buy costly paintings, because it dynamizes the economy. There are some people who suppose that historical heritage should be kept in museums, but I think that almost all collectors deal with them carefully, therefore, no worrying for inheriting them."
NBE05400,"I was very surprised at this news and this unbelievable price. In this material, it is said that Billionaires increasingly own international politics and cultural heritage, but I think these masterpieces should be exhibited for not only billionaires but also ordinary people. If so, we can share the value of these pieces."
NBE05123,179 million is so expensive! I can't imagine such a high price. I think people tend to be not able to judge calmly especially about their hobbies like art.
NBE05359,I cannot imagine myself buying artworks in such a extremely high price. I feel it is not good for the very rich to buy up precious artworks because arts shouldn't be owned by only the rich. Everyone who loves art should own precious artworks.
NBE05379,"I don't have sense of art, so I don't know why Picasso's works are so high costed. But I think it is not so good for famous and valuable art works to be rarely shown to public view because they give impression people."
NBE05233,I agree with you. Precious artworks should be owned by art lovers. They must want to get the art the most. Billionaires should yield to the people who like the art sincerely.
NBE05124,I agree with you. I also cannot imagine such a high price. And I think that these famous picture should be saw by not only rich people but also other people.
NBE05169,"I was surprised at the sum of bidding, too. I also agree your opinion about the sharing of the value of world masterpieces. On the contrary, I thought that auctions by rich people were continued because of money circulation. I hope that the billionaires who own international politics and cultural heritage will hold their exhibition for everybody."
NBE05262,"I agree with your opinion. I also cannot understand value of Picasso's arts. But many riches want to buy it. So it is very valuable, I think. But, I think there is many poor people around the world too. So I think that rich people should spent money for poor people."
NBE05263,"I cannot understand the worth of Picasso's masterpiece. Because I wonder that anyone can draw arts like that. But the price of art is 179 million. So I think people who understand the beauty of the art want to get this for a large amount. Picasso is known all over the world, so everyone know his name. So I think his art is very valuable for just him painting. By the way I don't want his arts for expensive price."
NBE05306,I agree with you. Preserved excellent art works by private investors must be the cause of luck of art works that many students study arts with. I think famous art works should be on display at public museum. There are many people who have not so much money to by some art works but want to see them
NBE05398,"I agree with your thought. Everyone has own values, so so someone who understand the beauty of art will want to get this art. I think it is good for us to try to appreciate pictures in order to widen our vision."
NBE05469,"I'm very interested in Picasso's picture. It has a power to tell us about the history or culture at that time , so I understand it became very high price but I think billionaires should spend money more on the other thing. If it was not so expensive, we could appreciate the picture of Picasso or a lots of master pieces. It is important that we understand the worth of historical painting and learn history."
NBE05468,I agree your opinion. It is not good thing the study of paintings is behind by someone bought the important art. I think we may be able to share the worth of the painting.
NBE05145,"I agree with your opinion. I also felt the cost is too high. Your idea which solve the problem is good. To promote to share the famous works is very important for us. I think how we can promote to share the famous works. However I cannot give a concrete example, we should try to think about the way which to share the famous works."
NBE05098,"This article is difficult for me to understand. Picasso painting is sold for $179. In other words, the painting has so high value. But, I don't think that it is worth. Art is savored deeply."
NBE05097,"I think so, too. I can't believe that the Picasso painting has so high value. I want to know the real worth of art in the future."
NBE05039,"I haven't bought any works and haven't experienced any auction so this article was new for me. Richest people can use their money freely, however, I don't know is it the best way to spend their money."
NBE05336,I'm interested in Picasso's picture. This picture has a power to tell us about the history or culture. I understand it is very high price but I think billionaires should spend money more on the other thing. It is important that we understand the worth of historical painting.
NBE05447,"I was surprised at the article. Picasso is too famous. Surely I know him, but I can't understand his works. I think those who buy his works is stranger."
NBE05335,I tend agree. I think to.
NBE05074,The news surprised me. I can't understand why these people buy the picture that is so high cost
NBE07058,I agree with you. The valuable work should be inherited forever.
NBE05397,"I agree with your idea. I think it is good to show these historical paintings for public. If so, not only rich people but also other people can enjoy these paintings."
NBE05399,"I think your idea is good. If so, everyone can view paintings and learn art. I don't have sense of art too, but I would like to enjoy these paintings."
NBE06725,"I agree with your opinion. I think it is too expensive and I want to see the picture in an art museum. It is need that people see famous painter's pictures, so museums have to make efforts that they get them."
NBE06903,"I think that billionaires should have the right of buying arts freely. But like your opinion, I want to see the invaluable arts and get the opportunity to be able to enjoy arts such as the museums."
NBE07440,"I also agree with your opinion. It is important to defense arts, but this price is too large."
NBE05204,I agree with your idea that you want the rich to inherit pieces of pictures which has historic signature carefully. It is the most important that historical pictures will be kept in safe.
NBE05652,"I think, and I approve of yours. Why will this picture get such a high value? I cannot understand that I buy a picture paying money so much. I buy it if cheap. . ."
NBE05287,I agree with your opinion. Very rich should buy the paintings not for themselves but for everyone. It is when many people see it that the painting is valuable.
NBE05288,I can't imagine such money too. Very rich have so much money that they can monopolize the historically painting!
NBE05378,I don't also know why Picasso's work is so high. But I think it is bad for valuable works to disappear back into private places because there are people who really want to see and enjoy works.
NBE05430,"I don't surprised at this article. Art cannot be priced by one, but it can be done with a lot of people and their competitive spirit, I think."
NBE05431,"Prices for items are sometimes decided not by historical value or technical value but by our emotion everywhere. This is natural thing, but we cannot feel this in our life."
NBE05446,"I think a billionaire would like to be probably proud. He hopes the surrounding person will be surprised by his buying something no one can buy. When something he'd like to buy is expensive, so I think it needs to be Picasso's picture."
NBE05040,I think so too. It is good thing that the famous works were bought by billionaires. There are no relationship between the owner and the value of the painting.
NBE05038,"I agree with you! If I had so much money like the billionaire, I will use it for donate. It is better to use money for someone."
NBE07091,This news was kind of interesting but not valuable for me. I am not interested in any arts but the price of Picasso painting is astonishing. I wonder if it really has that much value.
NBE06698,"The active situation of art market is welcome news because the entire growth of art auction market is good for artists. For new comer artists, the valuation at auction has huge importance. It shows how they judged."
NBE05536,"I was surprised at this news, too. I've been interested in art, so I can't imagine the feeling of the rich spending much money on arts. However, this is the rich that circulate economy."
NBE06099,"I agree with you. I cannot understand why people want Picasso's picture to pay so much, too. However rich people is enviable."
NBE06100,"I agree with you. I was very surprised when I read this article. I think that reach people should use their money for other way. For example, to save the people of developing countries. We should think about usage of the money."
NBE07220,I agree with you. They must have responsibility people who own much property.
NBE06216,"I don't think so. There is no right needed to have more money than others do, and no way to spend money is morally better than other ways are."
NBE06218,I see your point. I also think the current situation where only rich people can fully enjoy this kind of art is not desirable. Who can buy art?Who can own?
NBE07467,"I was also very surprised to read this news article. Some people who buy the work of arts for such a too expensive price regard the work as the way of investment, I think."
NBE07303,"I think the fact that billionaires buy and own valuable pictures is not blameworthy thing in itself. Because there is no rule to prohibit from doing so. However I can't understand their senses of values to pay millions dollars for a painting. I think there is another better way to use them. In addition, even if the billionaires buy famous paintings, I want the billionaires to provide the general with public periodic opportunities to put the masterpieces on view."
NBE07304,"I think the fact that billionaires buy and own valuable pictures is not blameworthy thing in itself. Because there is no rule to prohibit from doing so. However I can't understand their senses of values to pay millions of dollars for a painting. I think there is another better way to use them. In addition, I want them to provide the general with public opportunities to display the masterpieces"
NBE06449,"I was surprised, too! If there is the money for it, do you want to spend it for other things?"
NBE07161,"I also think much money has other ways to be used for. However, though I don't know the worth of arts, they may have something which fascinates people."
NBE05125,"I agree with you. I also cannot judge whether it is reasonable of too expensive because I have poor knowledge about the painting. And as you wrote, I think many people should see these paintings freely."
NBE06544,"I agree with your opinion. If buyers are really like want paintings, it is no problem."
NBE06606,"I am impressed with your opinion and agree with you. Until I read it, I didn't understand this picture's value. Because I didn't think this picture's side as history. I think we should spread cultures and what they tells. The riches shouldn't keep it to themselves."
NBE06242,"I agree with you. I'm interested in pictures such as Picasso, too. I hope billionaires and private investors should understand the real worth of art instead of the worth for investment."
NBE07119,"I think so too. If I start work very hard now, I can not pay for this picture."
NBE05511,"I agree with your opinion. I think to spend money to buy expensive arts is not necessary, too. Like you said, the money should be used by other aspects. I think billionaires should donate money to developing countries."
NBE05627,"I agree with you up to a point, but I think how to use money is the right for each person. So rich persons needn't use their money for charitable work, but their money shouldn't be used contrary to the public profit like the study of Picasso's painting in this case. They need think carefully about the effect of using their money by situation."
NBE07281,"I think we have to have an interest in the art. I agree with your opinion. In a leisure time, I want to go to the museum."
NBE07280,"I agree with your opinion. People who have much money should help poor people first. But, as we spend our money as we want, we can not decide how other people spend money."
NBE06578,"I was surprised at the price of paintings. I cannot understand their purchasing will. The boom is transient. It does not last for a long time. I think it is no use investing paintings, but the boom may support economy."
NBE05976,"I disagree with you, because I think that we don't have right to interfere in other people's hobby."
NBE06819,I think so too. I don't know the painting's value. I think there are other ways to use a lot of money like donation.
NBE06518,"I agree to almost all of your opinion, but I can guess why billionaires spend a lot of money on these pictures. Perhaps, they want to add to their fortune, so they want to invest in something. However, because of the recession, if they invest in, they may not be able to make a profit. That's why they buy those pictures for high price and they'll keep those till pictures' values become higher."
NBE07283,"It is very difficult to know the value. If I had much money, I would not buy such a thing"
NBE05944,I agree with you. I cannot understand why some people buy this for such a expensive price.
NBE05842,"I agree with this idea. Great art works should be kept in suitable conditions like equipped museums. Moreover, they should be inherited to the next generation. For the purpose, I strongly think that we try to avoid investing in great art works in order to keep them good conditions in the future."
NBE07187,This's because of its historical value that the price is so expensive. We have to preserve arts from decay and it is not easy to do for ordinary people. Then museums try to save it or some rich do that. They also do it maybe for their contentment.
NBE05916,I don't think so. This is because people have rights to do so.
NBE06011,"I agree with your opinion. If I was rich man, I didn't buy any expensive picture. Because it just picture. But I know people who are rich have a right can buy expensive picture."
NBE06180,"I agree with. I am not interested in arts, too. However there are more better how one parts with their money and they should change it. I think donate and thanks to special person for them is good how one parts with their money."
NBE06786,I agree with your opinion. I also think that I should make use for next-generation activity by sharing a valuable thing among many people.
NBE06287,I somewhat disagree with your idea.
NBE06641,I agree with your opinion. Paying money to expensive art is waste of it. We should use money for other activities such as volunteer activities.
NBE07339,"I got your point and agree with your opinion to use those money for other things such as donation. But, at the same time, I think somebody must keep valuable paintings for the next generation. According to the article, billionaires seem to be the best buyers. Thus, maybe they can cooperate with museums to make public people enjoyable."
NBE07221,"Letting heritages showed to people has good effect and cause bad effect. ""People"" contains many kinds of human. If who shows those great works can not protect them from some shameless persons like thieves, they should be kept in rich men's storeroom."
NBE07248,I agree with you! I think there are many people who want to see an art and look forward to see it. So billionaires should not monopolize. Poverty should be saved!
NBE07092,"To be honest, I am not a paint lover. So I don't go to museum very often. However, how much a simple paint can cost is just stunning. I know the name ""Picasso"" but I don't find any attraction in his works. I doubt when people claim that his painting is awesome. I believe that the high price of famous painting is the result of a money game by billionaires who try to show off their wealth."
NBE07093,"When I first saw this news, of course I was surprised by the crazy price of a one single piece of painting. I was also surprised by the power of brand. I am very sure that if this painting was sold without the name of ""Picasso"" it won't worth more than $5NA. The power of brand made this unbelievable price which also give people a dream."
NBE06935,"I think so, too. Those who have great talent have to be saved by states, and we look up on them."
NBE07031,"I agree with your idea. There is reason that billionaires should provide the paintings. They can buy and sell freely. However, these paintings is valuable thing for human. i think that billionaires should care about this thing."
NBE05361,I was also surprised and I agree with you. There was another way to use the money.
NBE05360,"I think so, too. I'm never familiar with art, so I can't understand the value of the works."
NBE05203,"I agree with you. I am not interested in art, so I do not understand why people want to buy Picasso paintings by paying so much money, but I think it activate the economy."
NBE05499,"It seems that there are particular about the paintings. Since I'm not good at paintings(I actually terrible at paintings), I don't know why people want Picasso's painting even though they pay a lot. But It's because I don't have any knowledge of how Picasso is great."
NBE05562,I cannot believe why this painting is so expensive. I don't want buy never.
NBE05072,I agree with your opinion. I surprise to read the article.
NBE05073,I think so too. I can't understand what wealth people think.
NBE07224,This kind of tolerance may be necessary for public event in Europe because the number of homosexuals seems relatively large.
NBE06970,"When I read this title, I couldn't understand what it was. But as I read this article, I thought it was wonderful for everyone to think about homosexuality. Some people aren't willing to recognize homosexuality, but it is an age when there are many gay or lesbian in the world. So I think we can't discuss many things without them now. I think Japanese has the prejudice why they love same sex. So Japanese should recognize them and have the attitude which encourages homosexuality. From now on, their right will be guaranteed immediately."
NBE06821,"I think that the movement that the minority like homosexual is received in everyday reality will be needed as time passed, this example is the first step to promote tolerance. In Japan, same-sex marriage was accepted at Shibuya lately. From now on, we should spread these movement."
NBE07007,"I think that we should more actively promote movement as homosexual being accepted. I think that now, many people accept homosexual. However most of them don't want to discuss this subject aggressively. Therefore accepting homosexual have not been prevalent. Let's discuss accepting homosexual."
NBE07376,"It is good for emphasizing equality between normal couples and others to take the measures, but I think we don't have to use icons of a couple in traffic signals."
NBE07121,"When I read this article, i couldn't understand immediately. Because gay culture is not received perfectly in Japan. Many gay TV celebrity are succeeding in Japan. So if Japan import this traffic signals, we will be tolerant about gay culture."
NBE06246,"I was surprised to hear this news because I didn't have such an idea as gay and straight traffic lights. Also, I was astonished to know Vienna are generally positive about new traffic light. However, in Japan, I believe that most people may not be positive to set up these traffic lights in the city. Recently, Shibuya Ward decided to issue the Partnership Certificate to the same-sex couple. I'm not familiar with such movement. But, we should accept this movement for mutual understanding and happiness of our society."
NBE05290,"At first, I couldn't believe the traffic lights exist in the city. It is difficult to judge whether the idea is right or not. Certainly, many people tend to be positive about homosexuality in recent years, but there are the objection. Although there are many kinds of opinions, it is the homosexual's opinion that most important."
NBE06762,"I was surprised at this article when I read it. I think homosexual is received gradually in many countries, but Japan has a sense of discrimination for homosexual. We should promote the movement that homosexual being received all over the world like 'gay and straight' traffic lights."
NBE05338,When I read this title I was surprised . This article is about homosexuality. Some people aren't willing to recognize homosexuality. I think that Japan must think about a homosexual than now. Japan should recognize the homosexuality properly. I strongly think that it should allow you to live without being discriminated even if homosexual.
NBE07470,"Installing 'gay and straight' traffic lights is a good idea, I think. These days, gay isn't out of the ordinary any longer. More and more people should accept them, and we shouldn't discriminate between gay and straight. 'Gay and straight' traffic lights are the first step for equality and equal treatment. That's why I think we ought to spread this trend."
NBE05126,"I was surprised by this news because I have never seen such signals. But I mainly agree with this topic because I think it is good to promote same-sex couple. I think it is wrong to give equal right not only to straight couples but also gay couples. I also think that it is not good to have bad image based in their race, nationality, and sex. I want Japanese government to install signals like Vienna."
NBE05236,I was surprised to see this article. I have seen only the traffic light with a man. I think it is a good idea. It will amaze me when I wait the light changes. Furthermore It means the society allows same sex couple. I want Japan to install this traffic light.
NBE05148,"This traffic lights show our modern society. Recently, in Japan, the issue of gay and straight attracts our attention. But in Japan, we can not see and feel concrete activity which linked to those people. So when I read this article, I thought Japan should do an action recommending such people like a foreign country. I feel Japanese people have to try to think about this issue more seriously from now on."
NBE05590,"The world is changing. Should Japan also change in terms of tolerance of same-sex marriage? I disagree with approval of same-sex marriage for some reasons. It is true that some people say that same-sex marriage is an individual problem so a definition is legally necessary. However, Japan has a tradition that people regard their family very highly. If same-sex marriage were legally allowed, Japanese family system would be destroyed. Should Japan accept ""global standard"" without criticism? I don't think so. In addition, most Japanese people are biased toward same-sex couples. Whether same-sex marriage is approved or not, same-sex couples will be permanently prejudiced in Japan. Same-sex couples had better leave Japan. Therefore in Japan same-sex marriage should not be legally allowed."
NBE05403,"When I first read this article, I was surprised because I have never seen these traffic lights. Recently, I think these couples are gradually accepted in the world, so I think it is good to set up these traffic lights. However, technically speaking, we Japanese aren't sensitive these various couples, so I think it is important for us to understand them."
NBE05740,I think so too. I expect people accept this idea and epochal action in Japan.
NBE05776,"Today, there is a various kind of love such as gay. For them, prevailing the thought that such a kind is popular is important. Of course, we must think the demerit of this. For example, gay couple cannot birth their child. In particular, in today's Japan, low birth-rate is one of the social problems. For the benefit of group, we shouldn't promote this campaign."
NBE07341,"I have never heard of the idea of gay traffic lights. I think it is a great idea because I can think of no negative points trying this. I agree with the voices of people on the street in this article. I also believe this idea should be considered in Japan as Shibuya, for the first time in Japanese history, allowed same-sex marriage recently while most people seem apathetic. I hope these sexual problems will be discussed more in Japan."
NBE07060,"Homosexuality begins to be accepted now in the world. But in Japan, the problem about the homosexuality is rarely taken up in the media. So, this idea is good for Japan because people become able to think that homosexuality is not a special thing. But I want Japanese government to use the tax for a more important thing, for example, social-security, the low birth rate, electric generation, and so on."
NBE07306,"I've never seen such a interesting traffic lights that arouse my curiosity strongly. Although Austria's Freedom Party make an objection to them, I agree with these designs. As the article says, the 'gay and straight' traffic lights will make people pay more attention to traffic safety as well as take more interest in homosexuality and equality. That is killing two birds with one stone. Especially, amid the progress of diversifications of values, I think we should turn our eyes towards the matter of human rights for gay people earnestly. So, I think that designs are very nice."
NBE05265,"I think it is good idea that gay traffic lights are fit up. Some country meditate the problem about homosexuality and take action. In Japan, I sometimes watch a news or program about homosexuality on TV. But, everyone don't think seriously about it. But, there are gay and lesbian in Japan too. So, we should understand homosexuality and take any action to save them."
NBE05264,I have never seen these traffic lights too. So I was surprised when I read this article. There are seldom gay or lesbian around us. So it is quite difficult that we understand them. But I think it is important to understand them.
NBE07253,"When I read this article, I was very surprised, because I have never seen such traffic lights. And I think that it is good way in order to think about homosexuality. In Japan, I've watched homosexual people on TV, but I didn't think seriously about them. So I think we should introduce this idea."
NBE06105,I think that it is very interesting idea. I want to look at such a signal in Japan. The problem about sexual become more serious. Recently same-sex marriage came to be accepted abroad. The problem about sexual is apt to be avoided in Japan. However we should think the problem about sexual. I strongly believe that we should make tolerant society about the sexual.
NBE06103,I agree with you. I think that Japanese government should make tolerant society about the sexual. The Japanese should get rid of prejudice. Each one should think about sexual.
NBE06245,"I agree with you. In Japan, minorities had been ignored. So that, we should accept diversity in every field such as sexuality."
NBE05401,"I agree with your idea. We Japanese are insensitive about this issue, so we should try to understand them and discuss whether Japan install these signals or not."
NBE05402,"Me too. I have never seen these signals and I didn't know these signals were existing. When I first read this article, I was surprised, but I think these diversity is good and we should try to understand these issue."
NBE06582,"I think that it is good idea to make people think about same-sex couples. Since homosexuals appear in a program as an entertainer, Japanese people are tolerant of homosexuality. It is important to promote tolerance and the idea that same-sex couples are a normal. Many countries should install traffic signals like Vienna."
NBE06580,I agree with you. We should pay attention to the issue of homosexuality.
NBE06852,"When I heard this news, I think this is very interesting tackling. Recent years, it is more important about the equality and we have to be anxious about the minority. This tackling is the one way of keep equality and reform of peoples consciousness. I want to try this tackling in Japan too."
NBE06486,"It was not until I read this article that I knew 'gay and straight' traffic light in Vienna. I think this idea is very unique. In recent years, homosexual problem has been accepted gradually around the world. Also, countries that legalize same-sex marriage is increasing. However, it is not legal in Japan at present. I think Japanese government should promote these movements more than now. And we must deepen our understanding of the homosexual issues."
NBE06727,"I was surprised at this article title. I couldn't image of gay and straight traffic lights at first. But I think this signals are good, because it is possible to attract attention of pedestrians and driver to traffic signals. So it can reduce accidents. And also, people will be able to understand about gay more and more."
NBE05514,"There is a prejudice against homosexuals in Japan. In fact I also, but one person to have a prejudice. I know that since the rights as a person is in everyone equality, it's free to become who to love. But I think that there is still resistance against homosexuals. In order to eliminate this feeling also, the movement held in Australia is very effective. By the government to represent the attitude that accepts gay, prejudice against homosexuals will fade."
NBE05631,"I think this idea is efficient because it is good for not only attracting the attention of all road users, but also promoting the idea that same-sex couples are a normal. However, seeing these traffic lights only once time is not radical solution for prejudice of same-sex couples. To think same-sex couples normal, we need to see such couples as much times as different-sex couples in our life. But the number of same-sex couples is small, so the spread of these traffic lights is necessary for our equal life."
NBE06521,"When I read this article at first, I remembered the news that same-sex couple's marriage is admitted in Shibuya. However, I think an understanding for that trend is not popular in Japan and it takes time to spread to the whole Japan. In my opinion the movement for encouraging gay people is a good idea in equal treatment. I want this action spread in Japan, too."
NBE06882,"I think it is very important for everyone to think about same-sex couples. Recently, I often hear about the system that same-sex couples could live comfortably. In my high school days, one of my classmates was a homosexual person, but he didn't hide the truth and we never discriminated against him. I think he was proud of himself. Everyone's having their pride is very necessary to live in this world, so I hope to establish more the system that not normal couples but also same-sex couples could live comfortably."
NBE06014,"I agree with this opinion . When I have been to Brighton in England , i feel something which like freedom . I am not gay but Ifeel that Brighton was comfortable for everyone. Even if women, men, normal, abnormal, young, old, people!"
NBE05381,I felt that the idea of installing gay-themed traffic lights is very interesting because I have seen traffic lights that are only red and green. And gay-themed traffic lights are good to tell people that same-sex couples are a normal.
NBE05978,"I can't believe that there are ""gay and straight"" traffic lights in Austria. It is very good that the Austrian society accepts gay. However, that traffic lights is abnormal. WHY AUSTRIAN PEOPLE!"
NBE06365,"The discrimination against the same sex couples are severe in the world, also in Japan. Homosexuals should be treated equally by other people even if they do not understand them. It might be difficult problem for all people. However, the society that people do not accept homosexuals cannot make an equal society. It needs corporations of people to make its society, therefore governments should consider a counter plan to help people who are not able to be accepted their homosexuality by societies. Recently, some people who declare homoeroticism are increasing, so I hope it becomes an equal world."
NBE05979,I think so too that such culture is not accept in Japan. And also we should consider this issue. But I think we don't need to make such traffic lights.
NBE06610,"I think this event is good because we mustn't discriminate same-sex couples. In the past, we think they were strange. But now, number of them seem to increase. Our common sense always change and will change. Then we must change thinking and correspond to the situation."
NBE06364,"I agree. I also think most of the Japanese people do not accept those movements. However, if it holds in Tokyo, more people may be interested in the same-sex couples. The traffic lights are seen by lots of people including foreigners, so it will be able to get an attention."
NBE06608,I agree with you. It is epoch-making idea to insist on same-sex couples is normal. I think this idea is noticed by a people well.
NBE06546,"I have never heard this news about the idea of unique traffic lights in Austria. I think it effective to understand LGBT. In Austria, some people oppose this idea because of contravention of traffic regulations and financial reason. However, a large number of ""likes"" on the Facebook may reflect public opinion. Nowadays, I often hear the word ""LGBT"" which refers to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender. But, compared with foreign countries, Japanese society doesn't seems to be tolerant toward those people yet. So, I think, Japan also should do some efforts like that."
NBE05541,"I was very surprised to read this news. When I read it, I wondered if there is a need to set up lights at pedestrian crossing that show pairs of figures instead of the usual stick man. To be sure, a series of event of it is good, but, it cost much money. According to this news, it cost $7NA, 000. I think it is a waste of money. The money can be used for a more important thing, I think."
NBE05538,"At first, I couldn't understand, too. In Japan, gay couples are not recognized except from a part of the area. In a TV show, a topic of gay is often picked up, but there is still a social prejudice. We have to remove it."
NBE05896,I think that traffic lights should not be used as a poster because strange traffic lights can induce accidents. I also think this traffic lights do not promote equality. Everyone will look the lights curiously and not think about it seriously. I think the cost of this campaign should be used to other things.
NBE06905,"Since I live in Japan, I've never seen the various traffic lights. So when I heard the topic, it takes time to understand it. Recently, the mass media has become to take up the topic about the right of a homosexual. I agree that gay should get the opportunity to live more comfortable. Thinking of the law system in Japan, however, there are many points of improvement to live equally. Following this topic in Australia, we need to think of the right of homosexual."
NBE05739,"I agree with you. The sexual problems are still difficult to solve. However, we should try to understand them."
NBE07442,I think this idea would be able to diminish the prejudice that guy couples are abnormal. this plan should be done all over the world.
NBE05738,"Before I read the article, I'd never heard this movement. However, this is very interesting and meaningful. That's because this can make people accept homosexuality more. I want to do same action in my country. In Japan, same-sex marriage isn't admitted. Besides, some people think they can't accept them. So, I think, there are people who suffer from their homosexuality. We should understand them more and shouldn't exclude them from society."
NBE06484,I agree with you. I think installation of 'gay and straight' traffic lights in Japan will lead to promote tolerance and legalize same-sex marriage.
NBE07005,I agree to your comment that this kind of tolerance may be necessary for public event but I think that it is necessary not only in Europe but also in all world.
NBE07251,"I agree with you, because it is good way in order to think about homosexuality. So I want to try this tackling in Japan too."
NBE05207,"I was surprised that there really exist gay and straight traffic lights. I don't have the idea of the same sex couples, so I doubt the necessary of this type of traffic lights. I don't criticize transgender , but I think that those traffic lights don't need."
NBE05206,"I agree with you. I also think that it is good that the Australian society accepts gay, but this type of traffic lights have no utilities for the usual public."
NBE06220,"This movement is interesting. It will help people become conscious of sexual minority, and make some of them tolerant of it. I think what is needed for same-sex couples to be accepted is general understanding and tolerance towards them, and these strange traffic lights will make a difference."
NBE05775,I think so. This campaign is likely to miss the primary function of signals. Keeping safety is more important than prevailing a new thought.
NBE06219,"Certainly, like you, there are many people who don't have any bias against same-sex couples, but some people do. I think this movement is needed."
NBE06761,"I agree with your comment. Homosexual people especially in Japan suffer from discrimination, so I think we should promote such movement as possible."
NBE07407,"This traffic lights in Vienna are so interesting. And more interesting things is many pedestrians like this concept. We should promote this idea that same-sex couples are normal. But, I think some people oppose it in Japan. We Japanese should introduce this attempt, too."
NBE07374,I agree with you. This traffic signs is good for helping people be aware of sexual minority. But I think the icon adopted traffic signs should be more simple as well as the conventional one.
NBE05920,I think that this trend is good . Japan should promote this idea.
NBE05919,I agree with your opinion.
NBE07406,"I was very surprised, too. We should imitate this idea and think more carefully about homosexuality. There is no discrimination"
NBE06423,"This action is very fabulous. I didn't know gay and straight traffic lights. I think that this plan and this thought are very good and should be evaluated. However, people don't accepted same-sex couples in Japan, especially. The task which we must do is to accept same-sex couples."
NBE06290,I think this idea is very important for taking sexism away all over the world. Accepting gay officially is essential when we try to live in comfortable in the city.
NBE06289,"I agree with the idea that Japan introduce that kind of device. In my opinion, Japan still ignorant of sexism."
NBE05630,I agree with you!Not only Austria people but also Japanese should accept these traffic lights someday.
NBE06185,"It is very difficult to execute this trial in Japan. Since Japanese society don't accept gay couple. this idea is not bad. However, Japanese should add other function to traffic lights. It is to display number of seconds before turning the traffic light on the screen of traffic lights."
NBE06183,I agree with you. This idea will change prejudice of Austrian and people in the world. I pray that all people in the world will be able to live freely and happily.
NBE06937,"I think Japan has to introduce this lights. This is because Japan has the bias to gender. If we introduce this, Japan can solve the gender problem."
NBE06936,"I think so , too. If we introduce this lights, we can live in comfortable in the city."
NBE05948,I'm surprised to read this article . in many countries gays and lesbians are gradually accepted. However Japanese people still think these people negatively. I think we should be more liberal.
NBE05946,I agree with your idea. This idea will make Japan better.
NBE07035,"when I read this title, I wonder if 'gay and straight ' traffic lights are needed. However, when I read this article, I think that in order that people gain the understanding for gay, the trial like this is necessary. Particularly in Japan it is hard for gay to be accepted by others, so I think that in Japan the trial like this should be done."
NBE07223,I think such movements in Europe are very strange and rational.
NBE06452,This signal is very unique and is the thing getting a lot of looks of the person watching it. Therefore it will be a chance to have people interest about homosexuality to increase these signals. And it will be the opportunity that homosexual is permitted worldwide.
NBE05513,I agree with you. I think also that we should spread such a movement in Japan. And I want to eliminate the prejudice against homosexuals.
NBE05653,"I think about gay in generosity, and Austrians are think about gay in generosity too. I think that the idea of the signal of gay is grate!! I think that the racial discrimination is not good, because the people have various thoughts. We should treat gay like us."
NBE06548,I think so. Those people such as gay or lesbian in Japan should be accepted more.
NBE05895,I agree with you. I think this traffic light can induce accidents. They should promote the campaign in the other way.
NBE05709,"I think this decreasing bias to same couple plan is interesting and very important concept. In Japan, this concept is not perfectly received. But it is going to usual in Japan too I think. Because, I heard the news that same couple is admitted in Shibuya, Tokyo"
NBE06791,"When I read this article, It is interesting for me that gay or lesbian is accepted in many countries. So , I think that in Japan , they should be accepted though it is true that Japanese have the prejudice against them."
NBE05708,I remembered this news too when I read this article.
NBE06790,"I think so , too. It is important for us to have flexible thinking because it is bad that we are stereotyped ."
NBE06149,"I think that this campaign is very good for both gay and straight. This is why we must pay attention to traffic signals traffic signals, so they are to attract the attention of all road users, both drivers and pedestrians. Probably people in public have few opportunities to know about gay. So, the interest in gay of people in public will be increased with an increase in this campaign. I think that it is important to deepen the understanding to gay before criticizing it."
NBE06333,"I agree with the idea that we state the equality in traffic lights. It is true that new lights lead to waste of money. However, it's ""waste"" has great importance, I think. People have started to take actions against discriminations such as gay. But people haven't changed their way of thinking completely. They feel some sense of incongruity in their mind. Therefore, I think it is important to take in true equality in daily life. New traffic lights are good start!"
NBE05809,"I was surprised at this news. But I think this is a good idea to have various kinds of signal lights, because we all should be treated equal. And by such a signals I think those people could feel better!"
NBE05808,I think this idea is so unique too. And this could get many people interested in those thing. But I'm not sure if we should install these system in Japan. Cause we don't like to change something.
NBE06148,"I agree with your opinion. When I read this title, I was not able to imagine the contents of the sentence, too. If it was able to reduce accidents and also, people would be able to understand about gay more and more, it is very good idea of killing two birds with one stone, I think."
NBE06335,"I think so, too. To produce such traffic lights our conscious are improved."
NBE06334,"I think so , too. To produce such traffic lights, our conscious are improved."
NBE06037,"I think this idea is so clever. In this world, there are various people and these days many people know about them who are same-sex couples and they think it is normal. But in Japan, not all people feel so. To know about them is the most important, I think."
NBE05844,I think that gay traffic lights are great. It's generally said that Japanese people understand little. Japanese government should install gay traffic lights for Japanese people to understand gay.
NBE06669,"Although it's important to consider gender, for example bisexual or homosexual people and so on, it's not necessarily that pedestrian traffic lights depict various couples. I think there is another way."
NBE06036,"I think so too. various people have various idea. When many people accept this idea, not only traffic problems but also social problems will go in a positive way."
NBE06670,"I think so. I think we, Japanese people should consider various people, including homosexual people. We must need to discuss them."
NBE07164,"Traffic lights of the same sex is an interesting idea. We should be the equal treatment to the all of the people. I do not know the plan of the equal treatment. If it plays in Japan, I do not see at the pubLic, so I think Japan carries on it openly."
NBE07163,I think so. This idea makes Japan more freely.
NBE06969,I agree with you. Japan should promote many things about homosexuals. We cannot discuss various things without them in this society.
NBE05170,"From this article, I knew that there were varieties of lights in the world for the first time. I'm familiar with Japanese one, which has only red, yellow and green, so I expect that I won't be able to cross the road in Vienna easily. Also, I noticed that world people thought about the equality of same-sex couples seriously. The way of promoting it is indirect, I feel. However, the way is also close to citizens and clear for them. In Japan, few people think about sexual problems seriously, so these lights may be installed at Japan, more Japanese people will have interest in it, I think."
NBE05171,"I also think it is a good way of promoting the perspective on sexual problems. I hadn't thought about the problems seriously, too, so I felt I must have think more about them. The thought that same-sex couples are normal may be achieved father in the future, but it is certainly going ahead to good direction, I think."
NBE05172,"I couldn't also believe there were these lights normally. The idea is difficult for me, too, but I think that it is good way of promoting the perspective on sexual problems. Taking account of both your opinion and my opinion, it is certain that homosexuals' opinions is most important."
NBE05292,"I think so too. Japanese people seem to be negative to homosexuality, so it cost us many time to get accustomed with the traffic signals."
NBE05291,"I agree with your opinion. These days the world accepts homosexuality, so Japan should try to be positive such an action."
NBE05309,"That is very good idea to set up these traffic rights. I think these lights enable sexual minority people to live comfortable lives. Now, People who is gay or lesbian are completely accepted in Japan. This traffic lights should be adopted in Japan."
NBE05380,I also think that it is desirable for these traffic light to be adopted in Japan. Maybe the idea that same-sex couple is normal will take root more in Japan.
NBE05365,"It was not until I read the article that I knew the positive movement to promote tolerance for gay. I think that the campaign is great because traffic lights are seen by a lot of people, so the signals will be a chance to make many people feel gay of a minority to be familiar."
NBE05433,"I think this is good idea to change some peoples' think that same-sex couple is strange, but this traffic lights is for gay couples. There should be more traffic lights for lesbian couples."
NBE05432,"I agree with your opinion that Japanese government should install signals like Vienna! But, if such signals appeared quickly in the street, we may feel out of place."
NBE05337,I agree with you. Japan should promote so many things about homosexuals. So young people must discuss this topic.
NBE05449,There are many gays every country. I tend to agree with Australian new traffic system. They appear in public place so that gays are admitted in true meanings. Japan also should appreciate same-sex marriage.
NBE05042,I have a friend who are a sexually minority. She is really good girl and kind for every one but she cannot marry legally in Japan. I want Japanese government to make a low that she can marry with who she really loves. So I agree with this champaign because every one gets a chance to understand them.
NBE05471,"I saw such the traffic lights represented a gay couple for the first time. I was surprised and think very interesting topic. I think the form of loving is free and recently, other countries have a positive thinking for same-sex couples couples. The traffic lights are representing that world people think about same-sex couple deeply. In Japan, a lot of people don't tend to think about that, and they are few chance that they can know same-sex couple. I also don't know about same-sex couple. I would like to study about this topic from this time."
NBE05472,"I tend to agree your opinion. Japanese people don't have a chance thinking about same-sex couple and those people I think, so the government should try to do an action to promote this topic."
NBE05473,"Your straight opinion is valuable . I also wonder this traffic light really promote equality. If this lights come to Japan, Japanese people confuse and may increase the accidents. They have become usual lights."
NBE05147,"I agree with your opinion. I also think about the form of loving is free. But in Japan, we do not often see those people than other countries. I think Japanese society do not have the society which those people can live easily. The Japanese society should make the society which such people are easy to live more. The activity to make traffic lights is very meaningful to make such a society. So Japan should try to do such activity like other countries"
NBE05041,I agree with you. The lack of Japan is publication of gays. I also hope that they can marriage legally in Japan.
NBE05043,"I think so too. For Japanese people, it is difficult to get a chance to know or understand them because many people don't make relationship with them. So, to get a chance to know spontaneously is important."
NBE07095,"This was interesting and important topic to think about. Nowadays, people are more and more concerned about their freedom and rights. These rights includes same sex marriage. This topic is still very sensitive but we have to face it."
NBE07305,"I don't think that Japan can solve the gender problem by introducing the traffic lights. Although they may help us be aware of the problem, it can't be solved by only doing so. With this as a start, we have to know about gay people. Then I think we should understand that there are various values and accept them."
NBE05076,The news recognized me to be a lot of types thinking. I can't understand but I think I should receive these people and I should be effort to understand these people.
NBE06699,"I think it very good idea, but I feel something strange. If we respect all kind of gender and people, heterosexual people has to respected. Changing all traffic lights is too much."
NBE07375,"I disagree with you about how to capture the way of installing new traffic sign. I think we should be more tolerant of homosexuality, but I think it is odd to adopt gay illustration in traffic signs."
NBE07469,"I agree with your idea. In Japan, same-sex marriage isn't recognized yet, but the gay traffic lights are the first step for tolerance for the same-sex marriage."
NBE05867,"This is very interesting idea showing Vienna's tolerance for gender. I also agreed it. Every time pedestrians walk through the crosswalks and see these new traffic lights, they will remember homosexual lovers. Then, whole society will become considerate. In addition, given that many ""likes"" on Facebook, people are satisfied to have taken part in this project by paying taxes. So these should be introduced into other areas."
NBE05868,"You have a really good friend! The other day, same-sex couples were allowed to marry legally in America. This is wonderful news for her! Although Japan is conservative to this matters, I hope that she will be able to marry in Japan."
NBE05539,"I agree to your opinion. In fact, the impact of advertising may be big. However, this should not be done with much money. There must be better way."
NBE05540,"I haven't thought about homosexual couples well. These days, these couples have not been discriminated. However, understanding of them is not still enough. We have to know them more."
NBE06104,I agree with you. Japanese people should think about gay culture. Japanese people have prejudice idea about gay culture. Marriage of LGBT officially allowed in all states in the US. I believe that it should be allowed in Japan.
NBE05894,"I agree with you. As a same-sex marriage was permitted in US , the kind of tolerance should be permitted all over the world."
NBE07094,"I was very interested when I first read this news. Recently, allowance of homosexual has became the major topic in the world including America and Japan. Shibuya recently allowed homosexual marriage in the prefecture law. In addition, I found the way they connected road lights and homosexual problem very innovative. I think it is the first attempt to do it. I hope this will success to increase the awareness about both homosexual and road safety."
NBE06222,"You are right. Knowledge makes understanding, and understanding makes tolerance."
NBE06221,"Yes, we should think about the problem more."
NBE05654,Yes! This event is very interested news! Japan should suggest many idea for gay or LGBT or ect. . . However people recognized a gay in Shibuya! This event support by Shinzo Abe's wife! The day when a gay is recognized in Japan is not far.
NBE06451,"It is a good idea! However, the interest in LGBT of people may fade when signals of LGBT increase and come common. I think that an idea with any other topicality of the signal is necessary."
NBE06450,"As for the homosexuality, there are still a lot of people that the ""abnormality"" ""perversion"" word ""to be metamorphic"" appears on the head. In addition, there is really the person pouring such words for a homosexual. However, in the first place a human being is not a simple animal that an object to turn love to is limited to the opposite sex. I think that neighboring people should understand such a thing."
NBE06851,"I see. It is question for us why Australian people can accept these strange traffic light. In Japan, it is unbelief to use these light and accept our society but we have to change these strange sense of value to make our society various."
NBE05235,I agree with your idea. This age is not same as that of old days. We should follow any situation as time passed. There are a lot of people who don't have the same idea as we about sex. We ought to receive them for their comfortable life.
NBE05308,I agree with your opinion. We can not discuss social problem without gay problem. Japanese people do not know a lot about gay people and have a prejudice. So these traffic lights might be really good opportunity to think about gay people.
NBE06485,"I agree with you. This movement is efficient because almost everyone looks signals every day. But, I worry that some look the lights curiously and just for fun. I hope same-sex marriage is allowed in Japan."
NBE06643,I agree with you. Homosexuals are now discriminated in Japanese society.
NBE06644,"I don't know that there are some kinds of traffic rights that give people messages to think about homosexual until finish reading this article. I think these kinds of traffic rights are interesting and enable people to think about diversity of sexual reference. People often despise homosexual people. That may be an infringement of human rights. Therefore, people should accept homosexuality"
NBE06547,"I think it could be the good opportunity that we accept LGBT, too."
NBE06609,I think people around the world pays attention to this topic because US Supreme Court judged same-sex marriage is reasonable right in the Constitution. I think the world is in the stream judging homosexual love. But some people opposes it because of religion and etc. Maybe it will be a long time to judge homosexual around the world. Love doesn't relate to sex.
NBE06549,"Your opinion made me think about this news more deeply! Indeed they may induce accidents. But I don't agree with your thought that they are not related to promotion of equality. By the mass media or SNS, these unique traffic rights will become a topic of conversation. This is great step."
NBE07006,I agree you. Japanese people don't have opportunities that they think about gay and gay is not accepted. Therefore we should introduce this gay and traffic light and attract attention.
NBE05774,"I agree with your opinion about last sentences especially. Today, the public opinion in Japan is still strict for homosexual. Although I don't know this ideology is right, this ideology is received acceptance for the world more."
NBE06581,"I agree with your opinion. It is important to discuss the problem, thereby it will resolve."
NBE06820,"I think so too because gay culture do not spread in Japan. However, recently I often see such people in TV etc. So the example like article should be accepted in Japan."
NBE06520,"I agree with you and have the same opponent. Such idea is good in reducing the sexual discrimination and attracting passenger's attention. Last month, I heard a piece of news about same-sex marriage is admitted in America. I want this movement to spread around the world."
NBE07284,"I do not know that kind of movements are taken place. In Japan, there are few people who care about that kind of problem. We have to know that kind of people are worry about their treatment. We have to acknowledge and recognize these problems."
NBE05947,I think so too. we Japanese are a little too indifferent this issue.
NBE05687,"We usually don't think the right of gays, so it is revolutionary idea that they use traffic lights that all people see every day for campaign. Actually, in these days, it seems that the campaign of the right of homosexuality is stimulating. For instance, same-sex marriage has just accepted in all states in America."
NBE05686,"I agree with your opinion. ""straight"" people sometimes have bias against ""gay"" people. However, through like these campaign, it can make people pay attention to gay and deepen people's understanding to gay, and people won't criticize them unreasonably."
NBE07189,"This idea has 2 sides, pro and con. It can be seen as a discrimination since we separate lights from the normal ones. It also shows that we have understanding about particular sexual propensity. It may work well in Austria, but if it were installed into Japan, I don't think so, being that some of us still think that the LGBTs are not in our company"
NBE07188,"I agree with your opinion. However, it is true that there are people of LGBT in the world since it is proved biologically that 1NA% of human are to be born as LGBT, so we will have to consider about this issue in some time."
NBE07340,"I agree that this kind of idea is not familiar for Japanese people, but I think most people will not be opposed to this if this happens in Japan. It is because I remembered the news that people make their profile pictures rainbow on facebook after gay marriage becomes completely legal in the United States. I see a lot of my Japanese friends did it."
NBE06016,I've got different point of view on this your opinion. I don't think gay culture is not received perfectly in Japan. I have a friend who are gay. but he accept all people who are around him. we have to make opportunity which is gay such as him become famous. Even if it is change traffic right
NBE05918,"I agree with your idea. In the U. S , the same sex couples were allowed to marry with. This trend is important and we should speed this trend all over the world."
NBE05897,"Thank you for your comment. I didn't think that the traffic lights will promoted by SNS. I rethink that it is useful to promote equality, but I also think that the traffic lights may be made a fool of on SNS."
NBE06393,I think that Japan should take this plan because sexual problems are happening now. I allows us to recognize particular sexual propensity.
NBE06067,"I think this event was wonderful. Japan has positively progressed the problem of LGBT, but it is still lag. We should get the understanding of LGBT and prepare new system for them after deep deliberation."
NBE06184,"I think so. Certainly, this idea is very unique and good idea. Though the idea is effective Austria because Austria is tolerance for guy couple. It is not effective much in Japan which is not tolerance for guy couple."
NBE06789,"I think so , too. I think it is an important thing in the coming world to recognize homosexuality all over the world."
NBE07252,"I think so too. Before, I didn't know about the gay culture. But recently, I found there are many people who is gay on TV. So we may should import this traffic signals."
NBE06066,"I agree with you. Japan is far behind other developed country such as US in the understanding of the LGBT. Recently, states are considering legalizing same-sex marriage. Meanwhile, The Shibuya ward has become the first place in Japan to recognize same-sex partnerships. Although, we also acknowledge the developing."
NBE06938,"I think so , too. Japan also tackle homosexuals problems."
NBE06035,"I think so , too. And this problem is more difficult than we think. It is most important thing to know more about this problem. So what now Japanese society will become acceptance or not, we must be careful."
NBE07120,"I think so too. In Japan, homosexual is not accepted. We should make comfortable society for homosexual."
NBE06394,WE should THINK DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NORMAL AND OTHER COUPLES . BUT I THINK THAT WE SHOULD NOT THINK THIS DEEPLY.
NBE07034,"I agree with your opinion. I think that little Japanese people have the understandings for same-sex couple because they don't have the chance. Therefore, like vienna, Japanese government should do the similar trial and gradually gain the consensus."
NBE05100,"When I read this article for the first time, I was very surprised at the picture of signal. I have not seen the signals like this picture in Japan. These days, the problem of homosexual is increasing. I think it is important for us to think about this problem."
NBE05099,"I agree your opinion. As you know, It is obvious that Japanese don't know the same-sex couples . I think we should learn the problem of homosexual more and look at the positive side of the problem. Of course, I also want to know the problem taking this as an opportunity."
NBE05363,I think so too. This movement will be make Japan an equal society if Japan accepts this system.
NBE05364,I was surprised when I read this article for the first time. But the movement is extremely nice because the rights of both normal couples and gay couples are equal.
NBE05362,I agree with you. I think also Japan should accept same-sex marriage system.
NBE05470,"I also think people around the world pas attention to this topic!! When I heard the news of the legalization of the same-sex marriage in all state of America, I remembered this topic. Many Japanese people don't think this topic deeply. I also was. I'm glad to have a chance to think about this."
NBE05500,I agree with the way of installing new traffic signs. This problem has not been aware of recently. It is time that we should be more tolerant of homosexuality. We can't laugh at people who are not straight.
NBE05448,I agree with you about installing new traffic sign. I think discrimination consciousness to same sex should be lost.
NBE05563,I think it is fair. We should to be fair to all people
NBE05075,I agree with your opinion. We should think these people.
NBE06015,I am opposed to your opinion. Because there is a possibility that the declining birthrate and aging population. Marriage with the opposite sex is I should think of law of nature. Same-sex marriage it should refrain because it may also be a problem in the religious. It might be some people that do not have to put up in people But not ginger. Also in Japan exist opinion like that.
NBE07491,"When I was in New Zealand there was a homo-sexual day and we did some activities to accept homosexual people like ATM on the street was re-painted to ""gAyTM"". For me that activity was so impressive because as you know Japan still take disadvantage on same gender marriage and many people sometimes do not accept homo-sexual people. but I thought, if we do some activities for them, it already recognized them as different. if we really think we should recognize them as normal, I mean same as others, we should not do anything special. We should only make a law for their comfortable lives. I do not disagree to spend tax on doing such kind of activities, but more people do some special things for homosexual people more they might feel uncomfortable."
NBE07503,"I think it is a great challenge to capture many people's attention about gay. This is one of the biggest topic and trend all over the world nowadays. As you know, same sex marriage is now legal in all states in the US. Before that, only a few states allowed same sex marriage so lots of people came to the states to marry. Many people were waited this so there were lots of celebrations everywhere. And it was a big trend that Facebook users changed their profile picture to one with a rainbow filter to celebrate the new law in the US. According to these trends, many people are very positive about gay. It is very delightful change that we are allowed to have the equally right to love someone even if he or she is the same sex and allowed to open it. This change is spreading in many countries like the US and European countries, but I think gay people still hard to live to open that they are gay. Recently, it is getting better environmental for gay people than before. For example, we see more famous people on TV who are gay and sexless clothes are trend now. However, there are still discriminations and I think there are more discriminations in Japan than the US. One of may gay friends told me that he can tell that he is a gay to his American friends but he doesn't want to tell Japanese friends because he is afraid of a prejudice. I think nothing wrong to love someone and they should open it like straight people do. I hope Japan will be the comfortable place for gay people too."
NBE06971,"I learned two things about presentation today. First, I learned the importance of doing eye-contact. I realized eye-contact was necessary to see whether listeners understand the presentation or not. So speakers can give additional explanations when listeners don't understand the presentation. I think we have good communication by doing eye-contact. Secondly, I felt the influence of figures and pictures. Slides help us to understand the presentation deeply. No matter how good the presentation is, it is difficult for listeners to grasp the outline of the presentation."
NBE06972,"I learned two things about presentation today. First, I learned the importance of doing eye-contact.

I think we have good communication by doing eye-contact. Secondly, I felt the influence of figures and pictures. Slides help us to understand the presentation deeply. No matter how good the presentation is, it is difficult for listeners to grasp the outline of the presentation without detailed slides."
NBE07471,"In this class, I gave a presentation in English for the first time, and I became aware that it was very difficult to give a presentation. I learned two important things about presentation. First, I think I should have learned what I was going to say by heart in order to speak more smoothly and to speak with confidence, because when I gave a presentation, I was so nervous that I sometimes forgot what I was going to say. Second, it is very important for us to make eye-contact. By doing it, we can realize whether listener can understand our presentation, or not."
NBE07307,"Through this presentation, I learned the importance of consideration toward listeners. I thought if listeners can't understand the content, the presentation is meaningless. When we set a theme, make slides, and speak, we should not forget to take that into account. A presenter has to give a presentation so that all listeners can comprehend the content perfectly. To do so, a presenter has to make slides which are easy to see and speak clearly using only simple words and making eye contact."
NBE07377,"Before the presentation, I was very nervous and afraid of failing. However, I was encouraged by other presenters' good evaluation for me and I came to think I would like to improve my skills by next presentation."
NBE05237,"I was nervous before the presentation, but it was interesting to tell my friends about my article and had them evaluated. The more presentation I made, the more confidence I got. I want to be careful about not only eye-contact and contents but also my voice in the next presentation."
NBE05404,"From this presentation, I learned some important things such as no reading, speaking smoothly and communicate with listeners. Before the presentation, everyone would feel nervous, but it is good to communicate with listeners while speaking. For example, pointing at slides, asking them questions and check whether listeners understanding or not. My presentation have good points and bad points, so I would like to upgrade my presentation skills."
NBE05173,"This time, I could recognize some points I should improve in presentation. At first, communication with the listeners is most important, I felt. To achieve it, we should make some actions such as making eye contact, loud voice, gesture, and keeping smiling. When a presenter makes communication with the listeners well, they will be attracted to the presentation. I think it is one of the important bases of presentation to pay attention. I would like to make more corrective presentation with using these ways attract my own listeners next my presentation."
NBE07008,"I noticed important points by this presentation. First, we should make noticeable slides as many people pay attention to when we make presentation slides. Second, we should speak more slowly when we do presentation because speech speed of everyday conversation is too first when it comes to presentation. Third, we should make eye contact more often in order to discern listener understanding our presentation when we do presentation ."
NBE06763,"I was nervous before the presentation, but that presentation is a good experience for me. From this presentation, I learned two important things of presentation. Firstly, making eye contact is one of the most effective way to attract attention of listeners. That makes presenter find whether listeners can understand content of presentation. Secondly, we need to speak more clearly. When I listen, I couldn't understand what presenter said because presenter's voice is not so clearly. I want to improve my presentation skill by next presentation."
NBE07190,"I guess I wasn't really as nervous as others were since I'm kind of used to doing such presentation in foreign language. Although it was just a 5 min presentation, it accumulated and became one of my precious experiences."
NBE06853,"My presentation was not bad I think because I got AAA by listeners but if I can I want to remember the text in next time. I learned important of eye-contact. It is good impression by presenter and listeners eye-contact so next time, I want to do that. Secondly, nice Slides help us to understand content easily. Too much words is on the contrary difficulty to understand so we have to insert picture moderately. Lastly we have to choose easy English. Difficult English, for example we have to use dictionary to understand is not help our presentation."
NBE06106,"I learned a lot of things about presentation. First of all, eye-contact is very important. When I take the eye-contact, I can check that partner understand my presentation. If when partner cannot understand my presentation, I should use body language or pointing my slide. In addition, slide is very important for understanding presentation. There are a lot of pictures on the slide, partner can understand my presentation easily. Finally, speaking loudly is very important because if partner cannot hear my voice, partner cannot understand my presentation. All in all, eye-contact, good slide and big voice is very important."
NBE05591,"I learned a lot about what people should endeavor to present. Firstly, too long and too complex slides are very difficult for listeners to understand. I have made my slides the contents of which was complex. I thought that my slides was easy for everyone to understand. However, one of the students said, ""Your slides are long and the contents are very difficult"". I was shocked. So, I will have to try to make so easy slides next time. Secondly, speaking clearly and loudly is important. However difficult slides are, as long as speakers speak clearly and loudly, listeners may understand a little. By the way, all three presenters said ""I will start my presentation"". On the other hand, I said ""I am going to start my presentation. "" I do not know which expression is right. I use ""be going to"" because we use ""be going to"" when we have already decided to do something. In this situation, all three presenters did not expect presenting. That was interesting."
NBE06883,"Through this presentation, I learned the importance of eye-contact. When we talk with our friends, we usually do eye-contact. We could understand their feelings by looking at their eyes, so eye-contact is very important for everyone to communicate with person. However, I was not able to do eye-contact with listeners very well. If I have done eye-contact in my presentation, I could enjoy conversational give-and-take. I was very interested in other presentations and I could broaden my knowledge through this class."
NBE05632,"Eye-contact is good thing to make listener hear and understand speaking things, so I will make an effort to do that more often next time. In addition, to translate difficult words into easy words is useful way to communicate smooth, so I will prepare easy words in order to paraphrase difficult words into them when a listener seems not to understand the meaning. In spite of these reflections, I would like to utilize good points of my presentation like clear slides and voice next time."
NBE07408,"I think English presentation was so difficult, but I must speak more smoothly and look the listener's eyes. In this presentation, I only read my manuscript. This is bad as presentation. Eye contact is the important way of tell what I want to say to others. I don't understand this point. I want to do this at the next. Also presentation's contents and slides are important, too. The good Slides are simply and easily and colorful. We understand almost to read the presentation. But, contents are not simply. The presentation of much substance is good. I learn my presentation is not perfect in this class."
NBE06584,"Through this presentation, I found it was hard to convey my thought. Moreover I had difficulty answering presenter's questions. Since I could not make presentation in easy English, I think that it is necessary to study English harder. It was interesting to share a problem with a partner through presentation."
NBE07122,"I learned importance of speaking in this presentation. If I speak too fast, listeners cannot understand my presentation. If I speak too slowly, listeners are get tired. If I speak too small voice, listener cannot hear my presentation. If I speak too big voice, listener cannot notice important points in my presentation."
NBE06247,"I enjoyed to hear presentations because each theme was interesting and important for us. Through their presentations, I learned following two important points. First of all, when we make a presentation, eye-contact is one of the most important measures to persuade listeners. So, I thought we should not rely too much on memo. In addition, presenter may get nervous, they should try to speak with confidence. If they look without confidence, their speech may not get persuasive. I would like to put these important points in to practice next time"
NBE05898,"I think I was too tense to speak with smile, so the impression of my presentation got gloomy. I learned the importance of impression. I will speak in a cheerful voice and with smile in next time."
NBE05101,"I learned many points to improve my presentation from this class. In many points, slides is most important point, I think. Clear slides help us to understand the presentation smoothly and deeply. If the slides is bad, the presentation is not perfect, no matter how great the presentation is. I want to take in the point I know in this presentation into next one."
NBE06611,"I learned two points about presentation. First point is importance of eye-contact. This action tells me enthusiasm from a presenter and make it easy to hear contents. Second point is confirming whether to understand contents, or not. This action carries interactive communication. I think my presentation is not good because I couldn't speak clear and brief contents. So I want to speak clear, get them in sharp and do two points next time."
NBE06822,"I learn the importance of enthusiasm for telling my presentation. For example, watching listener's eye, and intonation of speaking. If there are things to want to tell, big voice is the most effective. Each people' speaking skill is different, I try to forget the enthusiasm of telling."
NBE06487,"I learned that it was important to pay attention to whether listeners understand the contents of the presentation. This time, I tried to communicate with listeners by making eye contact. Next time, I will give additional explanations to listeners who don't understand main point of the presentation."
NBE06728,"I think I should use easy words that are understood correctly by everyone in presentation. If I use difficult words and long sentence, listeners can't understand my presentation smoothly. Moreover, it's need pictures that are fit with contents and eye contact to be plain enough. It's most important that I have a feeling to say to tell."
NBE05542,"This time, I found presentation difficult. And also, I found it not easy to tell my partner what I wanted to transmit in English. In this presentation, the most important I learned is eye contact. By eye contact. I can check whether my partner understand what I tell. However, I can't look at his or her eyes this time. So, if I do a presentation next time, I'll care for that point."
NBE07036,"Thanks to others' presentation, I learned what I should have care at presentation. There is two things. One thing is that I should make slides easy to understand, using not only pictures but maps and chart and graphics. The other thing is that I should make what I want to say brief. I used too many words to explain my presentation. I should have summarize that."
NBE05450,"I was nervous before the presentation, but by the class finished, l was interested in the presentation. Most people say eye contact is important. I learned the importance of eye-contact on the presentation, too. If l would see presenter's eyes, even if I notice the vocabulary I forgot, I can appreciate his words vaguely. In the next presentation I want to be care about eye-contact."
NBE05741,"I understood difficulty of the presentation. We are called for enough preparation and speaking skills. And, this presentation needed cooperation of our teammate. I was helped much by them. So, in the next time, I'd like to help them in return."
NBE06906,"Giving a presentation, I learned that even if I believed that the vocabulary, content and speed of my presentation are good, the partner may not understand it definitely. It is so important that I think whether the partner listens to my speech easily and to speak while confirming an understanding degree of the partner by various ways such as eye contact and questions."
NBE05710,"I felt difficult for me to conduct presentation. Because I need to pay attention to speak clearly, appropriate speaking speed, use easier word, keep a decent form a page, need eye contact etc, , , . If I will conduct presentation next time, I should especially care about good eye contact and clear voice."
NBE07443,"I learned we should speak slowly in speeching. And, we should avoid using same word many times."
NBE06939,"Before the presentation, I was very nervous and afraid of failing, but I noticed very important points of presentations. First, we need to prepare for presentations seriously. If we don't prepare, we can't do good presentations. Second, we try to communicate with listeners. When we do it, our presentations become great."
NBE07165,"I learned the importance of remembering contents from this presentation. When I tell people about contents, I have to remember the all contents perfectly. So next time, I will remember the all contents and words perfectly in doing presentation."
NBE05515,"Making the presentation was difficult for me. Communication with the other party is important in the presentation. For example, you can speak with smile and take the eye contact. In addition, since it is boring to talk monotonously, it was important that I get to listen willingly to the other party by attaching the strength and gestures. In the presentation I think that it is more important representation of the way than the perfection of the content."
NBE05655,"There was my presentation at the point that the good point had bad a lot. I recognized that presentation was difficult. Good point is script, voice, eye-contact, slide is clear and intelligent. However bad point is that I prepared too late and use difficult word. I cannot These want to continue it in future."
NBE05949,"I learned a lot of things from this presentation. For example, taking the eye contact is most important. If I take the eye contact I can get my points across more than I just read the script without eye contact. Next time I want to give better presentation"
NBE06792,"The first is that eye-contact and quality of the voice and easiness in seeing the slides really help the understanding about the presentation. The second is that it is difficult to have a partner understand one's thing that I want to convey. If there is an opportunity of the presentation next, I make use of having learned this time and I think that I want to do the presentation that is better than this presentation."
NBE06186,"English presentation is too difficult for me. There are many times not to be able to rephrase English from Japanese which I want to say. So, I'm not satisfied in my presentation and I found a lot of things to learn from other presentation. I felt good presentation has good slide, easy contents, clear speaking and many eye contacts. I want to take care of clear speaking and many eye contacts especially."
NBE05688,"I learned it was difficult to make listeners understood what I wanted to tell only by oral communication. Because they don't have information of my topic, so presenter have to explain carefully and not to forget to check if listeners can understand correctly. In my presentation, I paid attention to the way of speaking. For example, I changed my vice tone to emphasize main point or important words. So I think I didn't read the draft and can communicate with listeners. However, I used several technical words, so I had to use much simpler words."
NBE06038,"For me the presentation in English is very rare, so it was good experience, I think. I heard presentation of my classmates and I have to learn from those. When explaining news topic, the ways are so various. I want to know and acquire how to explain best."
NBE06550,"I learned something in the last class. First, using many data or graphs in presentations is very important because it helps listeners understand my own presentation. Second, it is not easy to make eye contact with listeners especially English speech. I was absorbed in speaking English and I tended to see the draft of the speech. Moreover, telling the main point of the presentation in easy English was not as easy as I had expected."
NBE07254,"I learned two things in this class. First, I found to make eye-contact is important to make a listener to listen and concentrate on my presentation. Second, I found to use simple word is important for a listener to understand about my presentation."
NBE05845,"I believe that every good presenter has passion to make others understand. Certainly, speaking English fluently and using clear slides is good. However, the most important thing to make good presentation is passion to make others understand. In addition, every good presentation has useful data. the data contribute to understanding topic. Also, I should have researched sufficiently. A lack of information makes bad presentation."
NBE06671,"I learned it isn't necessary to tell a lot of matters. I feel that I told many trivial things, so listeners might be confused by my presentation. Moreover my last questions are not easy. I think if they were main points, listeners could ask them."
NBE06424,"This time, I can learn the way of presentation. One of the difficult points is making listeners understand the news which I want you to know. However, I listen everyone's presentation and I think that my skill of presentation is developed this time."
NBE06150,"We may do many different devices to have a listener understand contents of the presentation. Even if it is very bothersome, to make a good presentation, we have to try to make an effort to it. For example, thinking what are the components of a good presentation are very important, I think."
NBE06522,"I was surprised at qualities of members in my team Le Monde. Before I announced my presentation, team India's may be the best of my class. However, on speaking I notice its difficulty, and also I recognized how well my teammates speak. I'll want to make use of this experience next time."
NBE05266,"I think English presentation is very difficult. Because, I couldn't speak smoothy and make eye contact with listener so much. I think I should understand and study my article to do good presentation. I couldn't this things this time."
NBE05044,Preparation is the most important thing when Japanese people do an English presentation. Last class taught me this thing. I want to prepare more detail for the next time.
NBE05366,"I felt it was important to prepare for the presentation. I should have chosen easier words for listeners to understand more clearly. If I get one more chance of presentation, I want to improve my presentation."
NBE05293,Presentation is most difficult and important thing for me because I don't get accustomed to doing it. So I think it is necessary to prepare not only what I want to say but also how to speak and represent. I need to represent myself in English fluently.
NBE07378,"I think so, too. I have to improve my English more harder than before."
NBE05149,"When I talked about my presentation, I did not prepare to speak and to understand well my presentation. Therefore, my presentation was not organized. Next time, I want to work hard and to try to prepare my presentation completely. For example, I have to make power point clearly and to practice to speak. Add to this, I want to make eye contact and body language. So my presentation will be much better!!"
NBE05127,"I think there are many important to make good presentation. First of all, nice power point is needed. It should be easy to read and understand for the audience. For example, difficult to see color such as yellow is not proper, I think. Next, paying attention toward the audience is also important. When you speak in front of other people, you should not look down. Eye contact is very important. Lastly, we have to memorize what we are going to speak. Being at a loss for words is not good. And we had better to do rehearsal for many many times."
NBE06645,"It was the first time for me to make a presentation in English. I was a little bit nervous. But my presentation for the most part went well. However, better presentation could be offered. First, I felt my voice was a bit difficult to hear for some person. Second, I don't know whether I can make eye-contact well each other. So, if I get a chance to make a presentation again, I want to make a better presentation than that of today."
NBE05870,"I had never made presentation in English, and this presentation was very fresh, interesting and exciting activity. I think my presentation is not so bad, but has many things to desire. First, I speak a little fast, so what I said was uneasy to understand for listeners. This is because it included too many contents. Good presentation only tells only important information. Second, I should have taken more eye-contact with my partner. Communication is also important factor. Presentation is made by not only speaker, but also listener. I learned that I should think in a position of audience who I talk to."
NBE05869,"I agree with your opinion, especially memorizing content. In this class, we printed out our power point, so writing down some words behind is effective way. It is not necessary to write all sentences, just only key words. And then we can avoid loss for words and learn ad-lib speaking."
NBE05777,"My reflection point in this presentation is that I couldn't say fluently. So, I'd like to improve my script which is too long to tell the story and I will cut the useless sentences. Furthermore, I was wrong about timing to change the slides, so I should have practice more."
NBE06583,"I think so, too. Through this presentation, I learned a lot. I think it is important to be considerate of my partner."
NBE05810,"I learned many things throughout this presentation. First, It is so important to use the eye-contact. I'm not used to make eye-contact because I'm shy. However if you want to make them understood. Second I need to speak clearly when speaking English. Since English is not the our first language, it is so hard to understand it when it is not clear. I think I will have the opportunity to do presentation in class someday again. In that case, I will do my best."
NBE05564,I think English presentation is very difficult. I cannot communicate what I want to tell smoothly. I have to improve my English speaking ability.
NBE07096,"I felt very sad when I first heard about this news. Prime Minister is the top of Japan so at least he should be respected by people in Japan. However, the reality is so cruel that he got jeered by important anniversary day in Okinawa. I do not agree with the idea of changing Pacific Stance and constitution. Therefore, Abe should think about how people feel, not how Americans feel or demand."
NBE06673,"It's difficult problem to solve whether for US troops to stay in Okinawa or to move away from Okinawa. Indeed it's heavy burden for Okinawa and people in Okinawa ask US troops to move away, but Okinawa is important place strategically. Especially, advance of China prove a great menace of Japan. Therefore we should discuss this problem."
NBE05239,"I think government should be more careful about the American bases in Okinawa. People in Okinawa must have suffered from the existence of American troops. When I went to Okinawa, I thought the sound of Osprey was noisy. It noises all day. Such an experience may increase the people's opposition to government. Abe should try to decrease the burden of Okinawa."
NBE05405,"I think this is a difficult problem, but I think Japanese government should more think seriously about US military facilities in Okinawa. When I went there last year, I was surprised that there were so large US bases, so I wonder the noises of bases would affect local people's life. However, some local people make their living by working at shop for solders. So this is very complicated problem, but I think government should try to reduce it."
NBE06977,"Nowadays, the discussion on Article 9 of the Constitution is incandescent in Japan. The Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Okinawa to deliver a speech in this serious time. According to the current poll, only 29% of respondents support the Abe's security bills, while 53% oppose. Okinawa is a region where the only ground battle has been carried out in Japan. Therefore, people living in Okinawa have higher interest in this speech. NHK apparently did not report that the Prime Minister Abe was openly heckled by people in there. The difference of the foreign media and Japanese media was so impressive for me. I think the Japanese media should tell true things directly."
NBE06975,"I felt very sad too when I read this news because Prime Minister is elected by the Japanese, and he tries to realize our hopes. So I think we should not jeer him. If people have some complaint, they have to appeal in another way. I agree with your idea that Abe should think about how people feel. it is difficult to solve this problem, but Abe should host more meetings about American bases in Okinawa."
NBE06974,"I agree with you because many Okinawa's people claim that the Japanese government should move American bases away from Okinawa. I think Okinawa's people receive a return by American bases. If the Japanese government continues to set American bases in Okinawa, Okinawa's people have the right to ask for return for he aid."
NBE06973,"I agree with you because many Okinawa's people claim that the Japanese government should move American bases away from Okinawa. I think Okinawa's people don't receive a return by American bases. If the Japanese government continues to set American bases in Okinawa, Okinawa's people have the right to ask for return for aid."
NBE06976,"It is good your example to understand the Okinawa's present. I have heard the news that people suffered from a serious illness because of noise. In the past, Okinawa's people sued the country for their damage from the sound of airport in 'Futenma'. It is difficult problem, but the Japanese government should solve it immediately."
NBE06884,"I think this problem is very important for Japan. It has been just 70 years since the Second World War came to an end, but we should remember this war forever. When I was a junior high school student, I went to Okinawa on a school excursion. The main purpose of this excursion was not to commune with nature but to work the importance of peace. I was very surprised to realize the truth about this war. People in Okinawa told us to keep conveying how cruel it was, so we have a duty to think about it. I think it is natural that people tend to become emotional to listen Abe's speak. It is the evidence that people think about the peace in Japan seriously. To be indifferent is irresponsible. We must keep discussing the peace."
NBE06700,"There are so many US bases in Okinawa. It's big problem, but they are really important for Japanese security. Umm. I think, biggest problem is Okinawa got and will get too much money from Japanese government as a Okinawa outlays. The amount of that money is amazingly 2.7 billion dollars(33 billion yen)in each year. Okinawa economics depend on this money. It's not good for Okinawa in long term, I mean Okinawa has to grow their economy themselves and make it strong."
NBE06109,"I think that Japanese people should think about a military base. This spring vacation, I visited Okinawa. Then I looked American base near the American village. I looked an airplane took off from the base. The airplane was very fast, so I think that it is very dangerous. Around the american base was very noisy. Therefore I think that the base gives harm to neighboring inhabitants. There are various opinions about the armed forces. However many people think that we have nothing to do with this problem. All in all, I strongly believe that all Japanese people should think about American bases in Okinawa."
NBE07473,"I am opposed Prime Minister Sinzo Abe reinterpreting the pacifist constitution. However I agree to revise the constitution. It is necessary for two points of view, I think. First, if we leave the Constitution of Japan as it is, Article 9 of the Constitution is incompatible with right to collective self-defense. We should revise the Article 9 of the Constitution, and specify the existence and the part of the Self-Defense Force. If we reinterpret the pacifist constitution, it only makes vagueness about the Self-Defense Force. Second, to revise the constitution is not equal to plunging into war, and we have to be able to defend our country against the enemy. A speech full of high-sounding ideas leads to decline the strength of a nation."
NBE07166,"I think not waging is most important thing for Japan. If war will happen by reinterpreting the pacifist constitution, I opposed the government of Prime Minister Sinzo Abe. The war hurt many people not only Japanese troops but also American troops. We have to avoid this situation as far as possible."
NBE07380,"Indeed, US air bases bring great harm to Okinawa and eliminating them may be the best way to remove that pain. However, they are key to Japanese defense capacity. In addition, it needs a enormous costs if we build a new substitute base, so removing the bases from Okinawa is very difficult, I think."
NBE06824,"I think this is a difficult problem. If I ware people in Okinawa, I were angry with Abe like people in article. However, there are no place where the American bases are replaced. We should think a new solution to solve this problem."
NBE07257,"I thought that it is difficult problem when I heard this news. And I thought that people who live in Okinawa should not do only jeering Shinzo Abe, because this action doesn't make better solution. Japanese government should think better solution about this problem and think as people who live in Okinawa . For example, to move the base to the island where people don't live in very much in Japan."
NBE07308,"As this article says, it is a very uncommon occurrence for a Japanese Prime Minister to be openly heckled by general public. I think it proves that the Okinawans' complaint reaches its peak. I think Abe should care about them more. I can't agree with recent Abe's strong stance on changing Japan's security arrangements. If he keeps it, I think the approval rate will continue to fall."
NBE05746,"I think, the reaction is reasonable for people in Okinawa. Okinawa has the terrible history. Many people still suffer from it. Besides, there are many US military base and these are threatening their way of life. So, it is natural that they got angry to Abe's insensitive attitude. Japanese government should concern Okinawan more."
NBE07063,"Okinawa has a lot of US military bases. It's very serious and difficult problem. When I went to the Futenma base of Okinawa last year, I found that the residential area is very near the base. It is natural that people in Okinawa have dissatisfaction in the base and Abe's policy. Government should do their best."
NBE05779,"Today, Okinawa has a lot of bases. It's natural that Okinawans should be angry for this. However, we shouldn't jeer in the reception marked the 70th anniversary of the battle of Okinawa. It is being a glorious. No matter how angry, they shouldn't bring their thinking in it."
NBE06701,"Your are right in point of capturing feelings of Okinawans, but Japanese government has already concerned about Okinawans in a way that giving money. It's just money but 300 billion yen for each year. I think it so large support for them."
NBE06586,"It is a serious problem that we must think about. I take a neutral position. I understand their worry about Abe's policy, while they are not allowed to jeer at Prime minister Shinzo Abe. Unless the two sides understand mutual thought, they will not make concessions."
NBE06855,"Okinawa has the history that Okinawa was occupied by the US military. It is result of Japan's ability lack of defense Okinawa in WW2. After the war, US military thought Okinawa is the best place to display the power of USA in east Asia, so they have kept place their base though Okinawa was returned to Japan in 1972. Now, Okinawa is the forefront of Japan defense so there is no choice to remove all of the base but I think Japan and USA have to relieve Okinawa's burden. If we won't do so, Okinawa people's anger will be harsher."
NBE05595,"It is very rude to jeer the Prime Minister at the formal ceremony. In Japan freedom of speech is secured in the Constitution of Japan, even the statement that ""Two newspaper in Okinawa should be dissolved. "" by one private writer Hyakuta Naoki. But the jeer at the ceremony is blameworthy. It is illogical. No one is allowed to interrupt the ceremony. By the way, we should know that all people in Okinawa disagree with the relocation of a US military base to Henoko. Rather, people in Henoko agree with that relocation. To cope with the threat of China, presence of US military is necessary."
NBE05518,"Reducing American bases significantly would be impossible, but it should reduce at least from current situation. To impose the burden on Okinawa is not good. Terrorism cannot be prevented only there is a base. National defense should be reconsidered by a national."
NBE06489,"Under the present circumstance, it is difficult to improve the relationship between Okinawa and the Japanese government. In the Hatoyama administration of the Democratic Party, he said that ""to outside the prefecture at least. "" I assumed that his remark made US military base problem complicated. The government lost the trust of people in Okinawa. However, I think not only people in Okinawa but the Japanese should consider Japan's future seriously in the 70th anniversary of the end of the war."
NBE05981,"It is very important and difficult issue. We should think it and we must not wage the war again. The Japan of today, people argue security-related legislation heatedly. I want the politicians to argue this issue carefully."
NBE05980,I agree with you. They should avoid such action at the grave ceremony even though they have bad feeling for PM Abe. I think that there are many different ways that they claim their opinions.
NBE05871,"I think it is not too much saying that the jeering at Abe in inevitable. Now his political policy is not agreed by many people. The lowest rate of the support for his cabinet shows this fact. Of course, battle of Okinawa ceremony is so important and should not be interrupted. But, the residents of Okinawa are the people who know it best. The locals who heckled Abe must also have known that. Maybe, they cannot help hitting dissatisfaction to Abe. They wanted to show their anger and disagreement with Abe's policy in public. So, Abe should take this jeering seriously as the local's voice."
NBE05543,"I think jeering Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the ceremony is not good. I guess a complaint of people in Okinawa about noise of American army. And also, I take it granted for they get angry. However, such an action shouldn't be done in the formal ceremony. This news were reported all over the world. Japanese people would be thought as people without common sense."
NBE06730,"The problem of moving US bases in Okinawa is difficult, because everyone don't allow move where they live in. I understand the people in Okinawa angry with Japanese government. That Mr. Abe appeared ignored the beer is good but the government should discuss them about this problem. And all Japanese people should know history of Okinawa and think about the US bases in future."
NBE05872,"Your opinion is very interesting. In Japan, it is rare that people jeer at prime minister rudely at formal ceremony, as the news story said. But, in this case, the local's jeering at Abe is the natural reaction to the policy of present cabinet. And they have a purpose to show their anger to him by daring to heckle rudely him in the ceremony. In formal ceremony, Abe cannot ignore their voices. In addition, I think a little differently to you regarding the presence of US military. Strong connection with America may be taken as hostility by China. So we must discuss it carefully."
NBE07009,The problem that American bases should be moved to main land is very difficult to solve because Okinawa is imposed on too big burden but Okinawa is very important in view of military geography. Therefore Japanese government must convince the people of Okinawa that American bases are necessary to protect Japan.
NBE06249,"I disagree with the policy of Abe administration. If reinterpretation of the pacifist constitution is allowed, Japan would face a crisis of war. Though I have not experienced war, I understand how dreadful war is. Therefore, I never want to experience the war. We have to consider about this issue and try to find out the proper way to avoid the war."
NBE06248,I agree with you. Not waging war is not only important for Japanese people but also people of other countries. We should find out the way of not allowing reinterpretation of the pacifist constitution.
NBE06250,"Surely, it is hard job to remove the US bases from Okinawa. However, I strongly believe that we should put away the heavy burden of Okinawa by removing or reducing the bases."
NBE06613,"I can understand Okinawan posture. They suffer many harms from US troops. But I still think Japan need US bases. If we eject them, Japan will be aim by neighbor Asian country, for example, Korea and China. We can get security and relief therefore we are protected by them. Only Japanese Self-Defense Forces can't protect there. So I agree with Abe's policy."
NBE05634,"I disagree with Abe's quest to end Japan's strictly defensive posture recently because there are possibility that we will be involved in the dangerous situation. Even if he says that we won't be involved in the war, the situation of the future can't be known to anyone. Once the war brakes out, the cruelty of the war stays with people in that generation for long time. In addition, we should keep in mind that people in Okinawa have long been asked to carry a big burden for our security."
NBE05633,"I agree with your idea that Okinawa got and will get too much money from Japanese government and it's not good for there in long term, but I think making new original industry by using given money is important now."
NBE06425,"I disagree with the policy of Abe administration. Okinawa has serious and difficult problems about a lot of US military bases. Under this circumstance, it is difficult to improve the relationship between Okinawa and the Japanese government. The people who live in Okinawa wanted to show their anger and disagreement with Abe's policy in public. So, Abe should take this jeering seriously as the local's voice and should look for a breakthrough."
NBE05544,"I think so , too. Japanese government is forced to take consideration both of people in Okinawa and American government. In this situation, making decision must be difficult. However, if they put off taking measures, the problem won't be solved."
NBE05742,"I agree with you. We don't know about WWII enough. Besides, understanding of history is different by each countries, that have caused many problems. So, we should learn and discuss our nation's history more deeply and mustn't forget the terrible affair."
NBE05743,"I think so too. If nobody complain to Abe, our democracy break down. We shouldn't forget the main constituent of the politics is Japanese citizen. Not politician. ""Abe cannot ignore them"" in your opinion is very important."
NBE07343,"I understand how Okinawans feel, but at the same time I think it is not only Prime Minister Abe's fault. He is doing his best trying to reduce their burden as much as possible as he said in his speech. I hope Okinawans will stop jeering or complaining and instead, we, including Okinawans and others like me should focus on finding out solutions. I would like to think about why the American bases are still in Japan while nobody wants it in his neighborhood. And if we still need bases. where can be used?"
NBE07412,"This problem is so difficult. I think so, too. I think jeering is the act which is allowed. But, you know, this does not make things better. I think your opinion is not bad. but, where is the big island where people don't live. Every governor don't want to undertake American bases."
NBE07413,"Your experience in spring vacation is so nice. The laud sound of a military plane is understood by only people in Okinawa. so, your opinion is so persuasive. We Japanese should think this problem. Where is the best place of the base of America? Everyone doesn't know."
NBE07411,"Okinawa's bases are so many. I thought this is natural, but this is troublesome thing for the people in Okinawa. I think your opinion is correct. But, I think jeering isn't bad. I can understand what you think. I think Abe's attempt is bad, so raising an objection is natural."
NBE07409,"I agree with your opinion. The relationship between Okinawa and the government won't be better. But, I think the relation between Okinawa and America is so strong. This isn't weak. So, what I want to say is replacing the bases of America can't be done. You said, ""Abe should take this jeering seriously as the local's voice and should look for a breakthrough. "" This is the very main opinion. Whether jeering is good or bad is not a problem."
NBE07414,"Your opinions are correct, but my opinion is difficult to yours. I think revising the article 9 of Japanese constitution is needed. Now Japanese Self Defense Forces can't move freely by the constitution. I think this is so bad. revising constitution doesn't equals facing a crisis war."
NBE05744,"I think so too. Many people of Okinawa want to remove the bases, but people in other prefectures also refuse them. However, we cannot easily remove them because the US bases are important to national defense. We should consider this issue by the entire nation."
NBE07410,"I think jeering is the act which is allowed. But, I think this does not make things better. Many people say, ""Replacing the bases of America is needed. But, I want to say ""where is such a place?"" Every governor don't want to undertake such a military base. Also, I think revising article 9 is needed. I think the country which don't have military and the country which can't have military is different. We Japanese must have responsibility of international society. For example, Japanese Self Defense Forces(JSDF)can move if the transportation is absolutely safe. This is so bad. So, we should revise the constitution."
NBE05745,"I think, people complain of not only noise but also more things. This problem isn't so simple."
NBE05716,"When I read the news, I thought people in Okinawa should be calm down to Prime Minister Abe and should not jeer unduly. Of course, I know that people in Okinawa had caught pain and sorrow in WW2. But reproaching to Abe is not produce any good result. And government should be more considerate of people in Okinawa, particularly US military base. People in Okinawa and government should more compromise."
NBE05847,"I'm very surprised at hearing the news. It's generally said that Japanese people don't express our mind clearly, especially in politics. however, in this news, Okinawans express their mind strongly. I think it's great because democracy is protected by positive participations of civilians. But then this means like jeering others is unsuitable. I suggest that civilians participate politics positively and peacefully."
NBE05713,"I felt sad too when I heard about this news. But when it comes to change the constitution, I think people pay attention too much article 9. I think plunged into war is against and agree that Abe should think about how people feel, not how Americans feel or demand, but people should be flexible."
NBE05714,I think Abe should try to decrease the burden of Okinawa too. US military base should move to abroad near by Japan. placing the military base is mistaken utilitarianism for people in Okinawa.
NBE07226,I worry about Okinawa people may think Japanese government is making light of their prefecture. Okinawa people have pride as Okinawan and Japanese. We have to consider the complex feeling of them.
NBE06367,"I want to understand the Okinawans' feelings, but I think those behavior were so rude to the Prime Minister. If they wanted to insist their opinions, they had to have a sense of occasion. Japanese people must not forget the history of the Battle of Okinawa. However, when we talk about it or try to solve problems relative to the Battle of Okinawa, we have to deal calmly with it."
NBE05711,I agree your idea that Okinawa has to grow their economy themselves and make it strong. Okinawa should not rely on US military base forever
NBE06366,"I agree with a part of your opinion, but I do not think that the Prime Minister was elected by the Japanese. If all or most of the Japanese people hoped that Mr. Abe becomes a Prime Minister, so many people do not jeer him. His policy is been criticizing by many Japanese from long ago. That is a serious problem. I think it is also a problem that many young people are not interested in the Japanese politics. Therefore, the Prime Minister and the Japanese citizen have to make a better policy for the future in Japan."
NBE06189,"The Battle of Okinawa is the big matter which Okinawa people can't forget. That evidences have existed in Okinawa. I think that the most biggest negative legacy is USA camps. these camps are danger of Okinawa and support for Okinawa economy. If Okinawa need USA camps is issue that Okinawa should decide, but I want that Okinawa people live happily and safety. Finally, I think all of Japanese should not forget the Battle of Okinawa and that war."
NBE05656,"I am against an opinion of Abe. I worry about Okinawan, so I empathize Kakazu. He said "" It was innocent civilians who suffered"". I think that is right. In the first place, I dislike Abe's think in recent. I don't want to go war, so we must not do war. Now, we think this issue."
NBE05952,I was surprised to read this article. I have been thinking that Japanese people don't express their feelings strongly in public. I think that means they can't stand it any more. we should reconsider this matter seriously.
NBE06187,I think so. Jeering produce nothing. There are possibility to occur emotional confront between jeering people and jeered people. They should discuss that issue calmly.
NBE07038,"I think US 's Okinawa bases should be moved. Of course, historically, Okinawa was not belong to Japan and Japan conquered Okinawa at war. In the same way, US conquered Okinawa at WWII. Therefore the problem of US bases is partly inevitable. However people in Okinawa is suffered from the problems which US bases cause. The government should consider the people in Okinawa at the best."
NBE05658,I think your opinion is true! This news is very difficult problem. I dislike Abe's opinion. He doesn't make new better solution. His opinion jeer Okinawan. I understand Kakazu's objects.
NBE05657,"I heard this news, I think that it is difficult problem. I think We decrease burden of Okinawan. Replacing the bases of America is needed. This sentence is very good!! Your opinion is very interesting and true! I talk about this problem with you."
NBE06909,"I can understand that people in Okinawa criticize the policy by Prime Minister Abe. This is because the people living in Okinawa have had a very unbearable experience since World War II was finished. But we cannot answer where we should let a US base in Okinawa move. Even if the government moves the base to other areas of Japan, this isn't the truth solution since the local people living there start to criticize the government. I think that I cannot but have people living in Okinawa endured this problem until Japanese Government succeeds in negotiations with the US Government."
NBE06551,"I feel it difficult to move US military facilities from Okinawa at the moment. Indeed they must be moved from Okinawa, but it can't be solved between only the Japanese government and Okinawa Prefecture. Maintaining the good relationship with America is aiso important. And the Japanese government has not found new places to move them yet. In any case, I think, Abe should restore Okinawans' trust and attempt to repair the relationship with Okinawa Prefecture."
NBE05899,"I think that criticism for government should be done in appropriate way. Even if the insistence is right, they should not say in formal ceremony, because it is annoyance for many people who want to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the end of the battle of Okinawa."
NBE06795,"When I read this article first, I that the Okinawans are imposed on a big burden. At the same time I thought that this problem was a difficult problem to be concerned with both diplomatic problem with the United States and problems of the domestic administration called the correspondence to the objection of citizens of Okinawa and inhabitants of other base laying proposed sites."
NBE05950,I also think it is very difficult issue.
NBE05900,"Your opinion is definitely sure. But I think people in Okinawa make a profit too. When I tripped to Okinawa, I was taught by local people that many people work at the store near American bases, and if they were reduced, their jobs were reduced too."
NBE06794,"I think so, . Nothing is settled only by jeering and thinks that the situation does not advance at all. I think that the people in Okinawa should take a little more political method."
NBE05901,"Your opinion is definitely sure. But think the right of collective self-defense should be permitted because it is permitted in public international law. Quite a lot of countries have the right now, but almost of them do not go to war. I think Japan will not go to war either as soon as it is permitted."
NBE06152,"I am against war. I am from Hiroshima. So, I learned about terror of war when I was an elementary student. Not only people in Hiroshima but also people in Okinawa Learned it. Therefore, people in Okinawa don't want there to be another war. If Abe pushes ahead with plans to reinterpret the pacifist constitution by all means, he must explain the safety of it to the Japanese people."
NBE07286,"When I read this article, I was very surprised. Indeed people in Okinawa are very angry about government action. But they have to be more serene."
NBE06107,"I agree with you. I really looked the US base in Okinawa, I think that it heavy burden for people who live in Okinawa."
NBE07256,"I think so. This is difficult problem, so we should consider new solutions to solve this problem."
NBE06110,"Thank you. I can't say that the best place because I don't know about this problem. I think that other people don't think about this problem, too. Therefore Japanese government should make opportunities to think."
NBE06108,I agree with you. This is very difficult problem. However we should think about this problem. I really looked US base in Okinawa and I feel that it was very dangerous. I think that Japanese people should go to Okinawa and look US bases really.
NBE06454,"It is ceremony to give a silent prayer to a person killed in battle of Okinawa. They shouldn't have taken a subject of the timely politics and discussed about it, much less jeer. I think that the citizens of Okinawa should have shown memorial will to a person killed in the war. The problem of the base transference establishes the place elsewhere and should be argued."
NBE06151,I agree with your opinion. I think they should have acted after having considered how their actions are considered according to others. They might be better if they were calmer.
NBE05573,"It is true that Okinawa has burden and must be relieved. However, jeering is not smart. They should talk more carefully."
NBE05570,I partly agree with you. But Mr. Abe don't think about only Americans. He must think about Japanese too.
NBE05566,I agree with you. Keeping peace is very important. And we must discuss how peace is kept and we should do.
NBE06672,I think so. Japanese government must consider both of people in Okinawa and the USA. This problem is not only about people in Okinawa but also for all Japanese people.
NBE05567,I agree with you. The problem is Okinawa got and will get too much money from Japanese government. And I don't how much money they are given. I know just now! thank you!
NBE05574,"Your experience is so persuasive! If my house were near the base, I might feel fear. We must think about the current Okinawa people's feeling,"
NBE06338,"I think that it's a very difficult problems, too. I oppose Abe's policy. Why does he do such a. thing! And American military affairs should not only the problem of Okinawa."
NBE06039,"I think this problem is very difficult. To solve this problem, it is necessary to agree by most of Japanese. We have to think what to do for this problem."
NBE06395,I think Okinawan's replay is very good. Because they can speak freely to politician. This country is liberal. l
NBE07124,I think Abe's policy is selfish. Abe must think okinawan people and environment.
NBE07445,"I think Japanese people who do not criticize people in public got angry and, jeered meant misery of people in Okinawa."
NBE05174,"I felt it was so difficult to solve the problem of the U. S. army in Okinawa after all. The problem has been discussed for a long time, but still now, Japanese people and the government push the problem onto only Okinawa. Therefore, we have to know about the present situation there and insist our opinions strongly. For example, with SNS, we can criticize and argue with people all over the world about the problem. Many criticisms can move Japanese government and also American one, I hope."
NBE05045,"Shinzo Abe is in a very difficult position now. Japanese usually don't do the jeering like this so Okinawans have a great frustration, I think. This problem is treated as a problem of Okinawa and our government but this is a problem of all of Japanese people. This recognition is important."
NBE07379,"I agree with you. Most Japanese tend to think it is a problem of Okinawa, but they should think it is a problem of whole Japan."
NBE07472,"I agree with you. I were also angry with Prime Minister Abe's idea, if I lived in Okinawa. However, if we think of nothing but our own interests, we can't decide how to do from now on. So this is a really difficult problem."
NBE07309,"I partially agree with you. Strictly speaking, jeering about political issue is not suitable at the solemn memorial service. So people might have to mind their languages. However I can understand their feelings. They may be too dissatisfied about the American military bases in Okinawa to behave in a disciplined manner. Even if the way was wrong, their strong feelings must have reached Abe. I think it was valuable thing."
NBE06223,"I also think they appealed their argument in an improper way, and they should have taken other one, if they really want their opinion appreciated and supported by the general public. They should take into account the fact that every opinion is evaluated with images they make when they represent it. Anyway, we Japanese did elected Mr. Abe indirectly, and we have responsibility to continue criticizing what he does. And I think he manages relatively well in many fields so far except for the present constitutional question, considering the fact that no politician could make all the current Japanese political problems solved completely."
NBE05295,This problem is so difficult for America and Japan. The best way I think is American's Army leave Okinawa to remove Okinawa's dissatisfaction. However it is hard to realize this idea because of America's pressure. I think any prime minister maybe can't find perfect answer.
NBE05294,"I agree with you. We have to know the president, Okinawa's and Japan's situation for the future."
NBE05152,"I think Shinzo Abe should think more deeply about the problem of Okinawa and America. To reduce a big burden for people of Okinawa, he and us have to think about the solution. I think to solve the problem completely is very difficult, but we should do in the position of people of Okinawa. So we do, Okinawan people's frustration and anger will be reduced a little bit about the problem."
NBE05128,"These days, more and more Japanese people especially young people lost interest toward politics. According to this article, prime minister Abe isn't respected. I guess we should be interested in politics and our prime minister's action, then will find new ideas how to deal with this matter."
NBE05474,"This problem is very difficult but all Japanese people have to think about this as a Japanese people. I think the problem happened from the history state will not solve completely. Many people have various thinkings about. Abe should think more carefully about this problem. Now, the relation between America and Japan is good and they should help each other for the future. Also, we should think about Okinawa people mainly. Their pain may have continued long time."
NBE06453,"I think so, too. In rivalry with each other, the discussion with cursing and jeering cannot produce good conclusions. I want them to perform a calm and careful discussion."
NBE05340,"I think this problem is difficult. But I think Japanese government should more think seriously about US military facilities in Okinawa. I think that Abe should think about how people feel. it is difficult to solve this problem, but Abe should host more meetings about American bases in Okinawa."
NBE05078,It is difficult to solve the problem. But Prime minister Shinzo Abe didn't enough explain. the point is so bad and he should more effort to be understanding the problem .
NBE05210,"I think that it is complicated problem. As you know, we don't want to be included in a war, but Japan has to solve another problem, American military base in Okinawa. Mr. Abe said that we should reduce the difficulty of American base by changing our constitution. I suppose that it is the last way we decide. It is risky to change the constitution. To sum up, we had better not change the constitution. Saved by The USA is the best way."
NBE06854,"I agree with you. Certainly, we have not to blame heavy burden on only Okinawa but there is very important place for Japan's defense strategically. In the future, China's act of aggression will more harsher than now I think. We can't defense our nation only self-defense forces so we have to cooperation with US military and they need to place the base in Okinawa. We must discuss about this problem carefully."
NBE05238,"I also think that this problem is difficult. I think we should take away heavy burden of Okinawa, but US troops are necessary for Japan. If we move this into Honshu, the people in the land will disapprove. We should think about this problem carefully."
NBE05311,"I think the problem about US troops in Okinawa is very difficult issue. Primeminister Abe's determination is not in accordance with Okinawa residents' views, so it was natural that Abe was jeered by people in public. they have rights to insist their opinions to him. But the top man in Japan should not be like this situation people have big discontent of dissatisfaction. Japanese people have to think more about the Okinawa problem"
NBE05310,I agree with your opinion. Japanese young people should have more interests toward Japanese politics and have more knowledge and opinion to politics. Young people can active to insist their opinion with more liveness than older people. Young people's activity can change Japanese politics.
NBE06488,"I partially agree with you. I sympathize with people in Okinawa. However, they should not shout ""Go home!"" in such a formal ceremony. I think the discussion with jeering get serious the relationship between Okinawa and the government."
NBE06765,"I felt sad when I read this article, because I think there are some another ways to convey thoughts. We Japanese should not jeer him. I think that problem is so difficult, so Japan should consult carefully."
NBE06764,"I agree with you. This problem is so difficult, so Abe should think more deeply and carefully about it too. And we must be interested in that problem and think deeply too."
NBE05476,"Your opinion interested for me. As you say, in this news, Japanese people who usually can't express their mind express their feeling clearly for Abe. I think it is not a little the number of Japanese people who have a strong mind or thinking for a political problem."
NBE05151,"I agree with your opinion. In Okinawa, there are a lot of people who are suffered from US troops. But it is obviously, Okinawa is very important place strategically. So we have to think about this problem more seriously. As long as we can, we have to think this in terms of people of Okinawa I agree with your opinion. People in Okinawa have suffered from American troops. But Japanese people who do not understand the feeling and the suffering. I have not been there. I cannot feel their burden. Your story about the people of Okinawa is real voice. I think their burden is much bigger than we expect. So we are same the Japanese, we also think about solution to reduce their burden."
NBE06907,"I agree with your opinion. It is so useful a way to express my opinion by using SNS such as LINE and Twitter since people all over the world utilize it. But if you comment on the web, you should be careful not to criticize the Japanese government for the USA military base in Okinawa recklessly. I can understand a little that Japanese government has made an effort to remove Okinawa's burden by continuing to negotiate with the USA. It is certain that the negotiation between Japan and USA hasn't improved for about 6NA years and people in Okinawa are frustrated for a long time. But I think that we should expect the Abe Administration make more effort to solve the problem. What we can do to support the Japanese government is not only criticize Abe's policy but also believe. However, we need to watch whether the Japanese prime minister pursues proper diplomatic policies."
NBE05712,I agree. I thought people in Okinawa should be calm down to Prime Minister Abe and should not jeer unduly.
NBE05715,I think they have to be more serene. they shouldn't jeer unduly.
NBE06646,I gave way to my anger to Abe's attitude to Okinawans when I finished reading this article. Japanese government should make a consultations on the matter of American military bases. Japanese government sticks to their beliefs. That isn't good attitude to another government. I think what is important is not how make Americans satisfied but Japanese satisfied.
NBE06552,"I understand your opinion and I don't want to experience the war, too."
NBE05594,"I disagree with your opinion for some reasons. It is true that some people say that strong connection with America may be taken as hostility by China. However, China is going into the South China Sea and conflicting with the Philippines. And I think that China is unworthy of discussing. In fact, The Chinese Communist Party is infringing on rights of people in Tibet and Uighur. Therefore China is untrustworthy."
NBE06612,"I agree with you. Japan mustn't break the relation to America by any means. But Japanese government mustn't ignore Okinawan opinion because Japanese government adopt parliamentary system of government. I think Japanese opinion isn't definite, so American government doubt Japanese attitude. My opinion is Japan shouldn't lose bases from Japan."
NBE06614,"I think we shouldn't happen war and know about WWII, too. But this problem isn't easy to solve. If neighbor countries attack Japan, we only fight to defend Japan. All the country don't have principle of peace. So Japan must deploy army."
NBE06729,"I agree with you. I think we must keep to remember WWII, too. And we should study the war in detail and tell future generations. About the problem of US based in Okinawa, we must think it steady rather than other people's affairs."
NBE05593,"Certainly, we have freedom of speech in Japan, but jeering at the Prime Minister at the official ceremony should be forbidden. We have rights to elect our representative. If we think Abe is not right, we can remove him for the Prime Minister. If our freedom of speech were not guaranteed such as China, we could jeer at, strike, and kick the Prime Minister."
NBE05592,"Certainly, using SNS and discussing the issue with people worldwide is very important and worthy of promoting. However, at the same time, we must improve our media literacy. On Twitter we can often see people who are deceived by information. We have to know that some powerful people can benefit if we are deceived by information on the Internet."
NBE05596,"To begin with, people in Okinawa (who have Japanese nationality) are Japanese. You distinguish Japanese people from people in Okinawa. It is very wrong. Japanese people and people in Okinawa have the same rights as Japanese nationality. We Japanese should cooperate together to cope with the changing situation in East Asia."
NBE07342,"I agree that it is a difficult issue to be discussed when considering of both Japanese people and relationship with the United States. I think it is natural for Japanese people to pay a lot of attention for the Article 9 because nobody want our country to be involved in a war. However, I understand it is not right to make Okinawa taking all the burdens. People should think from wider perspectives."
NBE05516,"I agree with your opinion. You gave a good example. I think Noise problem is important point, too. There is the fact that people which live in Okinawa can't live comfortably because of noise by American based. So, Japanese government should solve it."
NBE05517,Our generations are being forgotten the memory of World War II . We must not forget it. We have a duty which tells future generations because it will teach important of peace to us.
NBE05597,"When our position changes, our feelings and opinions will also change. As Japanese nationality, I support the construction of a new US base. Today the world is changing. China is threatening the neighbor's countries such as Japan. Japan should reinforce the self-defense capacity."
NBE05598,"You were so splendid to go to Futenma base. As the residential area is near the base, the danger of accidents is left. To remove the danger, the construction of a new US base to Henoko should be advanced."
NBE07061,I think that the Japanese should give an opposite opinion to the Government aloud. And to express an opposite will into the world helps to change the present conditions. But I also think that jeering in the ceremony is not good.
NBE07062,No one wants to allow the US bases in the place where they live. So the problem of moving US bases is difficult. People of Okinawa may feel that they have no friend in Japan. We should make maximum efforts to reduce a burden of Okinawa as a same Japanese.
NBE06523,"However I had known the fact that there are a lot of American bases in Okinawa, I was surprised at what no less than 0.7 of those are. I think Japanese government force Okinawa to bear burdens which is too heavy. Of course, I know that there is no room to set bases in other prefectures, too, though I believe the government must improve this state."
NBE06585,"I agree with your opinion. Since China develops recently, it is no use insisting that it is necessary to allow US troops to stay in Okinawa."
NBE06823,"I agree with your opinion. I have not been to go to Okinawa, so I have not know how Okinawa's dairy life. Reading your comment, I would like to think this problem again."
NBE06524,"What you say is the right thing, but there are no other place which is willing to accept the burden in Japan. I also think that forcing a disadvantage is not a good thing and sharing it is good thing, but no one wants to have it. This is very difficult problem."
NBE07285,"I agree with your opinion very strong. Indeed the noise of the plain is very loud. And The plain flies around the city, there are many schools, companies, people, this situation is very dangerous. But American troops are very important for Japanese international situation."
NBE05846,"I generally agree with your idea. However, my opinion includes a different point. In representative democracy, The Prime Minister isn't elected directly by the Japanese nation. The election of The Prime Minister don't always reflect the voice of the nation at that time exactly. Therefore, I believe it is necessary that people insist on our minds in politics strongly like Okinawans."
NBE05951,I think this problem is difficult too. people in Okinawa want the American bases to leave Okinawa but people in other prefecture will not welcome them.
NBE05690,"The problem of US military base in Okinawa has been one of the most serious problem in Japan for a long time after World War 2. People in Okinawa have been suffered from noise that makes during training and some members of military committed a crime before. It may be true that US military base is needed to continue friendly diplomacy with United states, but Prime Minister Shinzo Abe need to not only pay attention to international relationship but also listen to Japanese people's voices."
NBE05689,"I agree with your opinion that changing constitution is very risky, but is it best way that we are saved by America? The cost of US military base occupies much of the budget of Japan and people in Okinawa have suffered from noise. Like these, there are many problems related US military, so I don't think saved by America is best way. We have to considerate and search another way of saving our Japan."
NBE07191,"the battle in Okinawa was the one of the most cruel battles in WWII. I watched lots of documentaries on TV about this battle and many innocent citizens are murdered. We shouldn't put the American military base in Okinawa since they are some traumas or to say we put them as victim instead of the mainland. Thus it is not abnormal that people in Okinawa protest against Mr, Abe."
NBE07192,"We should show the world that we are not monkeys who only consult someone, but we also can't deny that we are being consulted by someone to be built many basements in Okinawa."
NBE06017,i'm in favor of your idea. I think the USA basses are important for Japanese differences too. because Japan can not attack for constitution. so we need country which protect us. But of course Okinawa people's lives is first of thinking.
NBE05568,"I agree with you. this is a difficult problem. We should think a new solution to solve this problem. I am of the opinion that we should change bases place. However, here are no place where the American bases is replaced."
NBE06018,"When I read this article I thought the USA bases have to be remove from Okinawa. But when I thought deeply , I felt the bases are important for Japanese defenses and OkinawaS economy. Because Japan can't attack to other country, so we need country which protect us. And the USA's soldier help for Okinawa economy."
NBE05565,I agree with you. I saw current rate of Abe. That is less than 50%. I am of the opinion that he should change the stance to the Okinawa's people.
NBE05569,I agree with you. Your idea of moving the base to the island where people don't live in very much in Japan is very good. This can solve a lot of problems we suffer.
NBE05922,"I think this problem is very important for us. Japan have no army, so the link is necessary between Japan and US But I cannot agree with Abe's idea. Japan lost WW2. And this cause Japan to walk to peace."
NBE06941,"I think Mr. Abe try to compromise with Okinawa citizens. this is because when citizen are angry with their master, the master also can't do politics , well. So it is necessary for Mr. Abe to change his thoughts."
NBE05571,I partly agree with you. We should remove the bases in order to keep Okinawa safe. I hear that the percentage of dependent rate which Okinawa economy occupy is about 0.1. I think this is very small. We need not have American bases.
NBE05572,I see your point. But I am of the opinion that the master can do local politics. He should more think about the feeling of people of Okinawa and the merit of country.
NBE06908,"I also have never seen the series of ""Star Wars"". So I didn't understand the relation between Chewbacca and Darth Vader. So when I read the topic sentence at first, this news is funny too. But like your opinion, I think it shouldn't be news handled as a comedy. After we know this news, we have to reflect how we misunderstand about democracy. Anyway, I am interested in your opinion"" If I attract attention, I will do a method similar to them. . . . "" In my opinion, there was not the sympathy about the Ukrainian repulsion to the government. I think their styles of expression are illegal in term of a public election. But after I read your opinion, I reconsidered it a little. Certainly, if they were convinced of a defeat in normal method, I can understand they struggled to won for becoming a mayor in the style. We have to think of this news with taking into consideration of Ukrainian minds not only a law."
NBE06396,I think that Japanese people are liberal. We can shout out the prime minister to his face . This is very good . But I want the government to carry on what they said.
NBE06068,"I completely oppose plans to reinterpret the pacifist constitution. Although unfortunately, I have to accept the size of the US presence on Okinawa for to save the current pacifist constitution. We have found that the base won't be moved off the island now. It is not realistic to materially reduce the US presence."
NBE07225,I partly agree with you. Abe's policy looks radical. But it is also the fact that the current of this world is changing rapidly. The most important thing is we citizen learn what is happening now I think.
NBE06292,I think Abe's project ignores one's opinion who lives in okinawa. That kind of war should never be happened.
NBE06291,"I agree with your opinion. when he govern a country, it is necessary to persuade people carefully."
NBE06793,"I partly agree with your opinion. Though it is true that Abe's policy is selfish, the basic problem solves nothing only by other proposed sites being given if a base is moved from Okinawa ."
NBE06188,"If the American presence leave Okinawa, Japanese Self Defense Force will be stationed in Okinawa. Since Okinawa is located very strategic place. It is only changing from American presence to JSDF for people in Okinawa."
NBE06336,I strongly oppose Mr. Abe's policy. He does not think of Japanese people. The government should think Okinawa's people. They're very suffered from the American 's army. And we should appeal that American's army base is to violate our constitution.
NBE07123,"I agree with you. This problem is very difficult. I think Abe and okinawa's people need more discussion. Because, now, both of them saying selfish claim."
NBE06337,"I think so, too. Japan has constitution article 9. It is our constitution 's core. We should maintain this article."
NBE06224,"I think Mr. Abe manages not so bad in the problem of Okinawa, considering no politician could solve it with no Okinawans and Americans that is supposed to protect Japan discontent. And I also think these Okinawans should hake taken different way from jeering to represent their opinion."
NBE07255,I think so too. It is very difficult problem. People who live in Okinawa want to remove the US bases. So Japanese government should think about this problem carefully and try to get understanding from people in Okinawa.
NBE06940,I agree with your idea that Okinawa has to grow their economy themselves and make it strong. Japan has to be independent.
NBE05921,I agree with you. Japan should not do war
NBE05811,"I'm very sad to hear this news. Prime MInister is the leader of this country and he should be doing what everyone wants to do. But THe reality is so different, he got jeered in important anniversary day in Okinawa. I don't think we should ve changing the Pacific Stance and constitution. He should be doing what we all can be happy."
NBE06040,"This is very difficult problem, I think. Actually, the opinions of all people do not become one, so we have to search the best way that all people become satisfied. It is not easy, but without it, Japan can not become better."
NBE07444,"By using this meeting , we need to discuss the problem about US military camp."
NBE06397,I THINK THIS PROBLEMS TO difficult TO SOLVE. WE COULD NOT SOLVE THIS COMPLETELY SOON. SO WE SHOULD HAVE MUCH TIME.
NBE05778,"Surely, your opinion is right. However, in order to protect our nation, it doesn't needed leave the bases on Okinawa. The claim by Okinawans is about bases in Okinawa, not in Japan. It's natural that Mr. Abe is jeered about this problem."
NBE05175,"I think so, too. I think people in Okinawa are forced to take an important role for the friendship with America. When I went there, I had not heard the sound of Osprey, so I was surprised at your episode. I hope that Abe will try to decrease the sufferings of Okinawa's people, too."
NBE07037,"I partly agree with your idea. Historically there are what the country conquered and what was conquered and what was conquered has burden like Okinawa bases. However, Japanese government sacrifice only Okinawa instead of mainland. we should tackle this problem together seriously."
NBE05382,"Japanese government should work on the problem of US military bases in order to reduce them gradually, for I think that US military bases remind people of fear in wartime. Also loud sounds and large land for bases confuse people in Okinawa. It is difficult thing, but government should get on well about this problem for good relationship between Japan and USA"
NBE05369,I was surprised and sad when I read this article. I can't believe the prime minister who is the top of this country was heckled in public.
NBE05367,I agree with you. I think also that American military bases are reminders of fear in wartime.
NBE05368,"I think so, too. This problem should be discussed more carefully."
NBE05475,"Your opinion has a main problem in real. As you say, Japanese government has not found new places to move US military facilities. I also think the good relationship with America is very very important. We have to help each other in the future, but this problem is big."
NBE05501,It seems that Prime Minister Abe will be heckled in terms of his way of government. He tries to do what his grand father could not. It has passed many years since his grandfather's age.
NBE05435,"I didn't surprised at his news, but I was very sad. Prime Minister Abe is too active for this Okinawa problem. His achievements and speech reminds me of the right wing. I hope that he don't be more aggressive."
NBE05434,"I agree with your opinion. I think that Prime Minister Abe is blind to our own opinion and hope. But, American's army are important for Japan, so we cannot be too aggressive or too submissive."
NBE05208,"I think so, too. We Japanese had better learn from failures we made in the past. I don't want to be included dangerous wars."
NBE05209,I think so. Prime minister should hear what people are saying. I think that it is bad ideas to be included to the war.
NBE05339,I tend to agree with your statement . I was very sad when I heard this issue.
NBE05150,"I agree with your opinion. In Okinawan, there are a lot of people who are suffered from US troops. But it is obviously, Okinawa is very important place strategically. So we have to think about this problem more seriously. As long as we can, we have to think this in terms of people of Okinawa."
NBE05452,I have read the article which the crime rate of Okinawa had raised since US bases appeared. Not all crime are caused by Americans. But I think they should be in the island to protect Japan. I am interested in the interest to the moral of a U. S. army.
NBE05451,I agree with your opinion. It is important for Japan to allow the army to stay in Okinawa.
NBE05267,"I think Shinzo Abe should more think Japan. Okinawa problem is very serious. But, I was surprised that people in Okinawa jeered Abe."
NBE05102,"I think so, too. I hope to take the American bases away from Okinawa as early as possible."
NBE05077,I agree with your opinion. I think that Prime Minister Abe should more think and try to negotiate to Us
NBE05635,"I disagree with your opinion, I do not think that the Prime Minister Abe thinks only Americans feel or demand. I think that he makes the best decision in consideration of the situation and future in Japan. Therefore, he should host more meetings about American bases in Okinawa and I want him to reconcile with a citizen of Okinawa."
NBE05812,I think bill gates is so nice a person because he invests a lot of money in charity. And it is surprising that we have to keep two-thirds and four-fifths of existing fossil fuel reserves must remain in the ground if the world is to remain within a 2C rise in global temperatures.
NBE07097,"Climate change maybe is the biggest problem we, the human beings, are facing right now in 21st century. People like Bill Gates who have impact on the world should step up and be the leader. Of course we also have to take responsibility and make the world safe for our future generations."
NBE06702,"I think fusion reactor is one of the future energy resource. Fusion reactor is very deferent from nuclear energy. It use Hydrogen, not Uranium or Plutonium. It put little radioactive waste. It doesn't melt down. I mean, it's so safely. Current technology can't make it, but I hope we will use it someday."
NBE06456,"Photovoltaic power generation, wind-generated electricity have big possibilities. However, these cannot supply energy continuously. The progress in the field of energy is required for economic overall expansion. However, there are three important problems that must be settled. It is cost, stability, and influence on environment. Such a point will have to be solved."
NBE06455,"I think so, too. Bill Gates says, ""I choose the latter if I can realize either choosing ten future Presidents or securing the energy that is eco-friendly, and has low cost"". From this, I can know that he has good personality and understand how he regards an energy problem as important."
NBE06111,"I think that it is wonderful news and Bill Gates is very good person. Resources are limited. For example, coal is left only for 150 years and petroleum is left only for 40 years. Therefore resource is very important. Renewable energy is wonderful invention, so we should make good use of it. If this news spread all over the world, everyone think about renewable energy, so the behavior of Bill is important for the world. I strongly believe that renewable energy should be utilized."
NBE06112,"I think that renewable energy has some problems, too. Firstly, setting up the machine of renewable energy is very high cost. Therefore there is a possibility that electricity's cost becomes high. Secondly renewable energy is very instability. There are also a day when we have no sunlight and a day when the wind doesn't blow. These days, we cannot secure electricity. Finally, there is a possibility which occurs of influence on environment. Therefore I agree with you and I think your opinion is great."
NBE06490,"As Bill Gates mentioned, the current climate change situation is irreversible, and I believe that there should be more investment on renewable energy. Renewable energy, compared to energy derived from fossil fuels are more accessible and has more potential. Therefore, Gates' decision may end successfully."
NBE05599,Bill Gates should be respectable except his business. Investing a lot of money in renewable energy business is surprising and worthy of promoting. I wish the rich did it like Bill Gates in Japan. Now Japan need new clean energy not nuclear.
NBE05600,"You are wonderful to list the example of green energy. Certainly, there are a lot of problems on renewable energy. We must reconsider Japan's electric situations. Whether nuclear energy is good or bad seems to be a fruitless discussion."
NBE05982,I respect Bill Gates and his action because he invest in renewables even though it is high-risk. I think his action will be a good chance which we think about global environment.
NBE06190,Bill Gates is respectable person. He do action which other people cannot do. It is unusual to invest $2BN for renewable energy project. His action will make people think renewable energy again.
NBE06191,Bill Gates is the most rich all over the world. He created Windows and Microsoft corporation. However I don't think this only point make him grate. His other grate point is to contribute a lot of things to society like this article.
NBE06676,"I think it's important thing. It's meaningful for a famous person like him to announce he invest a large amount of money. Probably, we can't avoid a climate catastrophe and that current renewables are not yet close to being able to meet projected energy needs. So his action is very valuable."
NBE06674,"I think it's important thing. It's meaningful for a famous person like him to announce he invest a large amount of money. Probably, we can't avoid a climate catastrophe and that current renewables are not yet close to being able to meet projected energy needs. So his action is very valuable."
NBE06675,"I think so. I think it's role for influential people to announce global problem like environmental issue, but we must consider this problem, too."
NBE06069,"I think it is interesting that Bill Gates invest in green energy technology and research to combat climate change, just for economic benefits. It means coming of the new era when good for environment is good for economic."
NBE07381,"Some people may say that supported by capitals such as Bill Gates to solve the energy problem shouldn't be allowed to fear they will monopolize energy business. However, I think such people ""should"" invest this business because energy, environmental problem is very serious and we must solve it immediately."
NBE07167,"I don't know advancing the construction of a new US base by the governments of Japan and the United States is right or not. If it is not right, we have to prevent Japan from moving in the wrong direction. As Kenzaburo Oe believes and Yoichi Higuchi says, we should believe citizens protesting and support them."
NBE06251,"I believe that the governments of Japan and the United States should not advance construction of a new US base at Henoko. First of all, there are many people who oppose to build new base at Henoko. Japanese government should listen to their voices. Additionally, nature and ecology of the sea at Henoko would be destroyed by building new base. All in all, we have to oppose to advance construction of a new US base at Henoko. We should not only talk but also take actions to protect land and people of Okinawa."
NBE06252,I oppose to advance construction of a new US base at Henoko because Japanese government ignore the voices of people in Okinawa. We should take actions to prevent building new base.
NBE07310,"I can't agree with the construction of a new US base in the Henoko district. Because it may lead to destruction of the environment. Beautiful sea which various kinds of sea creatures live in should be protected. Moreover, the mental burden on the locals will be too large. I disagree with the move to revise national security legislation and the constitution too. I want Japan to remain a peaceful country as it is"
NBE06457,"Around Henoko of Okinawa where the mammalian dugongs of the sea in the crisis of the extinction inhabit is one of the sea areas where biodiversity is the richest in Japan. A human being does not have the right to break the variety into. If Japan and the United States which are a developed country take the lead to perform the environmental disruption while the world sings environmental protection, the other countries must be angry. I think that they should think about not only the political element but also the environmental element and should make a conclusion for the issue of transference."
NBE06458,"I think so, too. Environment is not the thing which a human being may destroy. In addition, the human being grows by nature, and anyone know that we are healed by its beautiful scenery. I think that the transference supporter should reconsider such a natural idea."
NBE06491,"I oppose to advance the construction of a new US base at Henoko, too. Now, the relationship between the Japanese government and Okinawa is not good because of US bases problem. It is important to discuss the political issues. In addition, I assume we need to think about the environmental issues to protect the beautiful environment in Okinawa."
NBE05603,"I support Abe on this point. The construction of a new US base is necessary for Japan. Protesters are usually emotional and what they say is a little worthy of listening to. To cope with threat od China, Japan should reinforce the self-defense capacity. The right of self-defense is guaranteed as the natural right. So, there is no problem that Japan exercise the self-defense right."
NBE05605,"To begin with, there was an agreement with America. The Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama spoiled it. If he had not become the Prime Minister, the construction of a new US base would have advanced."
NBE05601,X= people in Okinawa necessarily disagree O= people in Okinawa do not necessarily disagree
NBE06554,This is the first time I've heard this. I oppose the construction of a new US base. We should protect nature and beautiful scene. I think it good that famous persons like Oe take concrete action. And Japanese government has to lend an ear to the voice of the people living in Okinawa.
NBE06553,"I think so. If more US base is construct in Okinawa, it will impose a burden on Okinawa. And the friction between Japanese government and Okinawa will worsen. So, I think Japan and the United States should not advance the construction of a new US base at Henoko."
NBE06114,"I often go to Okinawa. Seas in Okinawa are very beautiful. We can look fish which is swimming because water is very clean. Therefore I strongly believe that we should protect the nature in Okinawa. In addition I really looked Okinawa US base. Then I was very surprised because airplane was very fast and very noisy. I think that US bases are very dangerous and harm for people who live in Okinawa. All in all, I think that we should think about US bases and produce the solution."
NBE06113,"I agree with you. Sea in Okinawa is very beautiful and there are many farms of sugarcane. I strongly believe that we should protect these nature. If we set up the US base in Okinawa, it connect to destroy the nature of Okinawa. In addition, US bases are very dangerous. Therefore Japanese people should insist that stop to set up the US bases in Okinawa."
NBE05606,"Unfortunately, I have never been to Okinawa. However, I often see clear sea in Okinawa on TV and the Internet. Nature is great and respectable. If China attacked and occupied Okinawa, a lot of factories would be constructed. The factory would emit toxic sewage and smoke. Therefore transparent sea in Okinawa would be destroyed. To keep the clear sea, the construction of a new US base is necessary."
NBE05602,"I disagree with Kenzaburo Oe for some reasons. It is true that some people say that the construction of a new US base will spoil clear and beautiful sea in Okinawa. However, China is threatening Japan with the navy today. So, Japan must more cooperate with America. And protesters such as Kenzaburo Oe do not show a concrete counterproposal. They are emotional and sensational."
NBE06368,"I know it is not a good thing for Okinawans, and many Japanese people disagree with the new base construction in Henoko. However, although the Japanese people disagree with it, nobody help them. Any prefectures give their name in place of Henoko. Therefore, this issue does not advance for a long time. All governors in Japan should discuss about it, and if they cannot solve the problem, the Prime Minister Abe has to try to discuss with the US"
NBE05604,"Natural selection is inevitable. If the construction of a new US base were called off, it would be easy for China to attack Japan. If China attacked Japan, as a result, nuclear weapons would be used. Human beings would be extinct by nuclear weapons. Is it a natural selection? God knows it. However, we must keep the prosperity of human beings. Therefore, Japan should reinforce the self-defense capacity for prosperity of human beings."
NBE06885,"I think this movement which famous people take the lead in insisting on peace is very effective because people tend to be influenced by them. People in Nago may be encouraged to have hope by them. Recently, the government of Japan attempt to change the interpretation of the Constitution, especially, Article 9. However, many people are against this idea. I think we should protect Article 9 just as it is because it is a symbol of Japanese peace. It has passed 70 years since the Second World War was over. Let's take advantage of this opportunity and think about Japanese future developments."
NBE07193,"I totally agree and am with Mr. Oe's position against the construction of US military basement in Henoko since it seems that the government has not learnt we have so criticized about the base in Okinawa. Even if Japan are forced to have them because of the lost in WWII, we have to minimize the number of the bases as it produces lots of harms like noise and crash."
NBE07194,"Saying that protesters are usually emotional is so relentless. We, as human, have to"
NBE07195,"Saying that protesters are usually emotional is so relentless. We, as human, have to take priority on thinking about our lives first. And there isn't much threat of China for instance and even afterwards too I think, so we don't have to extend our self-defense power. If we do that, it will irritate other countries of course."
NBE06041,"I agree with Oe's idea, what the Okinawan citizens will win. And I also wish for it. I think the problem of Futenma air station is unreasonable. All people should have the right of living peaceful. So it is very dangerous thing to change the constitution. Not only Okinawan people but also all Japanese people who think so too should try not to happen the situation."
NBE05747,"I think, if China want to attack us by nuclear weapons, they do it although we don't have the Henoko base. That's because Japan have many US bases already. I can't understand why we need more bases with people's pain."
NBE06339,I oppose new American base. Why the government disregard nation's voice. I think that what's he does is Japan before the WW2's government. And Okinawa's things is to reflection the people who live there. What Mr. Oe who works publicly act this like is the important things . Because famous person have a great influence.
NBE06070,"I agree with Oe Kenzaburo, even though I don't like his literature. Although, where will Futenma base move to? It is impossible to move outside the prefecture. I predict that the base will remain Futenma."
NBE07382,I agree with your opinion. We have to protect the beautiful nature of Okinawa.
NBE05129,"I have never been to Okinawa, but I know that there are a lot of problem about World War two and American armies in Okinawa. Henoko's people disagree with the new base construction. I agree with people in Henoko. Japanese Prime Minister Abe must try to discuss about American army with American politicians."
NBE05502,Okinawa used to be a one country since it had own culture. I think Okinawa should be one public culture. But Okinawa's own economic is not enough to support its country.
NBE05813,I do not think it is a good thing to regulate something by the Country! One of the things that surprised me in this article is that two-fifths of Americans oppose the same-sex marriage. In my opinion same-sex marriage should be allowed because we should have right to live and love freely as it is mentioned in the article by Egyptian TV presenter Muna Iraqi
NBE07344,"I never knew that those ideas of rainbow facebook profile pictures are from gay-marriage, but I was about to change my profile picture. I think there are lots of people like me who do not understand the meaning of rainbow. If you really support it, it is right to show or express your feeling in your profile. However, if you know nothing and change the picture, it is just a fashion or trend. I think this posture will make more people angry. I felt gay marriage is always a controversial topic."
NBE06978,"I agree to same-sex marriage because it is the right for everyone to love someone. I have friends who love same sex, and they were very happy to hear the news which the American Supreme Court made gay marriage officially legal in all 5NA states. I think there are not differences between same-sex marriage and heterosexual marriage from the viewpoint of essence which people love someone. So I hope same-sex marriage will be on the way to realization in the world"
NBE07474,"I didn't know that the rainbow is seen as the symbol of the LGBT movement until I read this news article, and I have never seen rainbow facebook profile pictures although I use facebook. Whether we recognize same-sex marriage is controversial and difficult decision. However, I think we should allow homosexuality, because all people have liberty."
NBE06459,"I use Facebook. The profile image of the friend became the rainbow color, and I wondered what it would mean. I did not think that it was the part of the LGBT campaign. I think such a campaign is a good act to spread the interest of people about LGBT following an Austrian signal. However, there is the person who does not know the meaning like me even if uses Facebook. I think that it is necessary to devise the advertising so that a meaning reaches the people. In addition, it cannot be understood why the countries such as Russia object to homosexuality. In the first place a human being is not a simple animal that an object to turn love to is limited to the opposite sex. I think that the person of against the homosexuality country should understand such a thing."
NBE06460,"I was surprised at the number of homosexuality opponents, too. As for the homosexuality opponent, they should not do homosexuality, and I think that there is not the qualification to disturb the love of the homosexual."
NBE06555,"It was very surprising for me that so many Russians opposed same-sex marriage! And I never thought there would be two-fifths of Americans opposing same-sex marriage. Personally, same-sex marriage should be allowed legally. It doesn't cause inconvenience to other people. Nevertheless, those who called LGBT get a raw deal. Even if there is a religious reason, people should be more tolerant to them. I think every person has a right living with someone that he or she likes. I hope same-sex marriage is allowed in Japan, too."
NBE06493,"This movement is very efficient because People all over the world are using SNS now. I think this is same as competent as gay and straight traffic lights in Austria. In fact, a lot of my friends of Facebook became the profile image of rainbow. When I saw this profile image and knew a part of the LGBT movement, I was really interested in this campaign. So, I was surprised that many people in Russia who are opposed to homosexuality."
NBE06253,"I agree with you. I'd like to appreciate our circumstance that we can easily know about the LGBT movement by using SNS. However, I can understand why some Russian people opposed to homosexuality. But, I wish we could understand homosexuality"
NBE05874,"I am one of the Facebook users, so I know about the rainbow flag well. Friends of mine also add the effect on their profile picture. In my opinion, what is surprising is the huge powers of SNS. It is so infectious that the news about this movement spread all over the world rapidly. In addition, circulation of information could be the discussion forums, as the supporter of LGBT-movement in America and opponent in Russia and Middle East. We must pay attention to the infection of SNS in order to prevent these discussion going uncorrected."
NBE05873,"I also think same-sex marriage should be allowed legally in Japan. But, when we come to think of strong opponent in some people in the world, it must not be introduced until we discuss enough, and develop legislation. And it is not necessary to introduce this system in all countries, if there is a special and rational reason, such as opponent by many religious people. Considering each countries' situation is important."
NBE06492,"Thank you for your reply. It was a shock to know that some Russian are against same-sex marriage, too. This movement is giving Japanese people an opportunity to think about homosexuality!"
NBE06115,"Recently I was very surprised because friends' profile pictures of Facebook changed rainbow color. However I couldn't understand why everyone change the profile pictures, so I research on the internet. As a result it is symbol of LGBT movement. I expect that a lot of people research the meaning of rainbow color like me. Therefore I feel that this is not only good for show the meaning of the blessings but also people of the world to know about LGBT like ice bucket challenge. I hope that a lot of people should know LGBT and I have to get the knowledge of LGBT."
NBE06370,"I think so too. People in the world have to make equal societies together. If we do so, we must try to understand people who are LGBT. Also, we do not have the right to oppose their marriage if we stay clear of them. I think most of the two-fifths of Americans in the topic are not interested in the gender problems, so people have to try to know problems that people who are LGBT have."
NBE06369,"I did not know that the symbol of the LGBT movement is rainbow color. It is interesting and a unique idea. I think it is a good incentive for the LGBT people. However, if many LGBT people add a rainbow effect to their profile pictures on the Facebook, those people may are blamed by anti-LGBT people in public. Therefore, if people reveal their name on the Internet, they should consider that, and we also should consider the gender problems of them."
NBE05903,It's an inevitable problem to permit gay marriage. It's natural that many people are negative to it in terms of their cultures. I think that we should start to think about the meaning of marriage again.
NBE05902,"I agree with you. Facebook is a very convenient SNS, so we use it without thinking seriously. We should regard it as a tool of express our opinion."
NBE05923,"When I read this article , I knew there were different ideas about same sex marriage. I think this trend ; the American Supreme Court made gay marriage officially legal in all 50 states ; is good to many people. But there are no people who think this trend is not good. This problem is difficult and we should more effort to spread idea of same sex marriage."
NBE07383,"I think so, too. Same-sex marriage should be allowed freer than what it is."
NBE05130,I think there are various way of thought about same sax marriage. But I think it is wrong to have bad image on the ideal of homosexuality without thinking carefully. I hope all of human have proper rights to live happily even if they are homosexuality or not.
NBE07098,Self-driving cars have being people's dream for more than 50 years. I am sure that everyone in the world dreamed about having a self-driving car. I am both surprised and excited when I first time heard a news about self-driving cars. Safety problem still exists but when this difficulty is cleared self-driving cars will be a new common sense.
NBE07384,"According to this article, I think self-driving cars are safe, but I am not so much interested in it now. Indeed, it was the one of many people's dream. However, it has been unwanted for me since I got my driver license and knew the pleasure of driving."
NBE06703,"I think ""hacking"" is biggest problem of self-driving car. Self-driving car has to connect to internet every time due to download map data, traffic data, temperature data, and so on. In that process, if someone would break into the car system, he ware possible to access driving-system. It's extremely dangerous. If he or they were terrorists group, I can't imagine the injury. Automotive companies face very difficult security problem, but it's good opportunity to improve security research."
NBE06461,"As for the development of the self-driving car, safety is always regarded as important. Two self-driving cars did not clash with each other this time, but will not avoid the accident if self-driving cars increase in the public road. I think that I want them to aim at the realization of the automatic driving car after improvement of the further precision because two automatic driving cars did not have the malfunction."
NBE06462,"Because I do not have a driver's license, I do not understand it, but there seem to be many people who make a drive a hobby. When a company pays more attention only to the development of the self-driving cars and does not pursue the comfort of the common car, I think that I feel sorry for the people."
NBE06766,"When I read this article, I changed my thought to self-driving car. I thought self-driving car is not safe completely before. What two self-driving cars avoid each other is amazing."
NBE06731,I was surprised at self-driving cars are certain to safe. I haven't known the test till read this article. Efforts of companies making self-driving cars will be rewarded and these cars will be common in 10 years. But we should drive the car carefully whether the car is a self-driving car or a car.
NBE06116,"I was very surprised when I read this article. I think that development of technology is remarkable. I do not have driving license, but a lot of my friends have it. Therefore I want to it. However, if we can ride self-driving car in the future, we do not need the driving license. I think it's wonderful if accident decrease, but I am fearful that riding self-driving car."
NBE05780,"When I heard this news I felt terrify because I believe the safety of self-driving cars. The development of this new technology will caused many merits, but Today's companies' method is wrong. They see only the goal that prevail this new things. So, I think the process for the goal is important. In this world, it's difficult to do something rightly all, but they can make an effort to do rightly. In this article, this case is used for raising the trust for the self driving cars. Don't you think it is not correct? There is some accident as for it, but this is unlikely to see the light of day. The company should improve their existing thing before developing new models."
NBE05814,"I have the exactly same idea too. I was surprised and I got excited when I read this article. Even though safety problem still exists, we should make use of these systems when the problem is solved. Though I wonder if we need a license for self-driving car, because you are actually not driving."
NBE07417,"When I read this article, I think self driving cars have terrible aspect. People doing research don't complete self driving car's system. I want them to enhance this new technology's quality. Also, We have believed such a wonderful car. Self driving car is the dream of many people who love cars. But, some people are worried that there aren't drivers licenses. I think that's good if people don't drive because there won't be any terrible accidents."
NBE07416,"I think so, too. Self driving cars are not safe. I think we cannot driving safely without being careful. The researchers must do more and more experiments not to happen terrible accidents."
NBE07415,"I think so , too. Self driving cars are not safe. I think we cannot driving safely without being careful. The researchers must do more and more experiments not to happen terrible accidents."
NBE05503,"I know how you think!! If we depend on self-driving, it ensures that our lives is safety. But what is the point of getting license since then??"
NBE06256,"I felt very sorry to know such a sudden and big typhoon caused such calamity in areas of eastern Japan. I have not experienced such a typhoon or disaster, so that I cannot have a clear image. However, I strongly felt that the evacuation order by public office was late to reach people there. So, it resulted in widespread damage. Therefore I hope that the evacuation order should reach quickly to decrease damage."
NBE06983,"I agree with you. I think it depends heavily on evacuation orders whether a lot of lives of disaster victims can be saved or not when terrible natural disaster occurs. I experienced 'the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake (March 11 2011)'. At that time, Critical infrastructure was severely damaged by the earthquake in my hometown. So we always concentrated on listening to the evacuation orders on the radio. I heard that my friend couldn't survived from Tsunami without the evacuation orders on the radio. Therefore I agree with your opinion which evacuation order should reach quickly to decrease damage."
NBE06984,"I agree with you. I think it depends heavily on evacuation orders whether a lot of lives of disaster victims can be saved or not when terrible natural disaster occurs. I experienced 'The 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake( March 11 2011). At that time, Critical infrastructure was severely damaged by the earthquake in my hometown. So we always concentrated on listening to the evacuation orders on the radio. I heard that my friend couldn't survived from Tsunami without the evacuation orders on the radio. Therefore I agree with your opinion which evacuation order should reach quickly to decrease damage."
NBE06827,"I felt sad to know the disaster. The town of Joso, Ibaraki Prefecture, is near my grandmother's house, so I was shocked to watch flood on TV. When the disaster was happened, I was in Tochigi. In Tochigi, there are many damages too. For example, the water supply was cut off near my town because of rain. And, I think that education and announcement to the disaster was not enough. In the result, there are people who were late to take refuge. However, the rescue by the Self-DefenseForces and cooperation among residents ware great."
NBE07349,"I am very sad to hear and watch news of natural disasters in Japan. I still cannot believe this happens in the same country. At the same time, I learned a lot of things from the news. For example, we should never go back to our home to take something important because our lives are the most important. I also felt it is reassuring to know rescue team like Ibaraki's DMAT. I think the ties of local community are getting lost as Japan is urbanized and so I hope people can help each other at any time."
NBE06121,"I was very surprised when I read this news. I think that I should think about solution in the case of the flood. Nobody know that when the flood comes, so everybody think about solution. I talked about this news during class, then one girl told me not to drive a car if a flood happen. I thought it a good idea. I intend to check an evacuation site and refuge course. There is a river near my house, so it is very dangerous. I want to talk with family about a way to evade."
NBE06120,"I agree with you. Many typhoons come to Japan, so a flood is easy to be caused. When a typhoon comes, it is important early to evacuate. Therefore everybody should check an evacuation site and refuge course. Moreover Japanese government provides evacuation sites. All Japanese people should know this news and everybody should think about what should we do when a typhoon come. I agree with you. I often use internet for watching movie on Youtube and listening music. However I don't know it is an illegal act. A lot of people use internet for watching movies and listening music like me. Almost people does not download movies and music. It's difficult to understand a law for the general people, so I think it's better to increase more chances to learn a law."
NBE07478,"I felt really sorry about the disaster caused by a typhoon in Joso, Ibaraki prefecture. And I was dreadful, because I live along the Tama liver. The awful flood was a shock to all people in Japan, and gives a lesson to us. For example, a city hall should have ordered a citizen to evacuate, and people should not have thought themselves to be safe. Many typhoon hit Japan every year, so the flooding like this may cause us so much trouble again. That's why we should take measures to deal with the situation. Lastly, I hope that the region which suffers from flood can revive completely."
NBE05662,"I read this news, first I felt very surprised. This is news when large rain fell in North Kanto. Kinugawa overflowed under this influence. I watched this news in my house. Many people will criticize it by this disaster. The method is a helicopter, a ship. I thought that I did not want to experience it. The flooding of the river was like the tsunami. The flooding of Kinugawa was slower than a tsunami of Fukushima. The damage has a bigger Fukushima than Kinugawa, too. But, it is terrible when I think that this cause is a typhoon. Because it is the thing that is possible for me. There is the Tama River in near my house. It will become like this disaster if this Tama River overflows. However, it may be said that it is activity of the Self-Defense Forces to have had few dead people. I respect the people of the Self-Defense Forces very much. They went on fighting the rescue at the risk of their lives. They are very cool. I will help me if have a disaster us. By this disaster, I realized the importance of the Self-Defense Forces some other time. I cheer Self-Defense Forces. 200 wards"
NBE05153,"I live in Ibaraki. And my father was born in Joso, Ibaraki Prefecture. So my grandmother's house is in Joso. My town is Tsukuba. Tsukuba is a near Joso town. When this massive flooding happen, my grandmother evacuated to my house because of rising water. She stayed my house for 5 days. After that my family helped to clean her house. But I feel it was good because my grandmother is living. Some people died for this disaster. And I watched the TV show about this news every day. I was so sad because it was different landscape which screened in the TV from that I knew. But now, that place gradually revives. I want to support something for that place."
NBE05245,"I feel sorry to hear what happened in Ibaraki. The picture of the article shows how terrible it was and it reminds me of 3.11 earthquake and tsunami which attacked Iwate and Miyagi prefecture. Many people suffered from each disasters. This time, there are not so many people who were heavily injured, but most of people living in Joso lost their home and necessities because of the flood. Some people criticize mayor of the city and they claim that mayor has a major responsibility for the disaster. It is true that he is responsible for this disaster, but no one could anticipate such a heavy rain fell and the banks of Kinugawa burst due to the rain. I think people have to think not about the responsibility for it but about solution how to help people who lost everything. To help people is a matter of the highest priority. Also, authority has to consider about the disaster and the way to prevent the disaster like this next time. I hope Joso to be rebuilt as soon as possible."
NBE05244,"I agree with you. No one could expect such a terrible disaster to happen, so education and announcement for the disaster was inadequate. The authority should not forget this disaster, and they should learn from and act on the lessons of their failure. I hope them to think seriously about the incident and find great solution to help people as much as possible from such a heavy disaster."
NBE06497,"I felt sad to know again the danger of the natural disaster. Abnormal weather conditions like unexpected torrential rain have recently become rather normal in Japan. Local government should make full preparation for sudden natural disasters. It is important to evacuate and support materials promptly in particular. People who live near the river should confirm the evacuation center with family in advance and store food for two weeks. Not only the government and municipality but we also must be prepared for the unexpected natural disasters. And, I anticipate good use of the drone to supply materials. It is why the drone can carry the goods to the place where people and trucks cannot enter. The manner of drone is uncertain yet and the danger of abusing it. So, I want the government to advance legislation about the drones."
NBE05271,"I felt sad when I heard this news. And I'm sorry for victims of this flood. The day of flood in Ibaraki, this information was broadcast by news programs, newspapers and so on. Some days ago, I watched a document TV problem. A family which live in Ibaraki was attacked by a flood. At first they didn't escape from their house. Because, they had grand mother who is Alzheimer's disease. They left their house and went to a public hall which be located at high place. But water came up rapidly. And the power went out. So they called a rescue party. They were saved. I was scared when I watched this TV problem. And I think I need to get ready for environmental pollution."
NBE05454,"I feel sorry about Ibaraki people. No one can expect this disaster. Japan has many disasters. Hearing ""disaster"", as eastern earthquake in 2011, many people notice some earthquake. The authority said there may happen big earthquake early at Kanto. So many have watched news about it. So we did not think rain cause such a flooding. I read another article about this disaster at Asahi Shimbun. On September 10, 2015, 7 people were died, and 4, 400 household were flooded. I think that government was able to minimize the number of the dead. However, many house or building or their field were damaged. Government should prepare embankments and drainage facilities."
NBE05876,"This article reminded me of the big earthquake happened in Japan on March 11 in 2011, what we call ""higashinihonndaishinnsai"", Great East Japan Earthquake. I am very sorry to the people whose family of friends were killed or are missing. I think what is the most important thing to prevent these tragedy is to be ""nervous"" in a sense. This is true for both government and ordinary people. Above all, government or local public body should develop the laws in order to warn residents to evacuate as quickly as possible. For example, they should make the evacuation advisory at the lower level. In my opinion, they should even reform the entire law system for disaster prevention if the present one is not enough. In addition, the ordinary people must be more nervous; more careful at these warnings. If the level of the advisory become low, there will be much more false information. Even when the TV news report that big earthquake will happen, it may not. But, we must not relieved. No one tells when it will happen completely exactly. We must not ignore the warning and should always pay attention to them. Needless to say, it is ridiculous to be always too nervous. If we are so, we will be able to do nothing but seclude ourselves up in our house. However, we cannot prevent the disaster after it happens. In Japanese, there is a proverb that ""Korobanu sakino tsue"", ""prevention is better than cure"" in English. It is depends on our consciousness whether the evacuate advisory of the lower level will be ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf"" or not."
NBE05875,"I think so. This tragedy may happen to anyone in Japan. Nobody knows when it happen, so we must not think that this is somebody else's problem and we are safe. The best thing is carefulness of each people. This is also said to the other natural disasters such as eruption of volcano and great earthquake. Though governmental or social system for support is certainly essential, the most important thing is awareness of each people. So, the local government must make effort to generalize how we should behave in emergency, especially among children and the old. They cannot escape immediately when the disaster happen unless taught what they should do in advance, then people around them should help them. And I do not think the residents of the region will completely be freed from flood, but they may can escape from it with no damage by preparing for it to some extent. After all, I hope a speedy restoration of the disaster-stricken area."
NBE05785,"I have been thought of this accident as optimistic, but after reading this article, I reconfirm the concern of rain and water which we see unintentionally. We use water on a daily basis, terror of water is not understand for me because I don't experience it. For example, flood, typhoon and unexpectedly strong rain. Most of us don't think rain and river as a real threat, too. In this case, the flood in Tochigi prefecture is rarely catastrophe, which is equivalent to the Great East Japan Earthquake I thought. Surely, it is disregarded because the scale of this flood is small. Regarding the Great East Japan Earthquake, this was a big devastating accident. Many people was killed and affected. While this flood is happened in Tochigi only. However, both is the same natural disaster. That many people was affected is the same thing. A person whose house is poured, a person whose family was killed by the flood, a person who was forced to live in the haven. There is a various people in it. As a result, the same when the accident happened regardless of the number of people. So we should think plan to protect this accident on this occasion. The time to recover the life of the people who living there might be long, so we think properly and do it as possible. At first, we are needed to make a plan from close thing such as caution and discuss with our family."
NBE06739,I think that big natural disaster increases year by year in Japan. I was surprised at the news of Kinugawa gave away very much. There are several causes that damage of this natural disaster has extended. It is to have greatly hit the Japanese Islands directly a strong typhoon so that the first is rare. In late years abnormal weather increase cause of the global warming. A huge typhoon goes ashore in sequence in this summer and is warm so as to be abnormal in winter. I went to the amusement park for an imprudent thing in the typhoon on front of it day. It is the second cause that a Japanese crisis sense is light as for this. A collapse of the river is not an unpredictable thing. The neighborhood resident should have had more senses of impending crisis.
NBE07133,"This news is very pitiful. I went to a training camp of a club at the same time. When returning to Tokyo and seeing news, I was very astonished for a shocking picture to flow. I lived near the river and the sea, so this news was felt very close. I don't know when such terrible accident occurs, so usually, I thought it was important to prepare."
NBE05821,"Since I was in Indonesia in summer for two weeks. I didn't know this news at the time it happened. But I can tell how much damage it made by just looking at the pictures. I feel really sorry for those who got damaged and happened to be the victim. We cannot prevent the natural disaster from happening but, we can try not to get a huge damage. Therefore we should be prepared for those natural disasters."
NBE07421,"I feel sorry to victims of misery flood by tropical storm. The banks and levees of the Kinu River were broken. This is so big storm beyond our expectation. There was nothing to do it. However, I am dissatisfied with the measures devised to deal with. The problem is late of official financial support. However, the government went through huge earthquake of east Japan, they cannot make use of the experience."
NBE06557,"I am sad to hear the news of this flood. When I watched the news, the picture of flood came as a shock to me. No matter how science and technology progress, we can not control nature."
NBE06299,"I am very surprised to hear the news. Japan is faced with disasters such as flood, earthquake, and so on. There are many rivers in Japan, and if we don't have enough preparing, we can be exposed to the thread of flood. Natural disasters can happen anytime, so we should be careful not to be involved in it."
NBE06373,"I brought back the past in 2011 when I watched this news on TV. When tsunami occurred to be caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake, I saw damaged areas on TV every day. I still remember that I felt so confused. I am from Miyagi, so I know some of my friends who lost their family and their home. They are making efforts to live back even now. A national disaster is unable to stop happening, so people can just get emotionally prepared to save their life. It takes a long time to return to their old life, but I want them not to give up. It needs that more people corporate to recovery and reconstruction for victims."
NBE07100,"I totally agree with you. I am very sad and sorry for people who suffered from the sudden flood and typhoon. Even though, natural disasters are unexpected I believe that we can do something to help people who are still suffering. Now is the time for Japanese spirit of caring should reunited. Japanese should be together for the bright future."
NBE06556,"I agree with you. We should confirm the evacuation centers with family in preparation for disaster, such as the floods and the earthquakes. People who live near the river must have learned a lesson from this flood in North Kanto. It is also important for us to put the lesson of past disasters to good use."
NBE05985,"I agree with your opinion. The information about disaster should be announced widely, speedy and exactly."
NBE06980,"I am against the laws because the laws haven't won sufficient public understanding. As Prime Minister Abe said, this laws have a close connection with our daily lives. So I think it is strange that citizens don't understand it well as sovereigns. I want Prime Minister Abe to explain it more carefully and give us more time to discuss it. The Constitution of Japan declares in its preamble that ""sovereign power resides with the people. "" However the bills have already passed into the laws, so we should think how to treat the laws."
NBE06858,"I think these bills must help keeping Japan's peace, people's life, and nation. This bills will be able to make an offer many tactical options of political and military. For example, for these bills, Japan Self Defense Forces (JSDF) can rush to help private citizens when they are in combat zone. Until now, JSDF couldn't help citizens although native. Today, there are many risk of terrorism over the world and we can't know where terrorism occurred so if peoples are caught terrorism, we have to hold options to help these peoples. On the other hand, JSDF will be able to defense other countries forces, especially US Forces. Japan has the Japan-US Security treaty but this treaty is a little slanted. In recent years, Japan's security environment is being sharper and sharper so Japan government want to build up defense capability by strengthening relationship between Japan and USA. I can understand this thinking. I can supports thinking of these bills, but I oppose its because of the ninth article of the Japanese Constitution. These bills has many defect of consistency from the ninth article of the Japanese Constitution so if government want to get contents of these bills, we should discuss amendment of the Constitution and change the articles."
NBE05717,"I agree passed this Controversial security bills because I think there are needs which collective self-defense in a limited way in Japan. Of course, I can understand people who are against the laws. I think Abe haven't won sufficient public understanding too. But I don't understand opinion that railroading of the 'war bills' that constitute a violation of the Constitution by critics. People should not be deceived exaggeration and make dilutions of grandeur"
NBE05176,"I had not have a good image about Shinzo Abe, because he didn't respect the opinions of Japanese and put the law of taxes into force. This time also he passed one law in force without Japanese's opinions, so I cannot come to like him. His decision about Japanese security bills must change its safety, so it is natural that the Japanese get angry. This Abe's eloquent but ambiguous speech had directed Japan to war again, I think. In addition, I think that Prime Minister Abe should make his opinion clearly for the Japanese. Probably, they aren't be convinced, but they can think a little that he has no choice in security bills. This his betting is so risky and might break people's life someday."
NBE05241,"When I heard about the bill for the first time, I disagreed with the right of collective self-defense because it will lead Japan to be involved in a war. However, as I investigated about the right for myself, I could fully understand the right and the bill, I changed my idea to agree with the bill. I realized that the right will be used under limited conditions, so it won't lead Japan to be in danger and also it help to strength the connection between Japan and the USA for the world safety and that of Japan it self. In my opinion, the prime minister Abe should have explained more about the bill and the right of collective self-defense which it includes. If he explains detail about the bill to the public, more and more people will be convinced and stop to abject to the action of the Diet. I hope the prime minister Abe to consider more about his situation and be conscious about the citizen. Anyway, this bill changed the Japan's defense policy and is the turning point of its history."
NBE05240,"I agree with your opinion. I also think that Abe should talk about his opinion more clearly for people's agreement. I don't like his action to pass the bill firmly without paying attention to the public opinion. There was demonstration in front of the Diet for several weeks to show their opposition to the bill, so Abe must have known about the circumstance in Japan. He has to deal with the public who still disagrees with the bill. It is the problem for entire nation, so it should not be ignored."
NBE07312,"I agree with your opinion. It was strange that the governing bloc put the security bills to a vote before negotiations between representatives from ruling and opposition parties and gaining the understanding of the citizens. It was no exaggeration to say that the bills was rammed through the Diet. It is contrary to democracy. Prime Minister Abe were too hasty in passing security-related bills into law. The theme is very important because it will have a big influence on our future. So, I wanted Abe to listen to citizens' voices more seriously. I'm afraid democracy in Japan is becoming a mere name."
NBE06733,I was hearing on the spot the vote in peace special committee of the House of Councilors. While people didn't know what happened the bill passed. It isn't good that this important bill pass in this way. They should not submit together some bills in a hurry. They should discuss each bills carefully and pass them. They need to assess what Japan needs to do or not to do. But It isn't good to opposite simply. We should go next selection and express our ideas.
NBE06857,"I don't agree your opinion because government explain the content of the law and also mass communications reported many information(put thought true or false). Even if you can't understand the bill's content, it is your shortage of studying. Now there are internet and there are many information about it, so if you can't understanding you should research in internet. Join the politics is the duty of nations. You should study from now"
NBE06856,"I agree with you. This bill make Japan's security more safety and stronger. Japan self defense forces have more way them action and it means our security level will go up. Recently, Japan's security environment is going to be sharper and sharper especially in the East Asia. It is better that we have many way to be able to do military action. I also agree with your opinion about railroading of the 'war bills' that constitute a violation of the Constitution by critics. People should not be deceived exaggeration and make delusions of grandeur. Making the way to security stronger is the natural for nation."
NBE06042,"I sure this problem is the most difficult recently and I cannot expect what happens from now on. In Japan, It was a pro and con but Because LDP forced a vote, LDP receive much criticism. To be frank, I think it is natural. I was not able to believe they forced a vote though the Diet is so desolate, you know. By the way, this security bill has the good aspect and the bad aspect, I think. Now there are various menaces in the world. So it is necessary to cooperate between countries, and to get over it. This bill promises it and It is convenient with the aspect. But the other hand, we may be rolled up in the war of other countries. Japan promise not to do not make war in constitution Article 9. However, we may break the promise by the security bills. There is no way for us to know what will happen to it. Young people must make an effort not to worsen. I think that it is up to us."
NBE07126,"I oppose right of collective self-defense. It's because I think there is a possibility that a war starts with using this law. Prime Minister Abe denies its possibility, but I think you retaliate certainly when attacking a partner to protect the people. And I think that's repeated. Japan is very peaceful now, so I think I don't want to break this living. And I'm opposite to how to make them do formation of this law. I think the explanation to Prime Minister Abe's people and other councilors wasn't enough. I thought I wanted you to establish after I spent time and convinced the people and other councilors more."
NBE05816,"I am not against this law but, they should have made the opportunity to discuss about this matter more. Prime Minister Abe cannot avoid being criticized, because I don't think he stepped the right process. I had a opportunity to talk with the professor Mr. Hosoya in Keio University. He is the professor in department of Political Science. He explained us the details about the security bill over an hour and I was pretty convinced by his explanation. So I think if they explain more explicitly for Japanese nations, there might have not be the demonstrations against the law."
NBE06981,"I think that stopping the plan of the stadium is right because much money can be used another way. For example, recently, natural disaster occurred all over Japan. So we can use money to help people who live in the area hit by a typhoon, a flood, a landslide and so on. And I also think the logo of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic is plagiarism. When I saw two logos in the news for the first time, I had no choice but to doubt the logo of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic was copy because two logos resembled each other closely. So I think it is good idea to change the logo because we should make the 2020 Tokyo Olympic special and original."
NBE06341,"I agree to stop the plan of new national stadium. But I disagree that Mr. Shimomura resigns his position. At first, I think stopping the plan is correct choice. Because the new national stadium is built by spending our tax. In addition, an estimate was increasing steadily than initial plan. The original plan, one of the Tokyo Olympic's charms is that price to build the stadium is low cost and it is good for environment. For all that the plan was changed in defiance of it steadily. Then I want to point out that Mr. Simomura's resignation. It surely became a problem that nation was involved. So his resignation is a matter of course. But he has not yet accomplished duty to achieve accountability. My thinking as a one citizen of nation he dose not make the end by resigning the position of minister but he should find the structural mistake of this plan."
NBE05782,"I concerned very much when I read this news article because just one of preparation haven't fulfill yet. I think the organization which couldn't achieve one thing won't success. If various problem is show up from now, Tokyo Olympic would be poor event, finally, It cause a corruption of Japan. Of course, It's a worst pattern, but, I couldn't believe the government perfectly now. After all, the plan to construct the new stadium haven't decide yet. Unless the basic problem is solved, I couldn't think the success of this event."
NBE05132,"I knew about the problem of Tokyo Olympic stadium's problem. It costs so high and it is said that the serious problem in Japan. Holding Olympic costs so high, but I want Japanese government to host great games in 2020 because all over the world's people are looking forward it."
NBE05133,"Sorry, I want to correct my spelling mistakes. I knew about the problem of Tokyo Olympic stadium's problem. It costs so high and it is said that the serious problem in Japan. Holding Olympic costs so high, but I want Japanese government to host great games in 2020 because all over the world's people are looking forward it."
NBE07447,"I think Tokyo Olmpics in 2020 has collected a lot of attention. The first point is the stadium design, Zaha Hadid. She designed the futuristic stadium, which contained solar panel, night purge and something that used high technology. And it needs high cost to build it. I heard from another news that the costs took us twice than expected at first. From this point, I thought who would pay such large money. if Japanese Government told us to pay money to build the stadium, we would get angry because we did not know the budget till it was made public. And if every one living in Tokyo should share , people who were welfare pay the same money as the rich people?Then if poor family pay smaller money than rich people, how do we decide a ratio?From these questions , this plan has a lot of traps . The second one is Olmpic logo. A person who made Olmpic in2020 logo was sued by a designer who made logo of a theater in the Kingdom of Belgium. From this problem, I suggest an idea to make logo by the public . By choosing logo from the public idea , we can have a sense of solidarity. Olmpic project tends to be advanced by the government, so we can not feel the sense to cooperate with this project . Therefore by involving public , they can feel solidarity and this project will not get a head of us , I think"
NBE05407,"I think it is right to stop this plan for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Stadium taking the long-term view. At first, Japan decided to take Zaha Hadid's idea, but her plan needs too much more cost than the previous prediction. Also, it needs many hands and times. From these reasons, I think it is impossible to put this original project into effect. Changing the original plan and collecting the new idea isn't easy, but it is important to think how to succeed the 2020 Tokyo Olympic and do the best as much as possible. Certainly, it is true that there are so many bad effects such as the 2019 Rugby World Cup can't hold in the new national stadium because of this change. In terms of the logo of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic, there are so many problems. It is obvious that the original idea of logo is the copy work. When this problem became obvious, many goods which printed this logo had been produced, so Tokyo prefecture has been suffered. When I first read this problem, I was very surprised and shocked. Thus, Japan has so many problems of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic. I think this isn't the problems of Tokyo prefecture but the problems of whole Japan. I think Japan ought to take action quickly and regain world's trust. Furthermore, we ordinary people also should think about this seriously."
NBE05243,"In my opinion, the resignation of the sports minister for the problems of 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games is right. There are many problems with the Olympics. First, British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid designed for the stadium, but the cost for building doubled and finally it was sent back to square one. The time to have spent thinking about the idea and cost for it became useless due to this decision. The stadium is supposed to be used for rugby world cup, but it will not be realized because of delay. This incident affected various sections. Second, there is a problem in logo for Olympic. A man designed the logo, but it was criticized by Belgium because it is similar to the theater in Belgium so the logo was copied. The logo was criticized by a lot of people, and also other doubt of copied occurred, so now there is no trusty for a man and his company. Japan has to think about logo in addition to stadium from the beginning. In this way, there are still a lot of problems for 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games and sports minister is responsible for it. I hope them to solve the problem as soon as possible to host the great Olympics."
NBE05242,"I agree with you. Japan should use the rest of money for another thing such as natural disaster and welfare. In Japan, there are a lot of disasters. For example, incredible amount of rain fell into the North Kanto and there was the collapse of an embankment in Ibaraki and Tochigi. Many houses and building were flowed due to a great deal of water. Japan should use money for the region to rebuild the area. There are also other disaster-stricken area such as Iwate and Miyagi prefecture, so Japan should help them with money. Furthermore, there is a strong need for welfare in Japan. Japan should think about the problem and instead of using huge amount of money for stadium and logo, they should use money for that."
NBE05177,"This July's plan of Tokyo Olympic in 2020's stadium finished in vain. These plan utilize our consumption tax, so I felt that this news was very disgusting. My family also got angry with the matter. In addition, according to this plan, Tokyo's stadium would have been bigger and more expensive than any of its recent predecessors. The previous stadium was enough great, so it didn't need to be broken. Also, everyone in Japan had expected the greater and neo-stadium, the wasteful plan let the hopes down. Will Tokyo Olympic be held in 2020 without more accidents?"
NBE07476,"I think it is right that plans for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Stadium were canceled. There are three reasons. First, the cost of construction, in the end $2.5 billion, was too high. If there is a vast sum of money, they should use it to do for the Japanese nation, for example, the social security and development of infrastructure. Secondly, the scale of British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid's original design was too large. Is such a large stadium in demand, after the 2020 Tokyo Olympic? In the London Olympics, about 70% of the seats of the main stadium was built temporary, and the stadium was reduced the scale after closing. Some days ago, two new plans for the Tokyo Olympic stadium were announced. I hope that the stadium constructed in actuality will be reasonable. And I think the Olympic logo is misappropriation, because when I saw the logos for the first time, I could not think the two logos were different things. So it is just that Olympic organizers are looking for a new logo."
NBE05268,"I think there are many problems for Tokyo Olympic of 2015. These days, I often watch news of Tokyo Olympic. First is the cost of construction for the stadium. The content of the news is increasing of the cost of construction. At first, the cost is 1625 hundred million. But, later it changed to 2520 hundred million. This is big problem. Japan government should have considered about it carefully. I am anxious about the construction will be in time. Moreover I have some doubts about a source of revenue. Now Japan government borrows money from other countries. Where is money that Japan have? I wonder if the government spent our tax. This is bad. We do not pay tax to establish a new stadium. The second is am emblem. Some months ago, the news of emblem is broadcast like everyday. Mr. Sano imitated a logo of a theater in Belgium. This problem is exceptional case. I think why Mr. Sano imitated. Because, someday this dishonest will come to light. And the government should have noticed this dishonest before they announce officially. In this way, there are some problems about 2020 Tokyo Olympic. Holding Olympic is valuable opportunity. So, Japan should consider and act about this."
NBE06705,"I think there are many things that have been still kept secret. Among the most important is the process of selecting Zaha Hadid's plan in the first competition. Medias have criticized the design of Zaha Hadid so many Japanese people think Zaha has a main responsibility of this project. But, this is totally wrong. First, Zaha was selected as a design supervisor in the first competition, not an architect. Her job was creating amazing perspective of new national stadium that could attract interest of selector of world olympic committee. And importantly, many Japanese involved in this project didn't think Tokyo was elected in Olympic City in 2020. So Zaha's plan was a kind of dream rather than realistic, and that was her job. Second, the specs of it requested by JOC were unbelievable. As their request, new national stadium will have to hold opening ceremony of Olympic, rugby and soccer world cup and track and filed games. And, that had to have amazing numbers of VIP rooms and huge museum of sports history. This museum will be absolutely largest and most expensive stadium in the world because stadium that fulfills these specs was never built in the history. NEVER. For these reasons, the cost of new national stadium reached 2 or 3 billion dollars. Briefly, it is not a responsibility of Zaha. She just performed her job that requested by client, JOC. So, who is bad guy? Maybe JOC, mass media and architects are. JOC had to decide clear budget first and cut some functions. Media had to criticize real ""criminal"". They made Zaha criminal so she was falsely accused. Architects had to claim the fact. Their voice was too small to be realized general people what a fact is. Anyway, I love Zaha's plan. I love the beautiful form. The plan requested highest technology of contraction, and only Japanese general contractors can build it in the world. Zaha's stadium will be supposed to have an amazing impact to Japanese boring design of architectures. It's so regrettable for me."
NBE07313,"I think the decision was right to make a fresh start about the plans for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Stadium. The design was not ideal in terms of cost and time. I think it is the most important that construction of the stadium are completed by 2020 for athletes and spectators. The resignation of Japan's Education and Sports Minister struck me as incongruous. Only he was responsible for a series of the problem? Of course I can accept he was replaced, but I got the impression that the politicians tried to put the responsibility on the others. Then, the logo problem will bring disgrace on our country. I wish that Japan can retrieve its honor by behaviors from now on."
NBE06734,"I was disgusted with the case of the stadium of the Tokyo Olympics. The Olympics are national big events. Therefore you must perform the preparations without a blunder. Nevertheless the construction of the main stadium is stopped now. It is a cause that they were preoccupied with only appearance and they did not look at the footing well. Moreover some adult forces the responsibility each other. It is a very shameful thing. In addition, I was surprised at this case that it is not only the stadium but also the emblem. I did not know the truth whether was plagiarism, but the prior investigation that I did well was necessary. I have cooled off to the Olympics to be the held though it is a special Olympic in Japan. I think that the Olympics of 2020 should be reached from now on without the problems of camouflage and the further money coming out."
NBE06043,"I have a lot of uneasiness about the Tokyo Olympic. Last year, many problem about Tokyo Olympic appeared. For example, a period and amount of money of the construction of the stadium and logo mark used in Tokyo Olympic. These are serious problem, I think. Even if there were still four years, they will not be in time when they noticed in this situation. The construction of the stadium takes time so much, so the person concerned should aim at the completion immediately. Attaching push of the responsibility is a waste of the time. To succeed Tokyo Olympic in 2020, we have to prepare steadily and we should become to be able to cope with an unexpected situation. We don't know what will happen and there are menaces such as terrorism. So we must prepare as possible as we can do."
NBE06706,"Maybe you are right, but I have another idea. Fresh start was totally wrong. It was huge mistake. First, this was an international competition and Zaha was selected in this proses. Every architect in the world are looking this national project carefully and they tend to think Japan is really closed country not fitting the position of world's one of the largest country because Japan bypassed Zaha as a official architect of the national stadium. In construction industry, to over budget is common thing. The job of architect is how to fix the design fitting to budget. Zaha said ""we have many plan to reduce the cost"". But Japanese government and JOC ignored that. The best and only way was to keep using Zaha and making another plan fitting budget. It was too dishonor for Zaha."
NBE05660,"I think that Tokyo Olympic will very fun tournament. But the Japanese government has many problem. One of those is a stadium. Now, the Japanese government thinks that Japan's main stadium is Kokuritsu Kyo-gijou . It is in Gaien. Rebuilding of Kokuritsu Kyo-gijou becomes the big problem. It costs money to greatly exceed a budget. Also, the design is a big problem, too. But I think that the most important problem is that Japan is very hot island. It is unsuitable for the summer Olympics. Japan must solve a problem of the heat. Especially, I think that the marathon is very painful. I think that if Olympic start, some people dead because Japan is very hot. Furthermore, big problems include terrorism. Recently year, terrorism case is very increase. For example, ISIS. Terrorism was caused by ISIS recently in Paris. I think that it is very horrible. However, if Japan does high alert, I may prevent them. I am glad in the Olympics will be come in Japan."
NBE06293,"In 2020, Tokyo Olympic is held. To hold it, we must prepare stadiums. Japan's Education and Sports Minister Hakubun Shimomura planned very artistic stadium, whose budget was doubled against original plan. This kind of stadium is very fantastic , but too expensive for Japan to manage its economy. Before focusing on Olympic, we should do many things. First of all, we must increase kindergartens to raise young children. Now many children can't enter into kindergartens for lack of institutions. Second, we should prepare pension plan properly. If this situations continued, young workers will suffer a huge loss. Third, we should arrange traffic network. In Tokyo, there are filled with people going to work. There are too many people in Tokyo. We must care about internal affairs."
NBE05817,"I do not understand why people tend to resigns when they make mistakes. You have to apologize for what you did. But, is it necessary to resign? Staying away from the problem doesn't solve anything. It just make the situation worse. You need to take an action to compensate it before you quits or resigns. I am wishing for the Olympics in Tokyo will be a successful one."
NBE05783,"I think so. Even the plan to build new stadium is failed, not need to change minister. We shouldn't accuse of him. This change not cause effective settlement."
NBE06707,"You are wrong about where the money building national stadium come from. It's sure that our tax was used for it, but it is 50% of total budget. Another 50% comes from benefit of lottery called ""toto"". Toto is Japanese public gamble for mainly soccer games. And, the 50% of tax was from people live in Tokyo. It's called ""National stadium"", but Japanese government will pay less than 25% of the cost. We have to know this fact end medias should tell people this fact."
NBE07127,"reading this article, I was very astonished. I couldn't understand why the budget was beyond 2 times of the expectation. Olympics is an international sports event and is the meet watched very much worldwide. It's that it's honor very much that that can be held in Japan, so such thing occurs and is very regrettable. I think Japanese international trust is the very big problem that it may disappear. A problem of an emblem has also happened in addition to this problem. I was disappointed. I think I consider a new plan and want you to hold sound Olympics early."
NBE05046,"I agree with you. To make this decision, it can be the good start for new plan. I also think that the former design of the stadium was not so good and too expensive. All the people in Japan maybe feel that it does not have reality. The representatives should listen to the national opinion more carefully, I think."
NBE05383,"When I knew this problem on TV news, I cannot understand why Japanese government decides to spend so much money on the stadium in spite of there being other problems in Japan, such as debts, pension, and so on. In addition, I think the government should have made the decision earlier because the completion of stadium may be just in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic. If the construction of stadium finishes early, the stadium can be used as the rugby field in 2019. Japan lost the opportunity to appeal Japanese sports activity."
NBE06982,"When I heard this news, I was very surprised. Many people and media said that it was difficult for Japan to win this game because South African was the strongest team, so honestly I believed that Japan lost the game. I didn't know rugby very well. However Japan got a dramatic victory and gripped the supporters. As the article said, rugby was a minority sport in Japan, but this victory attracted the interest of many Japanese people. I am the one, too. I felt that I wanted to study the rule of rugby, the players, the history and so on. I would like to support rugby from now on."
NBE06767,"I was looking forward to watching this game on TV, but I had something to do, so I couldn't watch. Next morning, I heard that Japan won to South Africa. That news made me surprised and happy. Most of people all over the world thought South Africa which is one of the strongest rugby team win. I am one of them. I think many people again realized that nobody knows what will happen in sports. Japan rugby team proved that. A goal of Japan is to advance to quarterfinal. I believe that Japan will achieve success. Good luck Japan rugby team."
NBE06589,"It never occurred to me that Japan beat South Africa. It is said that Rugby needs strong build. Japanese is small in comparison with foreigners. In spite of the disadvantage, Japan beat South Africa. I was deeply moved by this news. Through this article, I think that Japan's victory is a good chance to think about immigration policies. Accepting foreigners has good points. First, we can understand different cultures each other. Second, we will be able to think flexibly. Thanks to foreigners, we learn their thought that we have not recognized so far and come to be able to see things from various angles. We should have interest in immigration policies."
NBE05661,"I watched this game that Japan versus South African in the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England on Sept. 19. Japan was win so I was very surprised and happy!! So far, Japan was weak, but this year, Japan is very strong. Why did Japan become strong? It is because Japan accepted migration, cross-border marriage and multiple identities. It may be cancel the immigration issues. In recent year, immigration issues is very important problem in Japan. For example half, Korean, Negro and African etc. . . However, they are very successful who is half people. Rui Okoe is baseball player. He is very successful in Koshien. Next, Sani Brown is runner. He runs 200m very fast. So he advanced to the semi-final. In this way, many half people is successful at sports. I think that this is a very good tendency. Half has been discriminated against so far by a Japanese. But I think that it is very wrong. Multi-national culture will be the normal in the future. I accept this culture. I want make some foreign friends. Therefore, I will study English more harder than now. In 2020 Tokyo Olympic, Half people will very successful and get gold-medal!!"
NBE07010,"I knew that South Africa is one of the strongest in rugby. Therefore I was very surprised of Japan's winning the game of the Rugby World Cup in England. And I thought why Japan team became so strong. It's reason is that Japan team accepted foreign player. Before, Japan team has not accepted foreign player. But now, Japan team positively accepts foreign player and reinforces it's power . So this win is important in terms of not only Japan rugby history but also in multi-cultural society."
NBE05312,"I was really surprised at this news. I did not think that Japan beat to South Africa and some people looked like not Japanese. Generally speaking, the physique of Japanese people is smaller than people in South Africa. When I watched this game on TV, I felt that Japanese team was constructed from a lot of ethnic people. I thought that it is very amazing thing that Japan which is known to the closed nation adopted not only genuine Japanese players but also players who was born in other countries. In my opinion, a player who has great ability should be joined in the team, so that I really agree with this Japanese attitude toward making team."
NBE05269,"I was surprised at this news. In Rugby World Cup, Japan team won South Africa. I watched this game in my house. This news was broadcast like everyday in Japan. Before the game, almost Japanese might think Japan will lose in the game. Because South Africa took third place in the world ranking. But, South Africa was defeated by Japan. It was great. But when I watched this game, I noticed the large number of foreigner player in Japan team. So I research on the Internet. Japan team is composed of 31 people. And 10/31 is foreigner. When I knew this fact, I thought this number is large. So on Twitter, many Japanese tweeted negative opinions about foreigner of Japan team. But, other country's team also have foreigner player. Looking from worldwide, rugby team has foreign player is common. So it is not strange. Why Japan won South Africa? Japanese player are shorter than South Africa. So physical strength may smaller. But I think Japan team exhibit fine teamwork. Now rugby is popular in Japan. So I hope Japan team will more active."
NBE06494,"I actually watched the game that Japan won South African in the World Cup 2015. I did not know the detailed rule of rugby, but I was deeply impressed to be present at a moment of the Japan's historic victory. Many Japanese people must take this occasion to be interested in rugby. I am the one, too. Watching the rugby games, I feel that sports have no borders. And, in the feature program about rugby, the Japan Rugby Football Union's spokesman said that rugby goods, the national team's jersey and cheering goods and so on, sold out quickly and the profits were 30% higher than initial target. I was surprised the economic effects. Japan will host the next Rugby World Cup in 2019. I hope the fever will not die with the final whistle of this year's competition."
NBE06943,"When Rugby World Cup (RWC) was widely known to a Japanese citizen like this, who would imagine it. If there is all the excellent attack of the representative from Japan. The South African representative victory profit that was said to be ""a rugby upset biggest in history. "" For the great upset that Japan caused, a voice of the praise arose from the South African fan of the U. K. and the opponent, and the representative from Japan alumnus was full of the splendid achievement of younger students. Official Twitter of the World Cup that British writer J. K. Rowling of novel ""Harry Potter"" ""could not write such a story"" at Twitter murmured ""an upset greatest in history of the World Cup"" and surprise. By the way, a rugby athlete representative from Japan has many foreign players, do you know that voices of the praise occur successively in their singing Japanese national anthem ""Kimigayo"" emotionally? I did not learn a text simply and learned with all the players about the meaning and did the action that I sang. Is it not one of the notable points that not only the player from foreign country but also the Japanese player wrestles together? I think that there is the solution to becoming the problem for rugby in this way in the global world."
NBE06942,I also surprised by hearing this news. I decide to support Japan's sports. We have to be responsible to do this together.
NBE05784,"Last year we are so excited for rugby. ""Goromaru pose"" is awarded at Buzzwords-of-the-year contest. When I read this article, I was forced to realize that Japan representation doesn't mean all Japanese team. I especially don't know about rugby system, I think most of all are Japanese as a matter of course. Needless to say, The thing that there is a foreigner is not bad thing. I was just simply surprised. Meanwhile, it can be a subject of criticism. As for me, a lot of people don't know this thing I thought. Major reason for admitting this situation is based on rugby's history. For example, in the island country on the South Pacific, a lot of people go out to New Zealand where there is a strong team, ""All Blacks"". We should understand this system of rugby, and then we enjoy to see it. And it is important to be caught by ostensible things, we must think deeply."
NBE06588,"I cannot help jumping for joy. Japan's national rugby team which is called ""the Cherry Blossoms"" or ""the Brave Blossoms"" was not very famous. To be frank, I was not interested in Rugby. I did not know how many players play a match, to say nothing of its rules. However, when I heard the news that Japan beat South Africa. I was very impressed and I want to know about Rugby. On September 23rd, Japan played bravely against Scotland, but lost 45-10, though four days earlier, it marked the historic victory over South Africa in 34-32. ""We're not the strongest team out there but we are definitely one of the toughest. I am proud of the boys and we have to look forward to our next game against Samoa, "" said the captain, Michael Leitch. When I read his comment, I thought that they were so cool. Though they were defeated, they always think next game. Even though opponents are stronger than them, they never give up. I was attracted by their positive attitude. After the World Cup was over, I looked them over. To my surprise, their practice is harder than any other national team. They start to practice at 5am and finish practicing at 6pm. They lift weights and stand up to weight of 100kg. It is incredible that they finish the practice schedule. I think it is the secret that they beat South Africa. The practice produced powerful tackle, accurate kick and fast run. Thanks to their practice, they got a good result. The foreign media paid attention to the result of Japan. Japan was defeated in the first league. The foreign media said that it was a loss. Not only the foreign media but also non-Japanese were impressed by Japan team's play. According to the Japanese media, non-Japanese went to support Japan team and bought Japanese shirt. Since Japan team made a deep impression on them, they came to expect victory of Japan. In spite of their disadvantageous build, they made up for their weak point. They proved that they can compensate their weakness with their skill. That is exactly historic splendid achievement. Japan team gave us exciting rugby. Many Japanese thought that Japan team lose, but they made it. I'll never forget this game. I think that the future looks very bright for Japanese Rugby and Japanese Rugby fan. Since they played some fantastic rugby, I am looking forward to 2019 in Japan."
NBE07128,"I like seeing a rugby game. Rugby had not been played, but my father and younger brother were doing, and I came to like rugby for the influence. Rugby is ability difference was a clear sport, and Japan won 1 by rugby World Cup so far, rugby had not been done. Because such team won against a team of a 3rd place of the world rank, I was quite moved. Japanese representative also kept making a leap attack after that, and I won 3 by this meet. I think that's a really wonderful thing. Japanese representative's players were saying that everyone changed history of Japanese rugby. And the players who accomplished that think it's wonderful. I'd like to follow them and make an effort, too. And I'm hoping to want them to play an active part for future Japanese rugby."
NBE07419,"I was so surprised at this historical achievement. Everyone says rugby of Japanese who are much smaller than other countries like New Zealand cannot win. But, they overcome not only South Africa but also the prejudice to Brave Blossoms. I respect their courage and tough in a pinch. When I was a junior high school student, I got to like rugby because rugby team of our school were playing next to our ground of baseball team. I was watching their playing while the time of club activities. I usually recall their tackle and scrimmage were desperately. I think they may be glad of Japanese rugby was recognized by the world. Before rugby World Cup in last year, rugby is minority sport in Japan, but now many people may be attracted by their brave figures. Most popular player in Brave Blossoms is Ayumu Goromaru. I think his wonderful point is of course technique of rugby and furthermore having the spiritual of wish that Japanese should watch rugby more. So, I respect him. By the way, I wondered why Japanese team has the players who are other races. I thought they are not obviously Japanese. But, when I asked my friend who loves rugby, I can understand the reason. There are three conditions. At first, to born in Japan. Secondly, only one person in their grandparents and parents is from Japan. Thirdly, they stay more than three years in Japan. These conditions are so easy for players. However, we never forget foreigners desperately play for Japan. I think their thoughts for Japan are much stronger than ours."
NBE06294,"Actually, I Watched live on TV about this major historical victory of Japan team. At first , I couldn't imagine that Japan defeated South Africa, but move of Japan team is highly organized and no one neglect each work. The match was so exciting and Both team played well to win the game. Japan team players are smaller than those of South Africa, so they tackled in low position. Therefore they could face opponents. At the end of the game , Japan team Got penalty. If Japan team was willing to draw, they just kicked the ball, but they aimed victory. Japan team never gave up fighting and at last they scored. This winning is due to all members including reserve members, staffs , and coach. I was surprised to hear that players who don't have nationality of Japan can fight with Japan team members . I understood that rugby has no border. There is famous saying, ""One for all, all for one"". It simply represents style of rugby. This kind of thought is important not only do sports but also other thing. Following this example of Japan team can make our society better."
NBE06295,"I agree with your opinion. It is often overlooked that Japan is multi-cultural society. It is because Japan is island country and therefore reluctant to accept other nation's people. Japan should change that kind of thought and accept many kind of people who are from foreign countries . That can bring Japan more benefit. The example of Japan rugby team is the key to advance Japanese multi-cultural society. Of course, Japanese people should go abroad more positively. When you are exposed to other culture, you can gain many benefits and can get wider vision."
NBE05818,"I am not a big fun of Rugby at all. But I am so glad that Japan played really good in 2015 Rugby World Cup. Since they played good enough to get attention by mass media and Japanese people, there will be awesome thing coming for the players. Now they are famous and are able to earn money than they used to be by appearing on television commercials and so on. I remember exactly same thing happened in 2011 when Japanese team won the first place in FIFA women's World Cup. Basically for those sports players who are not famous, it is so difficult to live only by playing sports. It is not rare to have the part-time job in the company. First, whoever gets the first place gets 1 million dollars as a prize by FIFA. And then there will be a lot of people who goes to see their domestic league game in Japan. So winning in the national game is so important. I hope that this Rugby-movement last longer and I wish of them keep playing really good for a long time."
NBE07420,"Your comment is so interesting. What you want to say is half people can play sports better than Japanese, but they have discriminated against by Japanese, so we must recognize them. I can understand your comment and I agree with you. However, I think this seems to be off the point. The reason why Brave Blossoms have foreign players is the rule of international. You commented that Japan accepted migration, cross-border and multiple identities. I think it is misunderstanding. It is certain of there are many players of other races. They have stronger love to Japan than ours."
NBE07196,"We should be proud of our Japanese rugby team for the win against South Africa. I thought that rugby is minor sports, but once they got a big won, it became worldwide news. This proved that sports is the one thing that clearly grabs our heart. We should encourage more activities also to cheer Japanese people and economy since it is proved. I hope sports will be one of the things that will prevent war in the future."
NBE05924,"Rugby World Cup (RWC) 2015 pool B, a game with Japan in South Africa were carried out in southern Brighton and raised large Venus which broke South Africa of the world ranking third place that Japan which there was not of the win boasted of championship of the past twice to in RWC for 24 years with 34 - 32. I accomplish the in history RWC's greatest upset, and Japan which made start that it is with the last eight to aim for, and there is no longer it invites the game with Scotland of the pool B second war on 23rd in a severe schedule called middle 3rd. On September 19, 2015, it is Brighton community stadium. The Eddie Jones representative from Japan head coach acted and declared it calmly while the lingering sound that approximately 30, 000 large audiences were fuddled with the in history RWC's greatest upset was left. ""The history just changed"""
NBE07129,"I watched this game too. Rugby is ability difference was a clear sport, and Japan won 1 by rugby World Cup so far, rugby had not been done. Because such team won against a team of a 3rd place of the world rank, I was quite moved. Japanese representative also kept making a leap attack after that, and I won 3 by this meet. I think that's a really wonderful thing. Japanese representative's players were saying that everyone changed history of Japanese rugby. And the players who accomplished that think it's wonderful. I'd like to follow them and make an effort, too. And I'm hoping to want them to play an active part for future Japanese rugby."
NBE05983,"When I heard this news on TV, I couldn't believe that the rugby team of Japan won South African team in the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England on Sept. 19. Nobody thought that Japan team won, before the game. However, rugby is eyed as exciting sports to all Japanese people now. Goromaru who is a member of Japan's team of rugby, have a routine. It is known as ""Goromaru Pose"". I do short track speed skating. But this sports is not known to people enough. Yui Sakai who is the player of short track, is the strongest player in Japan. So, I hope that she get gold medal in the Olympic Games, And then this sports is known more to many people."
NBE07314,"I can't believe that these worldwide famous companies caused serious troubles. Why couldn't they prevent the accidents? I think the recent problems hurt the companies' reputation and they lost customers' credit. In my opinion, regarding Volkswagen and BMW, they should develop a technology to make diesel engines which meet emission standards instead of using the test-cheating software. Environmental consideration is one of the most important concepts in the world now. So it may be one way for the companies' recoveries to make efforts to invent clean diesel engines. These accidents should never occur. I want those leading automakers to remain reliable!"
NBE07477,"I was disappointed to read that Volkswagon added software to its diesel engines to fool environmental agencies. I think that it is the worst thing to do such a thing on purpose in spite of understanding that it is an act in violation of rules. Everyone feel that they have been cheated by Volkswagon. So, if VW doesn't seem to have repented at all for what they did, VW will not able to recover from the scandals. I hope that the corporations in the car industry don't violate rules again."
NBE06255,"I was so shocked to hear that Volkswagen added software to its diesel engines to fool environmental agencies into thinking that the engines met emissions standards. It is unbelievable and must not be allowed that the automaker which has responsibility to keep safety for people commit such an injustice. I got scared to imagine that I might get involved in trouble. Can you imagine that all the people driving Beetle not living life in peace even though VW produce ""the Beetle""? I hope that automakers would not repeat to commit such an injustice by producing safety cars."
NBE07347,"I think Volkswagen will be able to recover from this scandal as Toyota and the General Motor have done the same. Although it was shocking news to people all over the world, there are still enthusiastic fans. Also, people forget those scandals as time goes by. However, it is certainly true that Volkswagen has to work hard on getting back trust by customers. It needs to improve its service and show them its safety. To do so, I wanted Martin Winterkorn to stay in his position. I also wonder why scandals of Toyota was considered more than General Motors and felt products of Japan is more trusted or expected by the world. It is sad to know by a bad news, but I hope Japanese workers can work for better products or services with proud."
NBE05608,"Certainly Volkswagen is to be blamed. Violating rules is forbidden. But there is a difficult point in the international trade. One nation has its own rule and the other nation has its own one too. In this point, making international rule is so difficult. People occasionally are bad and want to earn money. This news is typical one. I think Japanese standard is usually very strict. Therefore, many countries should accept Japanese standard."
NBE06225,"Though I don't have much knowledge about auto industry, I know Volkswagen is one of the biggest companies that produce cars. So this news was a great surprise even to me. Anyway, VW will surely lose its fortune and fame. And I think the latter is more important matter for VW, because confidence is generally more difficult to get and keep than money. But is emission standard itself that matter? I think reducing using cars is more effective than strict emission regulation. For example, the United States, as we know, is very highly motorized country where people (especially in countryside) have many cars and make use of them very often. If they use (or can use) public transportation instead of their own cars, or share the cars they use, the situation would get much better."
NBE06118,"I was very shocked this news because I use a car every day. The car carries a person, so it is important to be safe. I may die if broken when I run on the way. I do not have driving license. However a lot of my friends have driving license, so the car is very imminent. Volkswagen and Toyota are very big company, so they can hide an accident. However we want to know an accident. It is not the profit of the company and wants them to keep the security of people."
NBE07346,"I also think safety must be always the most important point to be considered. I understand that those huge companies could hide any accidents which suffer a loss, but I want them to reconsider the ideology of their companies. Nobody is there to produce unreliable cars. When there are lots of statistics, people face competition with their rival companies, but profits or winning the competition is less important. Every one knows that the top priority is safety. Even though the fact Volkswagen and other companies has done these things are shocking to us, I hope this will become a lesson for all the companies around the world."
NBE06496,"I was really shocked to know this news. Cars are essential in our life and I actually drive or ride almost every day. So, automakers should put the safety of them before everything else. It is natural for me to keep safe driving in mind at all times. I can drive the car because we believe that my own car is safe, of course. This misconduct just leads to harm the reputation of company one works for. Japanese companies' like Toyota strongest point is that they are safe. And, Volkswagen is popular among Japanese drivers and has a large number of fans. I hope these automakers would restore customer confidence. Also, Automakers are proceeding automatization of driving car now. There is no doubt that this is very useful and epoch making system. But, I am worried that whether the safety standards is adequate or not after hearing this news. I think it is necessary to inspect the safety rigidly."
NBE06495,"I was also shocked to know this news. Volkswagen is one of the most famous automakers in the world. Nevertheless, I can't believe that it added software to its diesel engines to fool environmental agencies into thinking that the engines met emissions standards. Certainly, it is very important that the automaker advance manufacturing environmentally friendly cars. There will be a growing demand for ecological cars due to an increase in environmental awareness. But, the drivers naturally trust their cars' safety. First of all, it has to think first of their safety. The automakers should exercise strict safety control and restore customer confidence. I hope that the automakers won't repeat such an injustice as this."
NBE06708,"Auto industry is the key of Japanese economy, it is really important. TOYOTA's recall, TAKATA's accident. . . . . . these are the big problems, but I hope they'll manage that. because Japanese makers have strong R&D and particular about quality. Japanese auto industry is consist of giant finished vehicles makers and immense subcontractors. Importantly, many people only say about finished makers like TOYOTA, NISSAN, HONDA. . . . . . etc, but, subcontractors like parts manufacturers are also important players. They hold the keys of quality of production. Germany auto makers was hit today, but they will be in the high position after this because they have strong industry consist of many powerful manufacturers like BOSCH, Continental and ZF. The most important thing is to share cutting edge technology in the auto industry. Making system to share that. Recent research in this industry cost amazingly, so one makers cannot do every research. It's tragic scandal. VW have and will have severe injury, but there is no need to be too worried about this. If VW downs, their resource will be used another Germany makers."
NBE06735,"I was surprised to hear this news. It was a shock that there was a bad thing to the product of a German car company said to be a luxury model in Japan. I hear news about the injustice more recently. In the Japanese car company, the cases such as defectiveness of the air back or the defectiveness of the engine are up several times. It may be natural that there is a defective article at the time cause to create by human. But it needs an effort and the faithfulness of the company to prevent an accident by a few checks. It is difficult to restore the trust that it lost once."
NBE05819,"I think what you are saying is really true. It is so hard to make one rule between two countries. And it is also true that there're people who just think about the money and ignore the rules. This kind of things happens all time around the world, even in Japan. So they should be punished heavily and get heavy penalty."
NBE05925,"I can't believe that these worldwide famous companies caused serious troubles. Why couldn't they prevent the accidents? I think the recent problems hurt the companies' reputation and they lost customers' credit. In my opinion, regarding Volkswagen and BMW, they should develop a technology to make diesel engines which meet emission standards instead of using the test-cheating software. Environmental consideration is one of the most important concepts in the world now"
NBE07012,"This isn't a singular thing that only VW is guilty of. All the manufacturers have been busted for something or other in the last 30 years, some emission relate, some safety related, some economy related. All manufactures are compelled to cheat to win severe sales competition. Therefore we have oblige of monitoring whether companies cheat or not. The responsibility of this problem is on not only manufactures but also us."

The responsibility of this problem is on not only manufactures but also us. """
NBE06045,"I think this problem is concerned with trust of the VW. These days CM of VW was broadcast frequently, so I was surprised and disappointed very much. This directly concerns with environmental problem such as global warming. The other day, Bill Gates said capitalism cannot save us from climate change. It is right this. Probably, for profit VW tampered with the data. In capitalism, large company tends to make more money. And other companies also might tamper with the data. We cannot but doubt it. To improve the environmental problem, companies must make an effort each and cooperate each other. I think these are important. Even if one company makes an effort, other company works injustice, the problem will not be solved."
NBE06044,"I think so, too. Even if it is a big company, it is difficult to restore the trust that it lost once. Companies must get rid of the mistake and injustice is the most unreasonable. Safety being lost is life-threatening. The problem of the exhaust gas affects an environmental problem. The car industry spreads around the world, so they may have a big influence. They should be in particular careful."
NBE05926,"Purification of the effluent gas such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and the discharge reduction of the CO2 have a relationship of the antinomy in a diesel car. I am considered to have controlled a CO2 discharge without starting a depurator using illegal software because CO2 discharges increase if I use the effluent gas depurator. It can take the hand illegally when I made much of , corporate strategy called the restraint of the CO2 discharge. However, the corporate strategy of VW will overturn from root and trunk if I did wrong until CO2 discharge data. This injustice became clear by in-house investigation of the company. When I measure effluent gas by the model certification of the vehicle according to the announcement, it is said that I did the operation that a CO2 discharge becomes less than the fact."
NBE05047,"I cannot believe that these worldwide famous companies caused serious troubles, too. When I went to Germany almost half of the cars made by Volkswagen. I want them to make a new clean diesel engines and take back the position and honor."
NBE06736,"The refugees issue is a world common problem. When Japan often is received criticism for Japan pays only money. However, I think that it is difficult to accept refugees in Japan, because it is still a body with the prejudice to a foreign worker. Prime Minister Abe stated that the activities by women and elderly people and economic growth are more important to Japan than the refugees issue. This way of thinking is not wrong, but he shouldn't have declared it for the world. It is natural to have to cooperate with the solution to world common problems as a diplomatic part. The Japanese should feel the refugees issue close a little more and it is necessary for the government to show posture to cooperate in the world."
NBE07258,"At first, I thought that this problem is very difficult and serious when I heard this news. But I think that Japanese government should not accept refugees. Because I have two reasons. First, there are a lot of problem and people who need a help. For example the welfare of the elderly person. Second, if Japanese government accept refugees, I think that this action will make the confused situation in Japan. After that it will make new problem in Japan, I think. By these reasons, I think that Japanese government should not accept refugees."
NBE06119,"I was very surprised when I was known this news because I don't know this news. Japanese government should spread Japanese news. The problem of refugees are very important, so Japanese people should think about this problem. The problem of the emigrant are serious problem now in Japan. Refugees are different from an emigrant. However it does not different that a foreigner comes over to Japan from foreign country. The problem of emigrant has various opinions, so Japanese government should think about refugees and Japanese people should know this news."
NBE07315,"I agree with the latter half of your opinion. Abe's argument sounds as if Japan lacks international cooperativeness. Even though other foreign countries declared to receive refugees, as for Japan, it sounds too selfish not to show the willingness to take in Syrian asylum seekers. Indeed, Abe's view itself that we have many things which we should do before accepting immigrants or refugees may be to the point. However, I think it is not appropriate for the answer to problem. It avoids the point. No one in the world would expect such an answer of Japan. Subsequently to the problems about STAP cell, the Olympic emblem and the stadium design, as this rate, Japan will lose its credit more severely in the world. On the other hand, I think Japan's financial assistant is enough contribution to refugee problem. Both financial support and receiving of refugees are essential. Furthermore, I can understand there are many problems with accepting of refugees. However, in terms of international cooperativeness, I think Japan should receive them little by little, and become one of the global players in resolving the problem."
NBE07130,I think Japan should accept a victim from Syria. Various problems may form by accepting a victim. But it's good that Japan is criticized by other advanced countries when only aid money is taken out to such international problem. I think so I should cooperate aggressively to such international big problem.
NBE06298,"I strongly agree with your opinion. Thinking of people who are in danger of terrorism is very important thing. It is true that accepting people from Syria and other middle Eastern countries is risky thing, we should know that most of them are victims and only a few are terrorist. Saving these people is not easy thing, but understanding that kind of situation is necessary. Trying to help those people is the first step to make world peace."
NBE06710,"I think Japan has to accept refugees. There are so many challenges to overcome, but we have to step forward due to strong growth of Japanese economy for the long future. Japan is closed country in fiscally and mentally. We can say it is strength of Japan like ""Japan has grown without interference"". Maybe it is true. But I think it will become failure in the future. We have to change fitting in this era that everything move globally. Any more, we shouldn't say the word of ""global"" because it's natural. Global is standard. Refugees will give us diversity, workforce, and growth. Of course, we need totally new solution to build high-level relationship with refugees. First, we need independent budget like fund for refugees. Only government cannot manage them by means of using only our tax for refugees. Creating a fund and financing variety of investors like corporate investor including sovereign wealth fund, the affluent population and so on. And we use this money for business mainly with refugees. Of course, in this proses, we have to invest a lot of money and time for education, welfare. Anyway, I mean, refugees don't have much credit capability, so the fund finances them and support their business. For example, connect them to the specialists, companies, overseas country and other fund. So, why we have to finance them taking lot of risks? Because refugees have double nationalities. They know and have network in their originate country. There is a business chance, isn't it? They will become key businesspersons. In this ""global"" era, there are fewer areas where aren't developed by advanced country. In almost developed countries, many countries and many companies are doing their business. So these countries generating refugees are kind of last frontiers. Accepting refugees is high reputation, high risk and high return. This is another war in global economy and politic."
NBE05820,"I have totally the opposite opinion about this matter, since Japan is now facing the problem called ""Aging Populations. "" I think accepting a immigrants is one of the good way to prevent that matter. There is few young people in Japan right now and there will be less and less in the future. So accepting a immigrants could make the situation better, they can be a workforce. There might be a troublesome things to do to accept them. But you need to think about what you can get and lose by accepting them."
NBE07197,"I agree that Japan accept refugees. Before that, we have to think about their future environment like. house, education and job. As we are worried to face population decrease and following short of the number of the people who are employed, Japan should willingly accept foreign people who are seeking place to live in. But it is as Japan take care of damage that The United States and other countries caused in Syria. I think someone must stop them from bombing innocent civilians who just wants to live with peace."
NBE06296,"Accepting many Syrian refugees is not easy thing. First of all, Japan is not next to other countries, so called island country. This means that Japan rarely were exposed to different culture. That made Japan unwilling to accept foreigners. Of course Japan pays a lot of assistant money to help these countries, but other countries want Japan come to the cite, and help these people directly. If Japan don't go to the cite in fact, it is little sense to pay aid money. Also Japan should accept immigrant in terms of humane way. This kind of act can bring Japan some benefits."
NBE06297,I somewhat disagree with your opinion. Aiding money itself is enough to help these people because Japan pays so much money.
NBE05953,"The refugee problem is a difficult issue all over world. Many developed countries face this problem. In Japan many people think that if Japan receive refugees they may commit a crime. And by the reason of that they disagree with the reception of refugees. However there are no evidences. Japanese prime minister Abe recommends the activities by women and elderly people and these activities will lead to economical growth in Japan. I think this way of thinking is OK. In addition to these, to receive the refuges also may be the good way to growth the economy. Why does prime minister Abe don't want to receive them? I think Japan should receive them positively."
NBE06046,"I don't agree with you. The refugee issue is serious and common around the world. The countries not separated by water are starting to accept the refugees. But it is bad to leave all them. Now we must cooperate between countries. Surely, if we accept many refugees, some confusion may happen in Japan. But bigger confusion must happen in their countries. When I think it, we cannot help helping them, I sure."
NBE07227,"To accept refugee is one of the biggest problems in this world now we live. Today's world have lots of refugees like political refugee, displaced refugee, economic refugee and so on. But World countries become severe when they are put under the situation they may have to accept refugee. There is many reasons they are unwilling to accept such people. First of all, there is almost no preparation to accept them socially. Every countries has poor people. If migrants lead a better life in front of them, they are likely to be vent of their pent-up feelings. Since this disturb public order, government avoid accepting. Secondary, the power of immigrant is uncountable. refugee is really hungry, , physically, materially, mentally. If such aggressive people entered a country, they may take place of the origin citizen. This is really horrible for people. So officials and people are wanting to avoid accepting such people. But accepting such people to some extent is good for economy, and it will also contribute to solve aging society. There is a good sides and bad sides to this problem. It seems that Shinzo Abe is facing a really difficult choice. But I think to manage to do with such difficulties is also a responsibility as a prime minister of Japan."
NBE06709,I agree with you because Japan has responsibility as a large country and every countries should take up this problem.
NBE05134,"I think the problem of refugees is very serious. Because of the civil war in Syria, more and more people have lost their places to live. Therefore they have no choice but leave their own country and go abroad to live safely. I guess most of us think that it is not related to Japanese people. However, the problem of refugees is also important for us, although Japan and Syria (this country is in Middle East and next to Turkey and Lebanon and so on) are not near in the term of distance. But globalization has continued for this some decades and supposed to be continued even from now on. Then we must think everything more globally. Thinking about the problem of refugees from Syria, in my opinion, it is almost impossible for Japanese government to accept them safely. There are some reason. First, it is said that it is difficult for them to live in Japan. Because in Japan, only Japanese is spoken. I think the refugees from Syria cannot speak Japanese. The difference of language is very serious when it comes to living abroad. I think it not easy for them to learn Japanese because their language and our one is very different. Next reason is that if we accept the refugees, without doubt Japanese order will be broken. I mean, I'm sure our country will lost current safety. Let me take an example of attack at Paris last year. It happened in 13th November. It was big surprise for all of us. Because this attack, a lot of people passed away. Some media says that those who did an act of terrorism is try to behave as if they were refugees when they entered inside of France. It is the reason why some people think that it is dangerous to other countries to accept the refugees from Syria. When it comes to terrorism, everyone has possibility to have involved in the accident even if how they are careful about their environment. As a matter of fact, the United States of America decided to stop accepting the refugees saying that it can be harmful to American peace. Believing any religion too fanatically can kill people- I thought so when considering the conflict between different religions. Most of refugees don't have will to kill someone or to cause terrorism, but some do. That's why it is very difficult to accept refuges."
NBE06371,"I think so too, refugees do not have a choice to leave their own country or stay there. However, it is fact that some developing countries still have not prepared for refugees to create an environment to live. If Japan accepts refugees, it might costs a small fortune although Japan has huge budget deficit. Nevertheless, I consider Japan should accept refugees as much as possible, and now is in time to take in refugees with Japanese hospitality"
NBE06825,"I think that the Thai government's security was failure. Recently, terrorists are increased, so the government should do something to defense country's peace."
NBE05609,"Terrorism is to be blamed, but I think that there are some problems in Thai government. First of all, Thai police investigated wrongly. As a result, the murderer has yet to be arrested. Second, Thai government lacks the intelligence power. I think that Japan also lacks it. So, both nations must improve their intelligence power. Third, there is racial problem in the background of the terrorism. Uighur people are oppressed by the government in China. Thai government has sent back the Uighur exile from China. Some Uighur people were upset or angry about this sending. This is one of the cause of the terrorism."
NBE05178,"Thai police had made a wrong decision at first. I think that the mistake brought about the murder. There are other people who connect with the attack, so I'm concerned about their existence. Also, I understood that the problem of radical Islamism is so serious worldwide, because according to this article, many of the suspects named by Thai police have Muslim sounding names. After all, this incident also was politically motivated, so I recognized that political or economic problem could change humans' minds, but the very groups such as the governments, which caused these problems, didn't notice it. In addition, I think that the idea that Buddhists won't become terrorists is unrealistic, so government should change its lax system and strengthen the system of anti-terrorism."
NBE05313,"When I read this article, I was surprised at Thai. Thai police and prosecutors are lax so that it is rapidly change the way of suspecting. There are too many unclear points about the accident. I think Thai police have to arrest people after careful inspection. They should not believe Buddhists too much and have to consider all pattern of fact. If there are many countries such like Thai, it is possible to happen terrible accidents like this time and dangerous for people. Police have to be a strict system in the country."
NBE07348,"It is always sad to hear any news about terrorism. Even though I have never felt sympathy for terrorists, I agree that this terrorism shows the failure of Thai's government work as written in this article. Some people are not satisfied with their government and they express themselves by attacking. However, they have no rights to kill other people and I think it will not lead to solve any problems. And I wonder why the arrested people did not talk why they did it. I think even in the jail, it is a great chance to insist their opinions. It will be reported like this and more people will know what they were complaining of. Obviously, they should find another way to do it, but I just do not understand why they are acting like that."
NBE05270,"I was surprised at this news story. 2015 November 12, terrorist attacks happened in Paris. This terrorism was shocked to the whole world. I think everyone know this terrorism. Because, this terrorism have been broadcast almost everyday. So I know this news. But I didn't know Thai terrorism. I didn't watch news of this terrorism. Many terrorism happen in the world. But, all terrorism is not broadcast. After Paris terrorism, many people hoped peace of Paris using #wishforparis on SNS. It is good thing, I think. But I have s sense of incongruity. Terrorism happen in Syria or Israel. But terrorism in Syria and Israel are not broadcast, and people don't hope peace as Paris one. It is strange and unfair. We should know that terrorism happen all over the world and we should know terrorism. I thought Thai is safe. But I knew terrorism will happen everywhere from this news. Every time terrorism happen, I think that why terrorist attacks to ordinary people. Most of terrorist disagree or dissatisfied with the government. Attacking is bad. But I think they should protest to the government, not attacking ordinary people. So the government should listen their opinion."
NBE05453,"When I read this article I was shocked at Thai's police. DNA matching is not exact. I want the police to examine the evidences again. Terror can be allowed to occur should not be. It has two meanings. One is that terror generates a lot of damages. Many would be killed and broken. Second is the success of terror promote next terror. It is very fearful. It may not make us cut a series of evil. I think police of the world is put down one by one terrorism, and it is necessary to think that it is useless to cause a terrorist to terrorist."
NBE07131,I think terrorism is very dangerous and is the act which isn't permitted. Terrorism has also happened at Europe as well as the Middle East and Asia recently. So I'm wishing that a real criminal of this event can be arrested early.
NBE06737,It is wrong to perform terrorism even if there was faith. Terrorism at the sightseeing spot increases recently. Each country must do counterterrorism. The reinforcement of the guard is very important.
NBE07099,I can understand what you are trying to say but I don't agree with you for this point. It is almost impossible for government to stop all the terrorism. Thailand is known for beautiful shrines so government cannot put too many securities around the shrines which will damage the traditional scenery.
NBE06192,"Bangkok Erawan Shrine bomb is one of the most terrible terrorisms this year. When I watched TV, I knew this incident as a news flash. At that time, I was surprised very much and I think we shouldn't allow terrorism absolutely. I hope that it comes a day when there aren't terrorism all over the world."
NBE06372,"In recent years, there are many terrorist incidents in the world. It might be under the influence of IS. Those terrorist incidents are so inhumane actions, and so many innocent people are driven to die by them. I also hope world peace. However, it difficult to stop attacking by terrorists, because we cannot know when and where they will appear. I am afraid of that terrorism occurs in Japan, because IS is arousing the Japanese government. Two Japanese journalists have already killed in last year, so terrorism is not somebody else's problem."
NBE05984,"I disagree with your opinion. It is more serious than you think. It is exactly right that the government should do something to defense country's peace. But it is not enough, the government only do. Country's peace have to be considered and defended by all citizens of the country. It is the most important thing, all people have a consciousness of defense own lives. In recent years, IS is making influence stronger in the world. In last year, they caused a serious incident in Paris. Many people died in this incident. Terrorism should be forgiven. We should produce an act to wipe out terrorism."
NBE06019,It is important to save life of people. So big and strong country which include Japan have to work together!
NBE06826,"There are many problems between America and Russian. But, I think that the purpose of them that eradication terrorism is same, so helping each other is needed to solve the problem."
NBE06426,"This problem is very difficult. Why? Because, all nation have each thinking for themselves. I think that if this thinking didn't disappear dream wouldn't come true. However, this problem must be solved, so I expect all presidents."
NBE05610,"Syrian problem is so difficult to solve. There is an antagonism between America and Russia in the background. America and EU have been supporting Free Syria Arab Army which is hostile to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad. On the other hand, Russia has been supporting Assad. Because of the lack of administrative authority, Islamic State appeared. They oppose to both Free Syrian Arab Army and Assad. They have destroyed a lot of remains of ancient Syria and killed a lot of innocent people. For a long civil war, many people in Syria have gone out of Syria and became refugees. Now EU is upset about refugee problem. EU welcomed ""Arab Spring"" in 2011. This refugee problem is due to ""Arab Spring"". EU and America are responsible for the refugee problem. But I don't try to support Russia which supports Assad. As Japan, Russia is unworthy of trusting. For example, Russia brought about Crimean problem. So I negatively support America and EU. I think that only supporting America and EU and overthrowing Assad and IS brings Syrian happiness. There is no other choice. Supporting Russia means death of America as a world's policeman."
NBE05135,"A civil war in Syria has become one of the most serious problems in the world. Its cause is about religion. For Japanese, the problem about religion is unfamiliar because a few of us believes it so deeply. However, it is very important fact all over the world especially in the Middle East where a lot of people are Muslim. In Syria, over 110, 000 people are killed over the war because of the battle between the Assad government and its national people. Moreover, the joining of big two countries made this war more complicated. They are America and Russia. Then, now the civil war in Syria is regarded as not only the problem of Syria but also the problem of the world. Therefore we all have to think about this problem deeply and seriously. In my opinion, America and Russia must stop their selfish way of diplomacy toward the Middle East. Although I know that it is difficult to solve, everyone in this planet should try to settle it. What I would like to emphasis is that America and Russia have the responsibility of a series of events, and Syria is not their plaything. A lot of people became refugees and they have no choice to running away to European countries. In EU countries, they are also in trouble because there is not enough space to live all the refugees. Also there is not enough jobs for them. As a matter of fact, so many people are suffering from this civil war. So it must not be unsolved. Even for Japanese young people, like us, it is not unrelated events although the Middle East is so far away from our country as a point of view of distance."
NBE07385,"I agree with your opinion especially in terms of the relationship between this conflict and our country, Japan, because Japan has friendly relations with US Japan also has hostile relation with China, Korea and Russia in terms of its territory, so if this conflict developed war, Japan perhaps would be fight not Syria but these powerful countries in addition. We must face this problem more carefully."
NBE06738,"Syrian problem is important and difficult to solve. Refugee problem must be achieved to resolve in the world. Japan is also not in other people's affairs. Do not abandon the people that life has become severely by IS. However, it is natural countries refused the entry of refugees cause to fear that the security. It is wonder that it realize the world that all mankind will live a life safely in peace. The world has a lot of problems that countries cooperate to protect the lives of people."
NBE07132,"I think Syrian refugee's problem by a civil war and problem of Islamic nation are a very difficult problem. United States of America and Russia are going to settle this problem by an aerial bombardment, but I think then a new war is just caused. But I think it isn't also tied with a solution of this problem to aid with funds like Japan. I think it's good to accept a victim like Germany and settle this problem peacefully."
NBE06071,"I agree with you. religious issue is the most difficult problem. Because, there is not only one answer, and people who believes must not doubt what they believe."
NBE07170,"I think the problem choosing girlfriend or mother doesn't have the answer. People's lives are equal, so we can not decide it. China's Ministry of Justice said to save parents over other relatives and loved ones was the correct option. I think its reason was lack of persuasiveness. However, if we fall into such an situation, we should choose anyone. The best way is saving all of them, so we have to think this way every time."
NBE06986,"When I read this article for the first time, I was very surprised. This question is too ridiculous because we must have a complete grasp of the surrounding situation when we face such a situation. In my opinion, I choice the person who can't escape on his own. So I think it shouldn't appear in the exam because it is difficult to give the correct answer or solution to the problem. What is more, I can't understand why the person who doesn't help mother amounts to a criminal failure to act. As someone says in the article, people's lives are equal, and they should be treated equally by the law. I also can't understand why no-one on the Chinese Internet appears to address the sexist nature of the question. I feel women's status in China maybe weak. This is a pity, so I want China to change such a world little by little."
NBE06985,I agree with your opinions which the reason of China's Ministry of Justice is lack of persuasiveness. I can't understand people are legally obligated to save their parents over other relatives and loved ones in China. Our choice should depend on not blood relationship but the situation in which we are placed. So I think it is unusual that country is concerned with self-decision in that situation.
NBE07318,"The question means ""rank the values of people's lives"". I think the way of thinking itself is fundamentally wrong. The question was made on the assumption that people's lives are not equal. Regardless of whether he is only morally responsible or he has a duty to support, the two lives are equal and can't be compared in terms of the degree of importance. If I were a one of the examinee, I might choose my mother too because of a feeling of gratitude for her raising me. However, I don't think it is a correct answer. To begin with, the question doesn't make sense. So in my opinion, it is not appropriate for the official judicial examination."
NBE07480,"I was very surprised to read that the question, ""Whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire"", appeared in the National Judicial Exam. And I was also astonished to read that a son is legally to save his parents over other relatives and loved ones. I think the question is ridiculous. There are two reasons. First, all people must be treated equally, so we should not think which person we should help on priorities first. Second, if we are such a situation as a matter of fact, we will be easily upset, and we will not be able to tell which is better. Therefore, it is no use to think about this question."
NBE05247,"I considered about whom I will choose in such situation, but I couldn't make up my mind. I agree with the person's idea who think that people's lives are equal, so they should be treated equally by the law. I can't understand why the choice of girlfriend will be a crime and the choice of mother is correct. It is not ethical. The people who make the National Judicial Exam should think about this question again."
NBE05246,"I agree with you. The question does not have the answer. Although the Ministry of Justice said that saving parents over other people was the right answer, other people also have the life, so there is no reason to give up them. This question shouldn't have been on the exam."
NBE06769,"I was so surprised and couldn't believe when I read this article for the first time. I think the question like ""whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire"" in a compulsory test is ridiculous, because people's lives should be treated equally. However, there is a sentence like ""I would definitely save my mother first. Apart from legal reasons, my mother raised me. Plus my girlfriend is younger, which means she has a better chance of escaping the fire on her own"". I think there is some truth in what one man said. When looking for the effective breakthrough, it might be the best way to help both mother and girlfriend. But I cannot understand the reason why a question setting person sets the question like that. Hundreds of thousands of trainee lawyers and judges in China don't need it."
NBE05786,"I think the ideal for this situation is leaving one's own thought, not decided by the law. However, we cannot act freely without the regulation by the law. In this case, we cannot criticized by the law if we save mother while dismiss a girlfriend. Of course, The people who related to a girlfriend in this situation will criticize to us. It's hard for us to choose which is justice, observing the law honesty or handling with our opinion and situation. By the way, in the first place, I doubt the thought that question is suitable for the national exam. Certainly, It's justice because this sentence is exist as the law. I think this theory is good, but they should've think it thoroughly in the process of making the questions. Also, to begin with, this question express the posture of China that they only think about man, I think they are still childish by the view of a one of the Japanese people."
NBE05179,"Before mentioning the subject, I'm concern about that multiple choice test can decide who is proper to be a legal professor. Also, the subject whether saving girlfriend instead of mother is a crime isn't the problem which is decided with such choices. I think that the question can be changed by time and each person has each own answer. Nobody don't have authority to settle the so difficult question, I feel because according to some famous persons such as Jefferson, Lincoln, and Martin Luther King Jr. , all people are equal. I now maybe save my father because my parents are the most precious persons for me. If the question are answered by not only trainee lawyers in China, but also people all over the world, regardless of sex, it become more important opportunity that everyone deeply think about human's value and sexual problems, which people cannot have solved."
NBE05409,"When I first read this article, I was very confused and I couldn't make up my mind for the National Judicial Exam's Question. This question is that whether saving girlfriend instead of mother is a crime or not. In this case, he saved his girlfriend from a burning building over his mother, so his action amounted to a criminal failure. To be sure, we only have one mother and father, so parents are precious for us. So if I come across these helpless situation, I probably help my parents. However, girlfriend or boyfriend is also precious figure for us. In addition, people's lives are equal, so we should treat them equally. From these reasons, I think this question doesn't have a correct answer. So I think this is a ridiculous question. We should take good care of our parents and also treat friendship as an important matter. If we would fall with these helpless situation, we ought to make a good choice appropriately for the each occasion with the sense of ourselves. This is a debatable problem because we can think it from various point of views such as law and sexism. I also thought there are some difficult problem which we can't answer clearly and briefly."
NBE06226,"Who would decide what life is more important than another? Nobody can rank people's lives, as we all know. I was so surprised to see the question asking such a thing that I could hardly believe it was from the National Judicial Exam. It is definitely ridiculous situation where a question like that has a certain answer officially, I think (as a Japanese) . But I must say China has traditional Confucian values, which has a doctrine ranking seniority above the youth. I think this cultural background is worth considering , when we discuss the problem. You cannot deny the fact that cultural (or historical) context differs from country to country, and that makes their own law systems effectively work. So , after all, what is needed now is Chinese's interest in the problem and their deliberation over it. Only Chinese could fundamentally settle the question that China faces."
NBE06742,"I was surprised at this news. This question has serious problem. Ethical issues should be treated with caution. That they rescue girlfriend or mother shouldn't make to correct. Such as this question, I think we should not compare the human life. Creatures of life is something important equally."
NBE06859,"It is very difficult question that ""Whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire"". It ask that ""what value do you put on?"" In the world, generally, it is said Europeans and North americans put value on his girlfriend, but Asian put it on his mother. It comes from difference of culture. European and North Americans think ""my mother enjoyed her life enough and now it is my turn so I have to get happiness with my girlfriend"". The other hand, Asian accepted influence of Confucianism tightly and it teaches ""Be good for older"" so Asian may think ""why I leave my mother?"". However, thought difference of difference, it is same heart that we don't want to meet these situation I think."
NBE06591,"I was surprised at this news. The bar examination is a national examination. You must not make questions for the problem that you cannot judge the right or wrong in a national examination. Since China has a large population, it is unavoidable to make questions for a tough questions. However, it is unfair to make questions for a vague question. Since it is the examination that the results are decided on with one, there must not be such a situation. I think that they should increase the number of people who make questions for the bar examination , thereby they can make questions carefully."
NBE05546,"I think that considering about multiple choice options is important for the people wanting to enter the judiciary or legal profession because the situation they have to judge can happen. If the situation happened and they didn't think about that, they couldn't cope with that correctly. So, I agree to the opinion of state media that the test is most exacting. For sure, the test is good for the people wanting to enter the judiciary or legal profession. But, I don't want to imagine that situation like choosing to save my mother or my girlfriend. I imagine that situation, but I can't make an answer. The best thing is that it won't happen. I only pray that it won't happen."
NBE07066,"I was surprised at this news because I didn't think that such situation is defined by the law. this question is ridiculous. This should not be defined by a law. It's an ethical problem. A person will became desperate only for saving a life in such situation. At first we should praise the fact he saved human life even if he saved whichever of mother or girlfriend. If I face the situation, it is very difficult choice. I think that I will help my mother. However, actually, I don't know what I would do unless I really face the scene. Reading this news, I came to think that I should be filial to my parents."
NBE06258,"I disagree that the Ministry of Justice said the correct answer is a son is legally obligated to save his parents over other relatives and loved ones. To begin with, I don't agree that the lives of parents are more valuable than the lives of girlfriend only because of blood relative. I strongly believe that we should treat the lives equally. In addition, it is strange that this question has a correct answer. Also, it is stranger that the question is presented as a national examination. Finally, we should not depend on one idea. If the national exam ask me an answer, I would answer that there are plural answers about this question depending on various factors such as closeness, love and situation. All in all, I strongly believe that we should make decision according to the situation."
NBE05611,"This is a difficult problem. Whether law should contain ethics or not is controversial. Certainly, ethics are important, but law should not necessarily be influenced by them. Law should be a pure rule. If law completely contained ethical points, it would not be a rule. I think law paradigm should not contain ethical elements completely. However, law is made by people, it would be influenced by ethics to some degree. In this incident, National Judicial Exam has a lot of problems. First of all, there is an ethical problem that I used to refer to. Second, this exam is sexily unfair. Third, China is usually irresponsible and cannot be relied on, so the exam would be groundless. Therefore, to look at this news from a lot of points of view, National Judicial Exam has a lot of problems."
NBE06427,"I think that the people who make this question do not have the heart which man has. I do not know his feeling, and I do not want to know it, too. I study subjects of Judicial Exam because I guess that I want to be the prosecutor. I have the purpose of being the prosecutor. Two years ago, my grandfather is dead. The people who break the law of traffic run over my grandfather . I can't forgive him. I guess that I want to judge bad mans. Because of this incident, my thought for Judicial Exam is very strong. And, I think that people who have this thought are not a few people. If each people had different thoughts, people who study subjects of Judicial Exam would have very strong thoughts. However, this question makes fun of people who have it. Everyone can't compared their mother with their girlfriend. I think that my mother and my girlfriend are very very important people for me. I want to rescue both of them. this problem is not a judicial problem and is the different problem. I hope that the people who make this question want to make judicial exam with the heart which man have."
NBE07422,"The question whether they save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire is discrimination for girls. This means China is not interested in care about discrimination of sex. I think that this must be corrected. For example, if I were in the same circumstance, I could not choose."
NBE05104,"When I read this article, I was very confused. The story that a man who chose to save his girlfriend from a burning building over his mother is a criminal is so difficult for me to consider. If i were in such situation, I cannot chose one of them. As the article says, I also think that people's lives are equal, so they should be treated equally b law. And, there is a problem in the question. The problem is that the test clearly assumes the test takers are male. I think the test should be reformed for both men and women."
NBE05103,"I think so, too. The problem choosing girlfriend or mother doesn't have the answer. When I fall into such a situation, I cannot choose one of them. I also think the best way is to save all of them. I want to consider the topic more deeply."
NBE05051,"When I read this article, I really interested in the relationship between the society and the sexism. The question focuses on the emergency situation for male, not female. First, I think it is natural because most examination candidates in this exam are male, probably. However, if I was an examination candidate, I would confused when I encounter this question. I am not familiar with law so I don't know the right answer for the question but no one cannot find it, I think. The right choice changes depending on the background of the family, couple, and the condition of their health. By the way, thinking about this problem is so interesting. I felt that compare the one answer to the other answer is meaningful. Last class I heard some opinions about this question, everyone has different thinking. I didn't achieve the right one answer, want to continue to thinking. In addition to my opinion, I didn't know that the system of becoming a lawyer is really different from the country. In Japan, the bar exams yield the least number of successful candidates worldwide. The old format of the examinations, last held in 2010 saw only 6% passing the exam."
NBE05273,"I was surprised the contents of the National Judicial Exam in China. This question which whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire is difficult for students. I wonder this question has right answer? The thinking which each peoples have are different. If I were a student who takes this test, I will answer this way. 'I will save my father. Because, my father is only one and he are older than my boyfriend. My boyfriend has more physical strength than my father. So I think there is a possibility of my boyfriend living. 'This is my thought. According to this article, some people think 'Girls are everywhere, but I only have one mum. ' And some people think 'People's lives are equal, they should be treated equally by the law. ' I think so too. I can't decide one answer. But, I think this question is very interesting. I want everyone to answer it. Some days ago, my friend told me a funny story. She has a boyfriend. She asked him 'which will you save me or your mother from a deadly fire?' And he answered ' My mother. ' She was shocked this answer. I thought it is poor thing when I heard this story. People's lives are very important. This question was too difficult for me to answer."
NBE05136,"I think the raw system in China is sometimes unreasonable. For example, only a child policy is very exorbitant. Whether we have a child or not and how many children we would have must be depend on us. However, Chinese government decided and direct its people. In this article, the question is really unreasonable. They asked us whether we help our mother or our girlfriend. Who can make up our minds? It is the kind of question that we cannot answer. Therefore it is ridiculous to ask such a question. I think there are a lot of other question which must be asked. Nobody can answer this question because both mother and girlfriend are important and every human lives have to be treated equally."
NBE07014,"I saw this news and thought China reminds Confucian view. ""Whether people should save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire"" Chinese think that they should save their mother because children must service for their parents in terms of Confucianism. But logically thinking, girlfriend and mother are equal. Chinese thinking is old, therefore this must be changed in order to up-to-date."
NBE07200,"Simply, if it were me, I choose my girlfriend. If saying the justice, they should save both, that is a hero, but mostly people can't afford it. As Chinese law says, mother and father are who raised us from our birth to this world. There are no doubt some parents who would long us to help them first, but taking future into consideration, we should first save our lover first. This problem doesn't only exist in China, but also all over the world. What should be most asked is not their choice of saving which life, but it is their courage. In a quite dangerous situation, whether they can think of someone's life first is significant."
NBE05752,"I was surprised at the question. I think that the worth of all life is equal. So, that helping his girlfriend is crime is unequal. Besides, the expression of girlfriend or mother means that the hosts of The National Judicial Exam suppose that the examinees are male. I think this is female discrimination."
NBE07263,"I thought that this question whether they save their mother or girl friend from death is terrible and sad, because it means to judge which value of the life is better. It is unbelievable question, I think. We should have recognition that all the life are equal all over the world."
NBE06678,"It's difficult problem whether you should choose your mother or girlfriend. On the one hand your mother is the only one. You were born by your mother. And you were brought up with your mother when you were a child and young. Whenever you feel sad, lonely or sore, your mother supported you certainly. On the other hand of course your girlfriend is important for you. Your girlfriend is your partner. If you marry your girlfriend, you will spend a lot of time with your girlfriend. So generally you can't choose whether your mother or girlfriend. I think this problem does not have an answer."
NBE07450,"I think Chinese people usually help their father or mother' because of Confucianism, and I expect that students who took law tests are tried whether they had esteem to their parents or not. Added to this , in those days Chinese people have the general idea that are the same as European people , so some of those people who are tested may choose to help their girlfriend , I think. And , a strange point of this test is what do people who made this law tests need to answer . At the same time, I thought this problem is not relevant to laws. I could not understand the intention of this problem."
NBE07448,"I agree with your idea. The problem , which person should help , contains ethics. I studied the difference between laws and ethics in jurisprudence. In fact, ethics are contained with how to think that has diversity. So ethics changes according to people , that is, every one has their original opinions. On the other hand, laws are the rules that are minimum. The laws are the minimum rules, so that people who break laws can be punished. For the ideas stated above, this tests contained ethics and laws , and laws and ethics should not be mixed"
NBE06257,"I agree with your opinion. Needless to say, human lives are equal. So, I strongly believe that the correct answer by National Judicial Exam of China is not correct. Therefore, they should reconsider this question ethically."
NBE06259,"I don't agree with your idea, but the way of your thinking is quite interesting to me. There are a lot of ways of thinking whom to be saved. Thus, the National Judicial Exam of China should not seek only one answer. Additionally, this exam should attach greater importance to the process of thinking rather than to seek only one answer."
NBE05520,"It's difficult problem whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire. I can't answer easily. First of all, I think this question is discrimination. If girls answer this question, it will have to use boyfriend instead of girlfriend in this question. So, this question shouldn't be on the exam. If I answer it, I will give ""I save mother"" as an answer. This is because my mother raised me, often listens to my problems, takes care of me when I have a cold , teaches thing to survive like the way of making dinner, laundry and using money. I need to repay an obligation for my mother. so, I help my mother."
NBE07351,"I think there is no right answer for the question. Thus, I do not understand why National Judicial Exam can decide whether people who chose their girlfriend is wrong. I would argue against if I were the one who answered girlfriend. It is because I think it means my thoughts are denied by an authority without justice. On the other hand, this article says it is interesting that nobody points out the sexual nature of the question as it assumes only male test takers. However, I do not think it is such a big issue. Men are usually considered stronger than women. It is not that stressful or difficult for women to think about this situation on the assumption that I were a man."
NBE07387,"I was so surprised to hear this news in many points. First, it is inappropriate to make questions for a legal examination. this is a too ethical question, so I think more legal questions should have been on the exam. Second, it is a bad question in terms of its ethical and sexual lukewarmness. Our lives should be treated equally and questions of this test should not be made for man. When I read this news, I do not think it is rude so much. If I was a girl, however, I thought there is a feeling of wrongness in the question."
NBE06342,"Firstly, I think that I can not understand the people who came up with the question. Think normally, this question does not have an answer. At the same time, people who aim to lawyers must choose. To sum up, they are forced to ultimate choice to choose either like this question. I aim at the lawyer, too. If I become a lawyer, not only lawyer but also people who became the legal profession, not uncommonly they are pressed for ultimate choice. Therefore, as I stated it first that I can not understand this question! But now, I think whether this question expresses the essence of the occupation called the judicial officer."
NBE05575,"I am surprised to hear hundreds of thousands of trainee lawyers and judges in China have been asked in a compulsory test. I am of the opinion that this question does not have absolute solution. I guess that both girlfriend and mother are special for us, and we do not have alternatives. This is why this question does not have the right solution. However, we have to understand Chinese culture. In China its philosophy or thought is called thought of ""Ju-ka""(thought of Confucius). In the thought of Confucius, they have to cherish our parents, because they have a debt of gratitude to grow up. Based on this thought, China makes up history. This is why we do not need to decide whether we would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire. However, we have to understand their culture of to think a great deal of their father and mother."
NBE05905,"I think that this question is unsuitable for two reason. First, the answer doesn't have correct answer. Test takers spend in different home environment, so the way of thinking is different too. Second, law should be a logic that convince all people. Law forces all citizens to obey, so it mustn't contain individual morals. I think it is good that the question sparked on the Internet. Now is the time to discuss this problem."
NBE06559,"I can not believe that such a question appeared in the National Judicial Exam. I think no one could say which is correct. If I am asked this question, I will not be able to answer. Our lives are equal, so we should not compare the worth of lives. And however there were female, this question assumed that examinees are male. I think this question is not appropriate for the National Judicial Exam."
NBE07386,"I agree with your opinion partly. This situation may come true someday and we must select which life we should save, so it is a good idea to think about it. However, I think the question is too inappropriate to be on this important exam in terms of its sexism and immorality."
NBE07388,"Oh my god! In the second line, I wrote ""this"", but I should write ""This"" because it is the first ward of that sentence. Sorry."
NBE05719,"The problem is difficult and I think the problem is nonsense, because this situation cannot be occurred. Confucianism in China may answer that should be helped mother. But both girlfriends and mother are special for us and these situations are not thought various family environmental, for example be abused. . . Some of those people may choose to help their girlfriend but I think this answer is not mistake. I think this question should not set a student for the National Judicial Exam"
NBE06155,"This is difficult problem whether we should choose our mother or girlfriend. On the one hand, our mother is the only one. We were born by our mother. And, we were brought up with our mother when we were a child. Whenever we feel sad, lonely or sore, our mother supported us certainly. Mother is an essential person for her child. On the other hand, of course our girlfriend is important for us. Whenever we feel sad, lonely or sore, our girlfriend supports us certainly, too. If we marry our girlfriend, we will spend more time with our girlfriend than our mother. So girlfriend is an essential for her partner. From the reason above, we can't choose whether our mother or girlfriend. I think this problem does not have an unapparent answer."
NBE05408,"I agree with your idea. A few days ago, China decided to abolish the system of a one-child policy. These days, the economic situation in China is declining, so I think China ought to reconsider their own nation systems. In addition, I also think it is impossible to answer this ridiculous question whether you help your mother or your girlfriend . We human lives should be treated equal."
NBE06154,"I feel a very strong anger on this issue. First of all, I think problems that correct answer is entrusted largely to the values of the individual should not be appeared in the National Judicial Exam. Then, I think it's also problem for China that the law which it is necessary to judge which her and mother is better is not yet abolished. The legislator in China should do away with the outdated laws. I can not make out why they don't do it yet. I hope law students who had worked on this problem will solve this issue very much."
NBE07479,"I agree with your idea. If I were in such a situation, I could not choose whether I would save my mother or boyfriend. And I also think that the best way is to help both of them. Of course people's lives should be treated equally. So this question that demands that they decide to help only one is inappropriate, I think."
NBE05545,"I never think of that idea. For sure, our parents is the ones who have raised us, and we should appreciate them. That is hard true. But, our girlfriends is also important person who may be a partner in the future. So, when we think of future, the choice we save our girlfriends may be better."
NBE05663,"I read this article, then I feel so bad. Because I do not like China. I guessed that it is China issue again. However, I feel that the most bad thing is equal rights for men and women. Naturally, low students told that saving girlfriend instead of mother is very bad issue. But, in the first place, why they chose girl friend? Why is it not boyfriend? It is assumption that it is object of man, not woman. At this time it is not equal rights of men and women. About the other, which people did you chose girlfriend or mother? They said, it is that all people are equal. But I think we are always partial in the world. It is properly. I help an acquaintance whether we help acquaintance whichever with a person not to know at all. Will there be the person who is not so? I think that no people who think help not know people. People always discriminate. So, they persecute or despise other people. It is not only Chinese issue, but Japanese issue. Of course I discriminate against such me. This is because it thinks that I make a great difference whether it is not a family or a family."
NBE06500,"I was surprised that this question appeared in the National Judicial Exam. I think the question doesn't have the correct answer. As equality is guaranteed by the Constitution of Japan, every life is equally important, of course. If I am asked the question in the test, I cannot choose whether saving our girl friend or mother from a deadly fire. I don't know system of Chinese law in detail. But, the lawyer needs some knowledge of seeing an issue from various perspectives and thinking equally. This is perfectly reasonable for lawyers in every country. So, it is unsuitable for entering the judiciary and legal profession must pass."
NBE05272,"I agree with your opinion. I learned that ""all people are equal"" in my class. We are all equal, so we cannot decide which live is important or precious. I was surprised this question. If I was the person who take a test, I could not answer this. Does this question has right answer? It is very difficult."
NBE07013,"I agree with you. the National Judicial Exam's Question is the question"" whether saving girlfriend instead of mother is a crime or not"". His action of saving girlfriend is amounted to a criminal failure because Confucianism is the religion that children must serve their parents more than other people. However this custom is too bad and too old nowadays because now all people is equal to all people. Therefore the answer of the question""Whether people should save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire"" should depend on personal value."
NBE07260,"I agree with your opinion and I think so too. I think it is impossible to judge which value of the life is better, and human beings are correctly equally. So we should share the thinking not to discriminate the human beings by sex all over the world!"
NBE05384,"If I must choose my mother or someone essential for me in emergency, I think the choice is up to the situation. However, to tell the truth, I cannot decide to chose one and leave the other, so I cannot understand the judgment that saving a girlfriend, not mother is a crime. I think that all lives should be treated equally without taking it consider that mother is family and that girlfriend is not. In Japan, this point that a person in emergency decides who he or she should save rarely become a big problem. So what people regard as important is depends on the national characteristics. It seems that people in foreign countries tend to spend much time with their family while Japanese people spend not so much. I think Japanese are too busy for their work or disinterested in their family. Now this is also a serious problem."
NBE05180,"I agree with your opinion. The question about choosing girlfriend or mother in the case of fire is so difficult, and nobody can find its answer, I thought. Also, in the same as your opinion, everyone on the earth cannot decide the value of others, I think. In addition, I felt the fact that the exam of public asks the question to examinees is specifically wrong. However, in fact, I might be forced to save someone instead of others someday, so I think that I continue to be troubled throughout all my life."
NBE06526,"I think this exam is illegal for two points. First, human should be treated equally regardless of sex, position and one's religion. Approving to rescue the mother from burning building instead of the girlfriend means admitting discriminating persons with their attributes by the law. Of course, I may rescue my mother in the same situation because I spend time longer with her than my girlfriend. However it is the story in emergency and I think he should not be blamed even if he chose rescuing the girlfriend. What is the problem is the law admitting distinguishing. In Japan there was a law about killing one's ancestor, but it is thought illegal for now because telling murdering ancestors from others is against Japanese constitution. I believe improving Chinese way of thinking about human rights as Japan. Second, anyone should sit the exam to be a legal occupation freely. Such as the first point, human must be treated equally. Of course, discriminating men between women is illegal. A person who prepared this question may assume male students. I think that if the person considered female students as well as men, he can't make such a question. What is suspected as a cause of this way of thinking is a low percentage of female legal occupation. I want women take the exam more regardless of opposing wind. By the way, I don't have girlfriend for now. Therefore I think this question is an incentive one, too."
NBE06343,"I think so, too. Mother is our only one for everyone. Because she always support us when we feel sad, lonely and happy. She shear our feel at any moment. On the other hand, girlfriend is our only one, too. A girlfriend is a person that you love each other. And you find treasure. So this question is too difficult to answer."
NBE07134,"When I read this article, I was very surprised. This problem is very difficult. I think this problem has no answer. Because human life is equal. The person who wants to protect mother should protect mother, the person who wants to protect girlfriend should protect girlfriend, The person who is not which should protect the person who was in the place. Now, I don't have girlfriend so my answer is protect my mother. But if I get girlfriend, I may cannot answer this problem."
NBE06400,"I think this tests have two problems. One is that human should be treated equally regardless of sex, position and one's religion. Approving to rescue the mother from burning building instead of the girlfriend means admitting discriminating persons with their attributes by the law. Of course, I may rescue my mother in the same situation because I spend time longer with her than my girlfriend. However it is the story in emergency and I think he should not be blamed even if he chose rescuing the girlfriend. What is the problem is the law admitting distinguishing. In Japan there was a law about killing one's ancestor, but it is thought illegal for now because telling murdering ancestors from others is against Japanese constitution. I believe improving Chinese way of thinking about human rights as Japan. The other is that anyone should sit the exam to be a legal occupation freely. Such as the first point, human must be treated equally. Of course, discriminating men between women is illegal. A person who prepared this question may assume male students. I think that if the person considered female students as well as men, he can't make such a question. What is suspected as a cause of this way of thinking is a low percentage of female legal occupation. I want women take the exam more regardless of opposing wind."
NBE07350,"I also felt this question and the way examiners treated people who answered girlfriend are just ridiculous. If I were the one who answered girlfriend, I cannot tolerate for losing points with my answer. There are a lot of ways of thinking, and examiners should score with respect. The standard for scoring must be how logical the students support their choices. But before talking about the way they scored, I wonder if this is a suitable question when considering of rights of all the people. On the other hand, I think it is really natural that nobody cares about the sexual problem because the question is just on the assumption."
NBE05753,"I was surprised at this question. I think the felling that he want to help his girlfriend is as important as want to help his mother. Preciousness of life is not changed for everyone. So, it is natural that this result is controversial. Furthermore, the gender discrimination problem is also serious. Women is not assumed that the answer. If there is a woman that if received the test, she would have thought uncomfortable. Also, in Japan, lawyers and doctors are likely assumed men. We need to go to change the consciousness for the society that women can success more."
NBE05749,"I think so too. If I was faced with the circumstances his mother and lover is dying at the same time , it will can not help calm. So, this question does not have meaning to think. In addition, I think that it is unscrupulous itself that such a question in the national examination. They should reconsider the way of test."
NBE05750,"I think so too. The problem choosing his mother or his girlfriend doesn't have the answer. If we are such a situation as a matter of fact, we will be upset and be not able to decide. And, we of course want to help both of them. So, we should think how to help all if think."
NBE07168,"I agree with your opinion. The answer of China's Ministry of Justice depends on personal sense of values. Certainly, we are brought up by mothers and have longer relationship than girlfriends. But, People's lives are equal. Even a girlfriend is the one of important people. Therefore, they should reconsider this question ethically."
NBE05664,"You felt surprised when you read this article. I felt the same as you about that. You wrote that mother and girl friend are even ground. I thought that too!! Mother gave birth to me, so mother is person that it is very important for me. In contrast, girl friend is a favorite person. The nature fades especially in comparison with mother. But, I may become person that it will be important in the future. I do not think that all the people are equal. Some of them are important but others are not. But I am not available in girl friend with mother. China's institution is bad. We demand the change of the Chinese system. In addition, I think that there is a way in itself mistake of the Chinese country. For example, it is Disney, Doraemon, Konan, or etc. . . It is called by Pakuri. China should review all the society"
NBE06498,"I agree with you. Needless to say, it goes without saying that human lives are equal regardless of age or gender. So, this question doesn't have the correct answer in my opinion. And, I take the opportunity of reading this article to want to know Chinese low system compared to Japanese. It is impossible that the government makes such an exam question in Japan because all people are equal under the low. I guess that it is not natural in China that human rights should be respected. National Judicial Exam in China should change the way of test."
NBE07317,"I strongly agree with you. The question's way of thinking itself is fundamentally ridiculous. The question was based on the thought that people's lives are not equal. However everyone's lives are equal and can't be compared in terms of the degree of importance. I can't understand why saving the girlfriend is a crime and saving mother is correct too. I think the question has no answer. To begin with, the question make no sense. So, I think it is not appropriate for the official examination."
NBE05370,"When I read this article for the first time, there were some points that I could not be satisfied. First of all, it is very wrong to compare the value of his girlfriend's life with that of his mother's one in the National Judicial Exam, which anyone want to enter the judiciary or legal profession must pass. Accord to the people in the article, ""the law was unjust or 'ridiculous', especially in emergency situations where many lives may be at stake. "" ""People's lives are equal, they should be treated equally by the law. "" ""I have no idea why giv up your mum is a crime, while giv up your girlfriend is not. "" I think also that it is not possible to compare the life of the lover with that of the mother, so even if a person cannot save either life in the emergency situation, the person should not be judged or other people cannot judge the person because nobody is bad. I think that the argument was caused by the difference in the each person's recognition to the equality right. So I would like to give some examples of other countries' constitutions which prescribe what the equality right is. The first example is Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany. In the Basic Law, the universal content that all people are equal under the law is defined, and it shall not be possible for every person to suffer a disadvantage and to get the preferential treatment because of sex, family origin, race, language, homeland, origin and religious or political views. In addition, the equality of men and women have been clearly specified in the Basic Law. The second example is Brazil Constitution. In the constitution, it is said that all of the people are equal before the law without any kind of discrimination, and it is guaranteed inviolable rights to life, freedom, equality, safety and property rights under the follow provisions for Brazilians and foreigners to emigrate to the country. 1. In accordance with the provisions of this Constitution, men and women are equal in rights and obligations. . . . The final example is the United States Constitution. In the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the content about the right of equality is written. Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Since I mentioned some of the constitutional items regard equality of other countries as above, next, I would like to pick up an item about the equality of the Japanese Constitution. Accord to the provisions of the Constitution of Japan, 1. All of the people is an equality under the law, race, creed, gender, by social status or family origin, in political, economic or social relations, not discrimination. 2. Peers and peerage shall not be recognized. 3. honor, awarded the Medal other honors is not accompanied by any privilege. Award of honor is, actually has this, or only one generation of the future which is person who receives, has its effect. This section is intended to define the so-called equality under the law (which is one equal rights for five rights). Respect for fundamental human rights coupled with, and is intended to constitute one of the principles of the Constitution, respect for basic human rights is, whereas the mean inherently guarantee of rights possessed by each person, and under the law equality is to intended to ensure the sufficient rights even in comparison with others. This section as the ""family origin"", as referred to in paragraph 1, it is considered to mean the pedigree or pedigree. Lords after the Meiji Restoration in Japan, such as the do not allow the presence of hereditary aristocracy, such as nobility was born to mother aristocrats. While not deny that you awarded the honor of honors, etc. , this is it is assumed that it finds as long as that does not result in a privileged position or hereditary position. By the Emperor and imperial presence of an exception provision is constitutional Chapter 1 of expressly for this section, be outside the scope. In addition, pursuant to the provisions of the Civil Code, but the Emperor of - laws also exist, -laws of the Emperor is not hit in the aristocracy. It should be noted that, on the relationship that prohibits discrimination based on family origin, to be established accord to the ""family origin"" as ""a son of a politician"" and ""candidacy restrictions to public office politicians"" in the law ""prohibits discrimination based on family origin"" as a violation of the Constitution has been, it is also the provisions of which are incorporated naysayer to hereditary politicians regulation. In the enactment process of the Constitution of Japan, Emperor Showa for the abolition of the nobility, it is said to have been pointed out that ""Dojo nobility or can not (aristocrats born of nobility) only to leave"", sufficient consideration of such a proposal has not been made . In fact, at the stage of the GHQ draft and constitutional amendment draft outline as it is in the history of the follow between the nobility one generation of his lifetime has become a form that allows the Eishaku, and Kiji Shidehara which was also the own Baron also strong in this clause Good but it showed [1], (one of the Ashida modified) Modify passed immediately discontinued in the House of Representatives has passed this on draft street which has been passed by the House of Lords is also the House of Representatives. Law applied equality theory the mean of ""equality under the law"", there is a concept of law contents equality theory (legislator restraint theory), the mean of equality there is a theory that theory that an absolute equality, the relative equality . In addition, ""race, creed, sex, social status or family origin"" limited enumeration and capture theory, there is a theory that in an illustrative enumeration. The Supreme Court, as long as it is not intended to be based on reasonable grounds in accordance with this provision on the nature of things, have construed the provisions of the intention to ban the legal discriminatory treatment. However, in Japan, there was an incident on the law that became unconstitutional by the weight difference between life, although the incident was a murder case. The case was in 1968, 29-year-old woman at that time killed the father at the time 53-year-old who had forced to incest against itself in Tochigi Prefecture Yaita. It is referred to as ""Tochigi father kill incident, "" ""Tochigi father murder"". Next, I describes the Chinese Constitution that came to make this test. It has established for equality rights, and any citizens are all equal before the law (Article 33), 18 years of age or older citizens, ethnic, racial, gender, occupation, specifically that it is not discrimination by the difference of the property, etc. set. In particular, the provision of the own protection provisions against ethnic minorities and women in China has been suppressed for a long period of time. However, even though it has already been defined for equality by this Constitution, in China there is inequality between ethnic groups. The problem is Tibet problem. Disputes Tibetans with the culture of church and state match has occurred for independence and a high degree of autonomy from China. Recently have international issues as a human rights issue but the suppression of religion, freedom of the Tibetan people by the Chinese authorities. Tibet became of China in the late 18th century Hunt, Q but has a suzerainty internal affairs was remained in a state of hold the Dalai Lama Government Office. Despite to have established in the Constitution for equality, China is a vague sense of equality because there is inequality between ethnic groups. There is another point that I could not be satisfied. I think that it is very wrong that no one on the Chinese internet appears to address the sexist nature of the question. The test clearly assumes the test takers are male. I think that this is an obvious gender discrimination that is happen in China. I feel that it is regrettable that this kind of men and women discriminatory test problem appears in the National Judicial Exam, which anyone want to enter the judiciary or legal profession must pass. In conclusion, by pick up the items on equality of Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany and Brazilian Constitution and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Japanese Constitution and Chinese constitution, I considered what is the equality. Then, I think that the exam question in National Judicial Exam is Inappropriate in terms of the equality of people's lives and gender discrimination."
NBE06499,"I am opposed to your idea. They cannot certainly save both their mother and girlfriend under this dangerous situation. There is something in what you say. But, it is very important for lawyers to treat equally people's lives and right. They need to make a right decision according to each situation. So, I think this question is not proper as the national test of choosing the lawyers."
NBE06887,"I was surprised to read this article because I have ever heard this question, ""Which of your girlfriend or mother do you save from a deadly fire? "", but I couldn't believe the official organization made this question in the official test. I think to make this question isn't correct. People may have their own opinions and answers as a lot of people discussed online. I think each person has he or her answers, for example ""I would definitely save my mother first. Apart from legal reasons, my mother raised me. Plus my girlfriend is younger, which means she has a better chance of escaping the fire on her own, "" and ""People's lives are equal, they should be treated equally by the law. "" However the official organization's deciding the correct answer is not virtuous. It is true that in China, there are teachings that you should make much of your parents, but that is no reason for the official organization's putting special emphasis on parents. Anyone has freedom of thought, so the official organization's controlling their minds by deciding the correct answer is illegal. If I am Chinese, I don't want people that passed the test as this article to become judicial officers."
NBE05787,"Surely, at first, this premise that examinees are male is wrong, but Chinese posture that mother is prior to girlfriend is proper. Because, parents are regarded as important from the old in China. Of course, all people should be equal, but Chinese society is based on this system. I think it's good to keep this posture in the future."
NBE05904,"I agree with your opinion on some points. "" human should be treated equally regardless of sex, position and one's religion. Approving to rescue the mother from burning building instead of the girlfriend means admitting discriminating persons with their attributes by the law. "" - I agree with your opinion. All people must be treated regardless of sex, religion, race etc. . . . . This is an essential factor of modern society. This human right is a constitutional right. "" I may rescue my mother in the same situation because I spend time longer with her than my girlfriend. "" - I agree with this part of your opinion too. The proverb says, "" Children do not realize how much their parents love them. "" , I think so. My parents love me more than any other people in the world, so I want to repay an obligation by rescuing them. "" What is the problem is the law admitting distinguishing. In Japan there was a law about killing one's ancestor, but it is thought illegal for now because telling murdering ancestors from others is against Japanese constitution. I believe improving Chinese way of thinking about human rights as Japan. "" - I agree. When I heard this story about old Japanese law in another class, I was very surprised. I cannot believed such a law. That is unconstitutional clearly. Even if there is a strong effect of Confucian philosophy in China, I hope that Chinese way of thinking about human rights is changed. ""anyone should sit the exam to be a legal occupation freely. Such as the first point, human must be treated equally. "" - I agree. I think that more and more kinds of people should be a legal occupation, because they have to aid many kinds of the weaks (the economically disadvantaged people, the physically handicapped people etc. . . ). Thus, they have to have a right understanding of them. "" A person who prepared this question may assume male students. I think that if the person considered female students as well as men, he can't make such a question. What is suspected as a cause of this way of thinking is a low percentage of female legal occupation. I want women take the exam more regardless of opposing wind. "" - I agree. Though this test was checked by many many people, this question was not withdrawn. I cannot believe this. I want to be a lawyer in the future, but I am anxious about a male society."
NBE07449,I can not understand why they decide order. And I can not understand the criterions of this judgment.
NBE05878,"This is so an interesting topic for us, the students of law faculty. Maybe among us there is people who are studying to pass the same kind of examination, so we should think enough about and discuss the question which we should give priority to our lovers or parents. And it is natural that this question asked in the exam heated arguments on online, for it is a little too unique one for a state examination. Personally I think, this question is not substantial but must not be simply said to be ridiculous. Of course, it is impossible to compare the importance of life of each person. The Japanese constitution article 14 says ""all of the people are equal under the law and there shall be no discrimination in political, economic or social relations because of race, creed, sex, social status or family origin. "" This is true even for the people who are in close relationship to us. So we cannot answer the question in the respect of jurisprudence. The question is asked in the examination to be the expert of it. In addition, the test was held by the state. Therefore, it is inevitable for it to be criticized by many people. But, I guess that the purpose of this question was perhaps to ask the students how they think deal with the many difficult problem they will faced with in the future. The students taking the exam were people who wants to be a lawyer, a judge, or a jurist and play an important part in the judicial world of the next generation. Sometimes they would suffer from the same type of the questions which are very, very difficult to make an answer. It is easier to have his or her own answer, but as a professional of law, they must make a fair one everyone can agree with. In this case, they have to think dispassionately using laws, and sacrificing personal feelings. If the question asked students whether they can do or not in this way, I think it is the greatly meaningful question. In fact, I do not know the real purpose of it, nor the question format. When it was asked by just selecting the two options, it was not so a good question. But when it was asked by description form (opinion question), it was an accurate one to know the students' spirit and resolution for their future job."
NBE07259,"At first, I was surprised and I thought its test was very very terrible. Because I think that people should be treated equally regardless of sex, position and one's religion. If we choose to rescue the mother from burning building instead of the girlfriend means admitting discriminating persons with their attributes by the law. In the same situation, I think I will rescue my mother because I spend time longer with her than my girlfriend. But it is the story in emergency and I think the boyfriend should not be blamed even if he chose rescuing his girlfriend. In Japan there was a law about killing one's parent, but it is thought that is not permitted for now because telling murdering ancestors from others is against Japanese constitution. I wish to improve the Chinese way of thinking about human will change like Japan."
NBE06945,"I think that I should not add a difference to life. Thanks to mother who gave birth to oneself, the love are great and are surely changed into nothing other. It is about normal exceedingly that I can think in this way. However, as for being one life even if it is life of mother, and being the life that received life again in the world, a girl friend is the same. She has mother and is born in the same way as all. Even if it is mother, life does not have the difference and thinks that you should not attach it. In addition, I think the examination in quest of such a problem to review it."
NBE06768,"I agree with your opinion. I also think this question has serious problem and is ridiculous. If I were in this situation, will confuse which should I help. As you say, I also think that we should not compare the human life, because people's lives should be treated equally. But I think that is difficult. I don't think that life itself includes equality, inequity. I think that social handlings include inequity. For a viewpoint closely social as for it for life itself. When a person dies, everybody holds a funeral. By influence during the lifetime, it is different in a scale and contents. I think that the sense of the dignity for the life is the same. I think that after all, the life is not a thing that is not to be able to guess in equality or inequity. It can be only said that all life has a meaning. So, I can not understand the reason why a question setting person sets the question like that. Hundreds of thousands of trainee lawyers and judges in China don't need it."
NBE06944,"I am for your opinion. I think people should be treated equally regardless of sex, position and one's religion, too."
NBE05928,"When I read this news first time , I was very surprised . This news point is that the story of a man who chose to save his girlfriend from a burning building over his mother, saying his actions amounted to a criminal failure to act. I think that this is ridiculous and unbelievable. The life of individual people is equal and we cannot judge which life : mother or girlfriend is more important. There are sentence of ""China's Ministry of Justice confirmed it was the correct option four days after the exam, saying that a son is legally obligated to save his parents over other relatives and loved ones"" in this news. But not every people were brought up carefully by own parent. So, I do not agree with this sentence."
NBE06047,"I think this problem is very difficult and important to think about crime law system. Now I belong to the law department of Keio University and study law. So I know complexity of this problem and I also know both girlfriend's life and mother's life are so Irreplaceable that I sure they cannot decide which they should save. In the first place, all life is holy equally. But now, often the rule is broken in foreign countries. It becomes the problem about the human rights in every country. And the murder must be permitted in no country. It is not permitted morally. So Cruel organization including IS must not be permitted. On the contrary, saving life is very splendid, I think. The person saving anyone should be praised. In this case, though two people must have died, he was able to save one. When he gets rid of another one, he must be troubled and sorry very much. So we should not make pursuit. He is innocent, I sure."
NBE05547,"When I read this article, I was very surprised at the point that law students told that saving girlfriend instead of mother is a crime. I think this problem is difficult to choose which is a crime. So, I wonder why this problem was set question for the National Judicial Exam. Therefore, I want to think about this problem from two situations. At first, I suppose that I am in a position to run the bar examination. I think that considering about multiple choice options is important for the people wanting to enter the judiciary or legal profession because the situation they have to judge can happen. If the situation happened and they didn't think about that, they couldn't cope with that situation correctly. And also, if they can't think about an unpredictable problem, they didn't work correctly as a lawyer, a judge. So, I agree to the opinion of state media that the test is most exacting. Secondly, I'm going to think about this problem as a law student. I think this problem is unnecessary. Comparing girlfriend's life with mother's life is totally useless, To begin with, we should not consider that which life of person is more important. In this situation, we didn't know why he decided to save his girlfriend instead of his mother. I think he chose the best way that time. He could not save both his girlfriend and his mother. I think that he helped her like a man in a trance. He did not have the fault. He was exposed to dangerous states, too. The man who saved his girlfriend instead of his mother didn't break law. I think this problem was not suitable for the National Judicial Exam. In this way, I think about it in tow situations. Personally, I prefer the opinion of law student. We should not compare the weight of life. I think this problem is unnecessary in the National Judicial Exam."
NBE05823,I was surprised to read this article. At first I don't understand why they put a question like this on National Judicial Exam. Because I do not think there exits the right answer. Also I don't think we should choose any of which because our lives are equal. I will never understand why they put those questions on the National Exam and they really should haven't. In addition to that Chinese people should complain about the sexist nature of the question. Since the test clearly assumes the test takers are male. Chinese female should speak out for that.
NBE06123,"I was very surprised when I read this article, because China give a quiz without answer in a national examination. It is different by a person which people help mother or girl friend. National examination is very important examination for keeping the security of the country. And the answer to this problem will be related to the sense of values of the country, so people cannot answer easily this question. Therefore I think that it not good to give a quiz without the answer in a national examination. However if this quiz is given me, I answer that I help my mother, because my mother brought me up and girl friend is still young."
NBE06122,"I agree with you. I was very surprised and this news is bad. This question leads to the discrimination of the person. I think that there must not be the discrimination. And if this question is given me, I help mother, too. Probably many people will be same answer. However I think that we should not answer such a question. I wish that thought of China changes."
NBE06558,I agree with you very much. We should not settle the worth of others 'lives because our lives are equal. This question is terribly unsuitable for the National Exam in two points. First point is that the answer and thought about which is more cherished differ from person to person. Second point is that this question is a kind of sexist. I think China have to develop in the aspect of not only economic but also morality. Chinese people have to demand that the government respect the human rights.
NBE05877,"I strongly agree with you. I also think that this exam asked the student how they do when they are forced to answer the ultimate question. They must have worried when they looked at the question at first, but this might be the just purpose of the National Judicial Exam."
NBE06399,"I think that the test takers of this exam should consider another situation. Because in this modern society, many things would happen. So, lawyers takes many tasks which we cannot expect. In this exam, the test clearly assumes the test takers are male. Should a woman save her father or her boyfriend first? Test makers do not consider woman's situation. If her house is burning, should woman save her husband, boyfriend, son, or grandfather? If we think about that problem, we have to consider the points which is different from men's situation. For example, in common sense woman is consider to be weak. So, her husband says she save herself. Or after this happening, many people say ""Why don't you save your daughter? As those many things change from his situation. Lawyers should deal with many difficult tasks. Let's look at Japanese situation. In Japan, the equality of woman and man is written in the Japanese law. So, above the law, if woman don't save her husband, nothing is problem. A statement of fundamental rights and privileges (especially the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution) is written in Japan too. As above, many things change in another countries. China has been a complex mix of traditional Chinese approaches and Western influences. Lawyer have to solve many difficult problem according to the custom of his county. The two major Chinese philosophical schools discussed below, Confucianism and Legalism, strongly influenced the idea of law in China. Briefly, under Confucianism, the state should lead the people with virtue and thus create a sense of shame which will prevent bad conduct. Under Legalism, law is to be publicly promulgated standards of conduct backed by state coercion. The tension between these two systems is that Confucianism relies on tradition to make the leader the head of household of all China, while Legalism makes standard law that even the emperor should be bound by. The common factor is that both endorse to different degrees a paternalistic conception of the state, which knows better than its citizens and makes laws to protect them. This concept persisted throughout the imperial period, into the republican period, and can still be seen acting today. I think this topic's problem comes from these Chinese tradition."
NBE06649,"When I read this article for the first time, there were some points that I could not be satisfied. First of all, I think this kind of question is a bad question. Why do I think so? Because this kind of question's answer varies to each one's own. I think one's most important things is not defined by one things. Our treasure of life piles up by many occasions. For example, one can make person who can give one's precious love, one is blessed with children, and everyday petty concerns. In this way, our choice of most important things can be different case by case, so this kind of question force to choose only one thing. Therefore this question's answer cannot cast from a single mold. Secondly, this question was a question of national judicial exam. Originally, public examination's answer like National Judicial examination should be only one absolute answer. But as I mentioned before, this kind of question varies person to person, so we cannot make suggested answer by tangible standard. By the way I would like to look this topic from other viewpoints. Maybe among us there is people who are studying to pass the same kind of examination, so we should think enough about and discuss the question which we should give priority to our lovers or parents. And it is natural that this question asked in the exam was controversial on online, for it is too unique one for a state examination. Personally I think, this question is not substantial but must not be simply said to be ridiculous and must be think deeply. Of course, it is impossible to compare the importance of life of each person at ease. So, I guess that the purpose of this question was perhaps to ask the students how they think deal with the many difficulties they will faced with in the future career of lawyer, judge, or a jurist. The students took the exam were candidates who wants to be a lawyer, a judge, or a jurist and play an important part in the judicial world of the next generation. Sometimes they would suffer from the same type of the questions which are very difficult perhaps nearly impossible to make an answer. It is easier to have his or her own answer, but as a professional of law, they must make one fair tangible answer everyone can agree with. In this case, they have to think dispassionately using laws, and sacrificing personal feelings. If the question asked students whether they can do or not in this way, I think it is the greatly meaningful question. In fact, I do not know the real purpose of it, nor the question format. When it was asked by just selecting the two options, it was not so a good question. But when it was asked by description form (opinion question), I think it was an accurate one to know the students' spirit and resolution for their future job."
NBE06525,"I have the same idea as yours. This question will lead to discriminate among lives. As you said, ""regardless of whether he is only morally responsible or he has a duty to support, the two lives are equal and can't be compared in terms of the degree of importance. "" The answer of this question is not important; this question's existence in itself is the important matter. What there is an answer is wrong. At the same time, I can't believe this exam assumed male examinees. Is it able to say to discriminate gender as the mother and the girlfriend? Although I want to be a lawyer in the future, I became afraid about equality. I'll keep my opinion in mind."
NBE06464,"I think that this problem of Chinese bar examination is fantastic. I will do choice to help mother if I say forcibly. A woman called mother is mother all the time from now on. However, the girlfriend may not be so. Mother is existence of only the one in space. Furthermore, the correct answer seemed to be mother in the answer of Chinese Ministry of Justice. Still, this problem is very interesting because we can get a glimpse of the human's nature."
NBE06153,"I agree with your opinion. I also think this question is very serious problem. We should not prioritize the value of life. Why did person setting this question set it? I can not understand it. However, there may be Chinese cultural background which Japanese can not understand. So, if we thought this problem deeply, we would need to know not only it but also Chinese cultural background. Personally, I have a Chinese friend. So, I want to ask him how he thinks about this problem."
NBE06590,"I agree with your opinions. If I were him, I would get confused. Both of them are important people for him. I can not choose only one person. It is strange that mother should be saved over his girlfriend. Indeed his girlfriend is likely to escape the fire on her own, but we should not treat their life irrespective of position. Life is equal. We must realize again the importance of it"
NBE06677,"I was surprised when I read your opinion, and I was convinced. After thinking it over carefully, it's a discrimination for girls. Surely, this article is lack of consideration. It was written in boys' view. We need a point of view of gender. For example, Boys don't necessarily save girls. So we need to consider some of gender problem."
NBE05956,"I think that this question is too difficult. Our lives are equal and should be equal. So the question which makes students choice which to help is ridiculous and nonsense. And I cannot believe that China's Ministry of Justice said that a son is legally obligated to save his parents over other relatives and loved ones. They mean helping girlfriends over parents is illegal. However if I were in such a situation, probably I would choose to help my mother. There are some reasons why I think so. First, mother is only one. Nobody can take place of her and my mother raised me for a long time. The other reason is that girlfriend is younger than mother. So the possibility of escape of girlfriend is higher than mother. For these reasons I would choose to help my mother. However I hope this kind of situation will not come true."
NBE06648,"I agree with you. This kind of question doesn't have genuine correct answer. Person's life should be viewed equally each person. If we come across this kind of ultimate situation, we should choose a choice which any regret doesn't remain behind our choice."
NBE06375,"Lawyers and judges need to have knowledge and skills to deal with many legal issues. Trainee lawyers and judges might have to solve a life-threatening issues if they are able to be the legal professions. However, I think that those questions are not suitable questions toward trainee lawyers and judges, because this situation is very serious and they will probably lose their power of accurate and clam judgment in that situation. To be sure, the legal professions must have the ability to judge and make the right assessment under any circumstances, but I think that the judgment to legal issues and the threat to life of family are completely different. It seems to enjoy the reactions of examinees. In addition, this question lets examinees to be weighed the importance of life in a balance. That is an unbecoming way for the legal professions to behave. Therefore, no matter how many times I tried to understand the meaning of the question, I cannot get the drift. I thought a crucial choice does not need on a legal examination after considering that question and its main points."
NBE06300,"I think that saving girlfriend instead of mother is not crime. Saving girlfriend itself is great thing, even if you can't save your mother. If I am faced with this situation, however , I will save my mother instead of my girlfriend. There is only one mother in the world, but girlfriend isn't only one in the world. If there is crime in this case, it is that you don't understand the importance of your mother . It is also true that father is only one around the world . so you should know your father is great and willing to save him instead of your boyfriend."
NBE07287,"When I read this article, for the first time, I was very surprised at this news. And I feel it is very difficult to understand this problem. I feel that the lawyers and judges have to have many knowledges about strange case. But there are many points that I can not consent to. To begin with, the law which legally obligated to save his parents over other relatives and loved ones are strange. Originally, people's lives are equal so everyone have tone dealt with equally by the law. So I think it is ridiculous to decide how to deal with this problem. But helping mother have a point in some aspects. There are many girls in the world, but my mother is a only one. So depending on the idea, this way of thinking is possible. But If i faced this situation, I would ask my girlfriend."
NBE07041,"I think that China's Ministry of Justice is not right. It is mainly because people's lives are equal. If it was almost impossible to help mother and it was almost possible to help girlfriend, should I go to help mother although both mother and girlfriend would die? It is ridiculous that I miss the life of girlfriend, which I can help and try to help the life of mother, which I cannot help because it is illegal to help girlfriend Human should be treated impartially. It is wrong to compare the life of the person and to give an answer. I doubt Chinese sense of values."
NBE06463,"I am against your opinion. Surely the life of people is equal, and there will not be the right to choose a life of either mother or girl friend as us. However, this is an examination question to the last. In other words, a proper answer exists. According to Ministry of Justice, it is said that the examinee should prefer the duty as the child to romantic love, and it is said that the person who chose to help the girlfriend is imposed for the crime by what ""Crime of non-action"" that is nothing did. Apart from the contents of the problem, I think that it is established as a problem for the time being as far as there is such a proper answer. Still, I can never deny the opinion that this problem is against morality."
NBE06911,"I think it is so difficult to answer this problem so both my mother and girlfriend are valuable persons. But if I need to have this answer, I will try to rescue my mother from a burning building over my girlfriend. Certainly, many people may criticize me for sacrificing my girlfriend but I think it is the best idea which has a possibility to be able to save both lives. Naturally my mother is older and weaker than my girlfriend so the person who needs to help is my mother. Even if it is an all-or-nothing contest, I want to select the means which do not compare my mother with my girlfriend but sacrifice nobody. If I answer this idea, I cannot pass the National Judicial Exam because I don't choose either woman. But I don't think if someone rescues his girlfriend over his mother, the action is a crime. That is because there are many ways of thinking who should be rescue and we don't know which way is right. Though in Edo era, the idea that we should treat our parents respectfully than any other person was more deep-rooted than now, nowadays I think the idea that all people are treated equally generally become to spread. So whichever woman you choose, it is true. The important thing is that you have enough consideration to both women."
NBE05849,"When I read this article first time, I was surprised that such a difficult and controversy question like choosing his mother's or girlfriend's life was included in the National Judicial Exam in China. However, I strongly believe that the question was very nice and worth question in that test. There are two reasons for my idea. First, questions that the public cannot decide only one right answer exist a lot in the world. If future judges and lawyers pass the test, they are obliged to deal with questions that we cannot decide one right answer. Second, although the question like choosing mother or girlfriend's life does not have only one right answer, judges and lawyers should hear and understand all answers. In addition, they judge that something is good or bad just only based on laws and their conscience. Next, I would like to talk about the rightness of the answer of the question. China's Ministry of Justice confirmed it was the correct option saying that a son is legally obligated to save his parents over other relatives and loved ones. I think this answer is out of date. Modern societies' paradigm is based on egalitarianism. According to legal equality, it is not forgiven for a son not only to be prior his mother's life to his girlfriend's life but also to be prior his girlfriend's life to his mother's life. Therefore, it is ridiculous that his not to rescue his mother from a deadly fire before others, including his relatives and loved ones, amounts to a criminal failure to act. As a result, I think it is natural that he is not guilty. By the way, the writer told us that the question included in the aspect of sexual discrimination. I strongly agree with this idea because the test assumes the test takers are male as the writer told. Of course, should a woman save her father or her boyfriend first? Finally, I would like to talk about my choice for this question. Apart from legal reasons, I am prior to my mother's life basically. However, if I decide to marry my girlfriend, I rescue my girlfriend before my mother. The reason is the importance of my following life. I believe that my finance is more important than my mother for my following life."
NBE07039,"I agree with your idea. As you said, the reason of China's Ministry of Justice is lacking in persuasiveness. If China's Ministry of Justice mentioned enough reasons, this question cannot become a question, because people's lives are equal. If I faced such situation, I would try to help the both."
NBE05848,"I strongly agree with this idea. I also believe the problem which chooses his girlfriend's life or his mother's life doesn't have only one right answer. People's lives are equal. Therefore, we cannot decide it. If we are such a situation as a matter of fact, we will be upset and be not able to determine. I cannot comprehend that people in China are legally forced saving their parents over other relatives and loved ones. Moreover, you said, ""the best way is saving all of them, so we have to think this way every time. "" I think that this idea is the perfect answer to the ultimate question."
NBE06740,I agree with your opinion. They lacked an important viewpoint of the equality of human life for this examination of China. They who made this examination should think about ethics once again. I think the true answer to this question should be logically explanation about equality of the life and this question was strange to ignore the ethic.
NBE05718,"I was very surprised to read that the question, ""Whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire"", I agree with the person's idea who think that people's lives are equal, so they should be treated equally by the law. Of course ""Girls are everywhere, but I only have one mum. "" But, saving only mother from a deadly fire is not correct option I think. Regardless of whether he is only morally responsible or he has a duty to support, the two lives are equal and can't be compared in terms of the degree of importance. And, I cannot understand the reason why a question setting person sets the question like that. Hundreds of thousands of trainee lawyers and judges in China don't need it. Probably, it based on idea of Confucianism. It thinks that I make a great difference whether it is not a family or a family. As for making much of parents, this idea is great I think. But this question is not suited for in the National Judicial Exam, which anyone wanting to enter the judiciary or legal profession must pass. National Judicial Exam in China should change the way of test. People's lives are equal, so we should treat them equally. I think this question doesn't have a correct answer. So I think this is a ridiculous question. Chinese thinking is old therefore this must be changed in order to up-to-date If I encounter this situation, what I should do? I do not know. Well, I do not have girlfriend so this question may not relation to me."
NBE07261,"I agree with your opinion. This test made in China is very strange and terrible, because the question ""Whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire"" means to compare the value of one's life. I think that we should not do such a thing, and this test ""Whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire"" made the Chinese to do such a thing. So I think this test is strange and terrible. Then, I wish that Chinese have different way from this test to think about human's life, at first. After that I want to think this problem how to treat a life of human any more from now on. And we should think that how to spread one's mind or thinking to other people who has different opinions. It is always difficult thing, I think. But I want to exchange our opinion with people who has different opinions and foreigners more!"
NBE05822,"I have never come up with that idea. They might be thinking by Confucian way. But you should not say that it is a old way to think, because there are a lot of things you can learn from they way people used to think. So I think it might be better if they put the concept of the equalization into Confucianism."
NBE07228,"The most interesting point of this article was the difference between the ways of reading text of man and woman, I thought. This theme made me remember an event I experienced when I attended the class of Germany. In that class, teacher said ""Please translate this word 'niche meiner Schwiegermutter' from Germany into Japanese. "". This mean 'my mother-in-law's niece' in English. Of course I meant she is my wife's mother's niece. But my girl class mates meant her husband's niece. Though we read the same sentence, the different character we saw in the sentence! It's not a surprising thing generally at all. But, since I usually relatively deal man and woman as same thing, I strongly felt the difference of sex there. So, when I saw the opinion""The test clearly assumes the test takers are male. Should a woman save her father or her boyfriend first? "", I remember this memory."
NBE06797,"When I read this article, I was surprised at the thing which human is not treated equally. So, I think that National Judicial of Exam should review their idea ."
NBE06796,"When I read this article , I was surprised at the thing which human is not treated equally. So I think National Judicial of Exam should review their idea."
NBE05576,"I strongly agree with your idea that the problem choosing girlfriend or mother doesn't have answer, and people's life is equal, so we cannot decide it. However, we must make an effort to understand the doctrine of Confucianism which is deeply connected with the Chinese culture. The Confucian has moral concept indicating that a child has to follow faithfully to the parent. This is in the root of the doctrine. This is why the answer that we have to save our mother in situations where the mother and girlfriend are drowning can be understood. I hear that teaching of this Confucianism parents unconditionally is based on the premise that love children. Based on this condition, in the situation where a child and husband are drowning, what selection a wife should chose?"
NBE06374,"I agree with the points of that I cannot understand the intention of this question either, but I do not think that Chinese people usually help their mother or father because of Confucianism. Even if they have a religious thought of Confucianism, they might be not influenced by those religious thought. If they make decisions that they help their mother or girlfriend with the religious thought, and that seems to be considered the life of a girlfriend is not treated equally. That goes against the legal mind. I think examinees should think calmly and write an answer without any religious problems. However, this question probably does not have an answer. In addition, I do not understand what the general idea of the Chinese and European is. I do not think they have a specifically idea that they might help their girlfriend. I also think who need to know an answer of the question, but I thought people who made this examination want to know the response capabilities of the trainees in a serious situation."
NBE07015,"The law is quite silly. The correct answer depends on many different factors. Do you and your wife or girlfriend have a child together? If yes you should save her before you save your mother. How old is your mother. . . . if your mother is over 60 you should save your girlfriend first. . . . She potentially has more years left to live. There are many other factors, like their health, how much you love them, and which one's death would affect less people in a negative way."
NBE07040,"I disagree with your idea. It goes without saying that the problem and the answer exist. It is not logical that ""there is the appropriate answer because this is the problem of the examinations"" in your criticism for my having criticized the answer that China's Ministry of Justice thought about. You cannot understand my thought and what I want to say. On the examination of China's Ministry of Justice, the answer that they thought about is, not to mention, right, and in contrast, considering our ethic and moral, the answer is wrong completely. You should have the idea same as my idea because you said, ""Surely the life of people is equal, and there will not be the right to choose a life of either mother or girl friend as us. "" I want you to reconsider my opinion and this article well once again."
NBE05927,I agree with your opinions which the reason of China's Ministry of Justice is lack of persuasiveness. I can't understand people are legally obligated to save their parents over other relatives and loved ones in China. I think that there are rights to choose option.
NBE05521,"Of course, I know, creatures of life is important and equal. However I think that thinking this question is not a problem because it is a mere question. So, I disagree with your opinion."
NBE05955,"I think so too. I think we are not able to answer this question. Our lives are equal. In my opinion, the question which forces students to choose which person will you help is itself nonsense. However taking it into consideration that the question is made in China, it may be influenced by the thinking of the Confucianism, which say we should take good care of older people. I can not help thinking that the man or woman who made this question is so stupid."
NBE06194,"I think that test makers have all responsible. This incident is, in summarize, that answer in the National Judicial Exam is against ethics. Moreover, there are several choices in question. Test makers should consider choices in question when they make exams and weren't criticized about choices in question from general people. Especially, the exam is the National Judicial Exam. Test makers should pay attentions very much and they knew that. If the incident occurred in Japan, it will become a very big problem in society. The incident occurred in China, needless to say, it became the one of biggest problems in China. By the way, why did such a incident accrue radically? Fault of the National Judicial Exam system? Lack of test makers? I don't think such reasons. I think that the reason is separation between law and common sense. Of course, in common there is separation between law and common sense, but it isn't allowed because it accrues such a big problem. It runs short of test maker's efforts only to solve this problem. All people who know law much must do their best to solve this problem. If they do, this big problem will be solved in future. Moreover, there is the problem in only China. The problem may occur in Japan and there is some possibility of doing. Not becoming so, we always pay attention for separation between law and common sense. I as one parson learning laws will consider this problem and this incident."
NBE06193,"I agree with your opinion. Originally, we can't decide value of human life and all people's lives are equal. I can't choose girlfriend or mother. However, Chinese government decided value of human life by legislation. Chinese government's decision and the question were allowed against ethnic. I was very sad to think people answering the question which don't have answer in the National Judicial Exam. So I think Chinese concerned with law should protest Chinese government's decision and disagree with Chinese government's answer. Such incident may occur in Japan. when it occur in Japan, I will protest Japanese government's decision and disagree with Japanese government's answer. Certainly, law is a strong rule, but the most important thing is that ethics is one of the strong rules, too."
NBE05954,"I can understand what you want to say, but just calm down and take a deep breath. I recommend you to reread this article again. The question is just the story of man. Is it right to say that the question is really sexism? I cannot think in that way at all. I am sorry to say, but you are a little too sensitive."
NBE05957,"You are right. we would upset and couldn't make a good decision if we were in such situations. There is also the possibility that we wouldn't help neither of them. To summarize, the question is nonsense."
NBE07199,"I disagree with your idea that the girlfriend is not only one in the world. Actually, it is sure that the girlfriend doesn't have her clones. Her individual life is the only one that no one else has. Then on the term of life value, you can't compare to each other. But i understand that understanding the importance of your father and mother is quite necessary. Without thinking about legitimacy or crime, we should maybe save our parents because they raise us with money that they earn. If we lost them, we would have to live off ourselves. On this point of view, we can't say that saving girlfriend or boyfriend is better."
NBE07198,"have to live off ourselves. On this point of view, we can't say that saving girlfriend or boyfriend is better."
NBE05691,"When I read this article, I found that all human being are not treated equal in China. First, China law says a man who chose to save his girlfriend from a burning building over his mother will be a criminal, and second, even though this is The National Judicial Exam, very formal, it clearly assumes the test takers are male and don't consider female. When I saw this problem at first time, I think it didn't have one answer but the reason is important. However, according to China's Ministry of Justice, 'A son is legally obligated to save his parents over other relatives and loved ones. ' It is true that we should respect our parents who raised us. And I can understand the opinion that girlfriend is younger than mother, so she has a better chance of escaping the fire on her own. However, I think it is wrong that the law decides and compares people's lives. By the way, our country, Japan had a similar law before. Parricide murderer was punished more severely than other murderer. But for a long time this law had been criticized that violated Japanese constitution which say people should be treated equal, and was finally annihilated in 1995. I hope China also will realize it is a serious problem that human rights are unequal."
NBE06828,"I agree with your opinion that the problem choosing girlfriend or mother doesn't have the answer. If I were in the same situation, I could not choose answer. Ministry of Justice said to save parents over other relatives and loved ones was the correct option. However, I also think that its reason was lack of persuasiveness and it is not suitable for the important exam."
NBE06711,I can understand his opinion because many people do not realize the importance of their mother.
NBE05751,"I think so too. We should treat our lives equally. The host decided the true answer was helping his mother. However, I think helping his girlfriend also respectful action. And I also think such question do not have useful to people who take the exam. They should learn more useful things for helping people by using law. I think, they should have a widely view."
NBE06072,"First of all, I am thinking in this way. If there is a girlfriend I love for me, I choose the girl friend over my mother. Although, so many answer, so many people. I think China is backward on the legal field. In China, the traditional values of the Confucianism influence lows. However, this is not compatible with the new global standard. Looking from different angles, the law is a rule which lay down difference of value between ascendants and others. The present day, there is no this kind of law in developed countries. For example, Japanese current Penal Code replaced the provision about murder of ancestor in 1995. China should extinguish the law or change the legal interpretation. There is an opposition to Ministry of Justice, a Chinese lawyer said ""a son is legally obligated to save his parents. So if he doesn't help his family when his family is at stake while he can help him/her, he is accused of negligence. However, if he can help one before the other is injury, it will not be accused to put off the mother. "" I agree him. Finally, when I read the last paragraph, I couldn't understand perfectly the meaning. Isn't this by chance? I wondered. That's probably one of the evidence of that feminism is backward in Japan."
NBE07262,"I disagree your opinion. But I think that your opinion is very interesting. I think that it is very difficult thing for everyone to see one's mother's die, because she has brought up us for a long long times. And mother is one person who is related to us by blood directly all over the world, so it is impossible for us to compare these two people and think whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire. I think mother must be one's only mother, and most valuable person."
NBE06741,I have some questions to your opinion. What do you think that they should decide criterion a of this judgment?
NBE07101,"This article is about the ultimate moral decision. There are questions and arguments that will never be solved or receive consensus from everyone. There are always being positive and negative stance and idea for any topic discussed. However, what I am talking about here is that the issue that includes a wide variety of opinions. In addition, the argument of the article, whether to save your mother or girlfriend, has neither majority nor minority stance. What I mean is that there are 50% for both opinions such to save your mother is right or to save your girlfriend is right. I thought about this issue for a while but never come up with a definite answer. And found out how silly this argument is. As I said, this argument is about moral of priority. China as a country states that your mother is more important that your girlfriend which is about the priority of moral. For example, I think saying something bad about someone pointing his or her back from behind is a bad thing to do. However, this kind of behavior usually is not counted as a crime. Of course, in some case when the situations are way too serious, that kind of act are counted as a crime and punishment will be executed. Other than those special situations, saying bad things about someone is very normal things to do for most people. Therefore, I felt the very awkward first time I read this article. There will never be a definite answer. The only way to end the discussion is to not to think about it."
NBE07316,I agree with you. I think the question doesn't have an answer. It is not suitable for official exam's question.
NBE06074,"I have the same ideas on some points, but I disagree with your main opinion. As you know, this question is for the official judicial examination, so it doesn't ask us ""Which do you help?"", and ask people who will be lawyer/judge/public prosecutor if his actions amounted to a criminal failure to act. As far as there is the law, this case is possible to occur, and successful candidates have to work with the law. So, this question makes sense and suit for the official judicial examination. In my opinion, China should delete or change the law for both person to be judged and person to judge."
NBE05456,"When I read this article, I was surprised that to save girlfriend became your crime. However, it is difficult to decide which is better. People's life is equal, but if that choice turn weather family or others, most of the people may save family fast."
NBE07504,"At first, I was really surprised that Chinese people made the question at such a serious exam like the National Judicial Exam. And it is ridiculous that saving girlfriend instead of mother is a crime. We don't know who would be the first that we would save. It really depends on the situation especially in emergency situation. For example, in this article, one man said if his mother and his girlfriend in the burning building, he would definitely save his mother first. However, if his mother was still be able to walk very well and she was just by the front door and his girlfriend was in the furthest room from the front door, I think he would go to save his girlfriend first. It is okay that we discuss this question in private or not serious situation, but I thought it is very sad that many people have to choose one in the exam. We have no rights to judge people who said he or she would save his girlfriend or her boyfriend instead of mother. I really agree with the opinion in this article that people's lives are equal and the law should treat them equally. I think it is very inappropriate to ask many trainee lawyers and judges such question."
NBE07505,I agree with your opinion. Our choice depends on not only blood relation ship but also in the situation where we are. I think nobody wants to compare the worth of our lives but I think some people might say that he would save his girlfriend instead of his mother because he likes his girlfriend better than his mother. But of course people's lives are equal so it is wrong that many trainee lawyers and judges are forced to answer such question.
NBE07506,"I thought it is true that the question made people compare the value of people's lives. It means the person or the organization which made this question don't think that people's lives are equal. We might not save both of them, depending on the situation but we can't judge."
NBE07493,"Some years ago, there were TV show named ""Harvard intensive class"" (Japanese title: Harvard nekketsu kyoushitsu), which was hosted by some university professors and they gave some topic to audience and made audience think about that topic. I still remember one of their topic was ""if your train was about to crush into 5 people on the right side of the road and you found only one person on the left side, would you try to make train take left? in this situation, you would kill one person, but you would save five person. is it better? "" When I saw this news article, I suddenly recalled this program. I'm not sure what was the best answer, but professor on TV said it is the matter of whether we choose good result or good moral. I'm sure there is no answer and at the same time there are so many answers. Justice does not exist in only one way. and also what people think is Justice is not true justice sometimes. For example, I think the way of United States treat other countries especially communist countries is as if there are no justice without violence and war. It might be. but is it justice if it is filled with blood or death? what I wrote might get off the subject, but I wanted to say people should not decide what is 100 percent true justice and what is not. especially for the people who will judge people in future, they should not have one certain typical way of seeing something. if they label crime and justice, crime will not be understood why it is happened because people who judge it have ""typical cause and effect label"" In order to grow good layer, this exam question should be changed. and also gender slight should be lost as well."
NBE06616,"I have belonged to the Faculty of Law Department of Law and I learn the laws, such as the Constitution, civil law and criminal law. The civil law and criminal law among them is easy to relate to us. Court give a variety of judgment by the situations in the case of performing the trial using the civil law. For example, judgment is changed by how many circumstances can the victim know in the fraud. But criminal law adopts basically nulla poena sine lege and court can't give a crime not to be written in the provision. Chinese criminal code adopts nulla poena sine lege too. Then, Japanese court give the judgment like above case in the Chinese criminal law? As a result of the search, the case taken up greatly wasn't exist but some people said it was exist. The people has a variety of opinion about a judgment court have ever give. But, even if we must help our mother to obey the criminal law, they are human. I am a civil service examination to become a government worker and some the problem of a examination let me answer what judgment the accused should accept. I don't want the problem like which case I accept a judgment."
NBE05048,"I agree with you deeply. Who should be saved in this situation? I think the only answer is that it depends on the situation of their relationship. The relationship between the son and mother is not always deeper than the girl friend. And the condition of the two ladies does not expect from this document. So, I also think that this question is ridiculous."
NBE05049,"I have a same opinion. This is a serious ethical problem. To take this exam, the new lawyers are decided. But, this question cannot answer unless they paralyze their fair feeling."
NBE05050,"In addition to my former opinion, I didn't know that the system of becoming a lawyer is really different from the country. In Japan, the bar exams yield the least number of successful candidates worldwide. The old format of the examinations, last held in 2010 saw only 6% passing the exam."
NBE05080,"It is difficult the simulation. I can't answer the question. I think that if I choose one, I regret the answer. So , the question is so difficult for me."
NBE05212,"I think that it is so difficult question to answer. Many people think that both their own mother and girlfriend will be safe is the best way. In the article, there is an idea like that. """"I would definitely save my mother first. Apart from legal reasons, my mother raised me. Plus my girlfriend is younger, which means she has a better chance of escaping the fire on her own, "" one man reasoned"" (quoted from the article) This is understandable. Simply, this question is too extreme speculation. I can not choose which way is better , if really I were in that kind of situation. Law students are also same. However wise in the terms of law, it is difficult to answer and to think from the sight of lawyer. This kind of question is too difficult, but I think it is meaningful think this question seriously and consider over this question from a lot of sights."
NBE05079,"I agree with your idea. The question's answer change the situation for example both people's damaged, age and location. Lawyers should treat equally people's life. The simulation is useful for lawyers because they can train themselves."
NBE05315,"When I read this article, I was very surprised. It is unbelievable to ask such question in national compulsory test. I have ever heard this question by my friends and it was interesting to think about the answer. My friend said that she asked this question to her boyfriend and he said he rescue his mother first on the spot so she quarrel with him. I think this question is interesting to debate with friends, but this is not worth asking in official exam. This is proper for asking with friends or in psychological test. This question have no correct answer so it can not to be graded. If the right answer is fixed, this is immoral question because people's lives are all equal. Deciding order to rescue at fire is wrong. In China, people who enter the judicially or legal profession must pass this test but I think this question is no relation to a trial. On the other hand, sexual problem is serious in China. This question should be rewritten to gender equality form. China is too thoughtless in various aspects so they should be more careful to decide the question in national exam and sexual expressions."
NBE05455,"I agree with your opinion. I also think that life of each person has same importance. We should not think which life of person is more important than others. Although the answer of this question is controversial, people have to notice that everyone has equal level importance of life."
NBE05155,"I feel sad to read this article, because the people who took that exam had to answer this question which do not have correct answer. People's life is equal. The order to rescue people's life should not be decided before. When we faced such a difficult situation, we have no time to choose the person who are rescued. But it is sure that a son is legally obligated to save his parents over other relatives and loved ones is not correct. This answer will be changed by the situation. My image about China, Chinese people respect their parents so much. But I feel woman's social status is still low position. About the sexist nature of the question, I feel sad. Because it is the outcome of the delay of the social advance of the woman. I think woman in China should insist more their right and social status. If the way of thinking of people changes, such a question will disappear from a test."
NBE05314,"I agree with you. This question is too ridiculous and no need to ask in national test. I think the best answer is to try to rescue both mother and girlfriend. It is very difficult to make decision that who to save on priority and it have no means for people. Make people who take the test think about to rank human lives is foolish idea. I think there is more important thing to ask in the test before asking such a question, for example, sexist problem."
NBE07065,I also think this question is too ridiculous. This question does not have the correct answer. We should praise the fact he saved human life even if he saved whichever of mother or girlfriend. People's lives are equal.
NBE07169,"I do not agree with your opinion. Certainly, it is difficult for me to save both of them. But I can't be businesslike about a matter like you and think. When I have to make a decision which to save, I will upset. It is not good, but I can't choose which to save."
NBE06020,"I am opposite your opinion. I felt the point is not that in this article. It is more important than to save mother or girlfriend that the question exists only for men. We have to recognize that seriously. We have recognized the wrong. Over the recent years, the Japanese society has come to gender equality. However, it has become a serious problem in the India. For example, situations such as marriage of women would buy with the money. Our eyes have to look at the world not only Japanese society."
NBE05477,"I researched. The category of this question. It becomes ""Crime of Omission (crime of omission)"". The crime that is realized by not performing an artificiality act of the ""uniformity with the crime of omission according to Koujien. There is it with ""When I make it plain, it is a crime to happen by not having done something. For example, it is a plain example to let you result in death without mother giving a baby rice. In addition, I include that I give another person it in silence while knowing it with the drink which harm enters. Chinese Ministry of Justice disclosed an answer later. The answer to this question was ""mother"". According to Ministry of Justice, It is said that the examinee should prefer the duty as the child to romantic love, and it is said that it is imposed on the person whom I chose when I help her for the crime by what ""Crime of non-action"" that is nothing did. I receive questions and the answer to this problem, and there is various opposition on the net. The problem to choose person either other as with mother at the time of ""emergency is funny. ""According to the ""law, the son has a duty to help mother. However, time when there is jeopardized another person is not written down in the law in the same way there. ""There is the ""woman anywhere. But mother is only one. I surprised this news. The way of thinking in China is not good. These examination questions vs. did it, and had a question, and how long would there be the confused student? If I will solve this problem, I am confused and will not understand to hear the answer either."
NBE05637,"I am against this test about the law of China. I think that it is strange that, of two acts to give priority to life of his mother or that of girlfriend, one becomes the criminal act, and the other is justified. It is not the figure which it should be of the law to regulate that you should give priority to the life of parents over other relatives and lovers. It is not the law that is suitable for the modern nation. In addition, I was surprised that a test to give such a nonsense question was ""one of the most exacting national tests in China"". It is not a bad thing to choose which choice, because the choice is decided by sense of values and subjective differences in each person. Therefore, the law should provide a flexible environment to accept the way of thinking of various people because the law should be existence not only to regulate the action of people, but also give freedom to the nation. The traditional custom and way of thinking are various in each country and area and local culture should be respected basically, but as a student learning law, I think that it is not good that such an irrational law custom exists. I want this old custom to be more flexible and rational."
NBE07492,I totally agree your opinion. how can put priority to human right? everyone must be equal and we cannot decide until we are putted in that situation. it is not matter what they chose and no one should be blame even that kind of situation was happened.
NBE06073,"I definitely against your opinion. It is obvious that Confucianism is very old. Confucianism was completed in 13th. Although contemporary philosophy keeps evolving in 21th. Is there concept of equality between the sexes or comprehension to LGBT? Of course not. Actually, there are some important lesson - for example, we should look after our parents well. However, we can't ""put the concept of the equalization into Confucianism"". I seem that almost Chinese don't think it is a virtue to help their mother with victim of their girlfriend now. It is impossible to keep pace with modern society while they put Confucianism on the central part of their values. So I think it might be better if they get the new ideology with the essence of Confucianism."
NBE05154,"I agree with your answer that the question doesn't have the answer. If we fall into that situation, we need to save people without adhering to the curious thought which we should parents firstly."
NBE05211,"I agree with you. All lives are equal. We can not say the answer. I think that this kind of question goes too far. I understand it is interesting because this question is too extreme too answer. I suppose that the answer to this question is not so important but imagining the situation and thinking what should we do is important. I think the answer is only date but the time we use for thinking what we should do is very meaningful for us. Actually, if we were in that kind of situation, I think we will make effort to help the both of them."
NBE05987,"I was surprised at this news. I think that there are not any collect answers of the question which was taken up in this article. I think it is an impertinent question. We should treat every people's lives fairly. However, some people who set this question, think that mother's life is more important than girlfriend's life. It is terrible. I hope that they correct theirs mistakes."
NBE05986,"I think so too. I think this question is impertinent because it doesn't treat two lives fairly. If I come upon such as scene, I will not be able to select one. If I save one person, another person die. Of course, if I can't decide, two lives are sacrificed. In the end, even if we do anything in this scene, nobody knows correct answer. Yesterday, I found a site on the Internet. It was known as ""can see only once in a lifetime"". The site asks you to choose your mother or a strange child. I think many people choose their mother. Then a strange child die. Even if you reload the site, the site display a message ""There won't be a second time"". So, you can't save a strange child's life. I think we should treat all lives fairly. However, there are the scene that we must choose one answer, even so there are not correct answer. It is the most important that you believe yourself."
NBE05341,"I was surprised at time when I read this article. This is because it is difficult whether I help a parent when oneself faced a crisis, or you help a lover. I really think that I cannot start answering that I do not face a crisis. This agenda was very difficult, and I thought that the conclusion was not given."
NBE06615,"I agree with your opinion. The law's purpose is to judge the people but it doesn't force the action to the people. My mother and girlfriend are important for me and humans. I think the situation I can help only one person is the unusual one. If I can help two people, I will help the absolute two people. The problem I think this question isn't suitable as a question of judicial examination."
NBE06987,"I cannot agree with this Nobel Peace Prize. I didn't know this news well, so I checked other article. As the article says, actual lives are terrible in Tunisia. Terrorism occur one after another, and unemployment rate is high. In other words, reality is far from democracy's success. I think it is strange that there is a wide gap between Tunisian National dialog Quartet and citizens, so I disagree this Nobel Peace Prize."
NBE07171,"Certainly, I think the Nobel Peace Prize is becoming the thing only for the name when I finished reading this article. Only the efforts in moving the North African country towards democracy cannot solve the all problems. But, it is difficult to solve all of them. Then how much contribution will deserve receiving a prize? We have to decide the range of it, and raise the standard up. If we can do it, the Nobel Peace Prize will become the thing which Alfred Nobel wished."
NBE06261,"I think that the Nobel Peace Prize are becoming a mere name. At first, some current winners of the Nobel Peace Prize are not suitable. For example, some winners assisted the war, some winners received the prize before realizing the peace. In addition, some winners seems unstable by other reason. For instance, like Tunisian National dialog Quartet, did not accomplish the peace movement. This winning seems the committee of Nobel Prize regards process as important than result. I doubt this way of thinking because the Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded with accomplished peace. All in all, I strongly believe that Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded with result of genuine peace. Also, I hope that the Nobel Peace Prize bring us the peace."
NBE07319,"I was very shocked to read the news. So far, I've believed without doubt that all people who be awarded the Nobel peace prize should be respected. However, after reading this article, my thought changed. If the fact which it says is true, I think needless to say the prize makes no sense. A part of successive Nobel peace prize winners' actions are inconsistent with contributions to world peace which originally should be praised by awarding the prize. I can't understand why such people win the prize who were concerned in a war, dispute or military action. How are recipients of the Nobel peace prize selected? I think the selection criterion is not appropriate. It is better to make that stricter. I don't want such people, for example, Obama, Kissinger and Hitler, to be winners of the award from now on."
NBE07482,"I was surprised to find that Hitler and Stalin had been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Until reading this news, I thought that the Nobel Peace Prize was always awarded to people who were respected by all the people and had been peaceful active to the end of their lives. However, my idea about it was wrong. I think that Barack Obama is not proper for Nobel Peace Prize, because he only gave peaceful speech, but he don't do active for peace. On the contrary, he is ultimately responsible for the recent US bombing in Afghanistan. His praise is just so much talk. I want the selective Noble committee to award the prize to those who are really active for keeping peace."
NBE05181,"At first, I was surprised how active and brave the Tunisian quartet were! In Tunisia, a lot of acts of terrorism have occurred and there are some radical Islamism people, so I had thought that Tunisians had difficulty in wishing for peace. However, I knew that the Nobel Peace Prize, which praised the person who was the closest to peace in the world, was base, so I thought who could decide what was peaceful in the earth? Also, I had felt that Obama had worked hard for peace, but it is not completely, I think. How can we have peace in our hand?"
NBE05436,"I think that Nobel peace prize is not fair and correct in every time. As this article, people who could win the prize moved for peace, but some of them did things which can destroy the peace. Further more, we have to remember that Nobel prize is made and operated by human. In short words, they includes individual thoughts. Actually, people who chosen by Nobel prize committee is famous for their action, but also they were chosen by individual vision. I think that the prize for Obama represents these problems of Nobel prize."
NBE05249,"I think the Nobel committee should think more about the situation when they give Nobel peace prize to someone or groups. In this case, the incident that Tunisia became a 'pluralistic democracy' was great in the whole history, but the reality in the country is far from success. They should not have given Nobel peace prize to Tunisian National dialog Quartet considering entire affairs in the country. Furthermore, in the case of Hitler and Stalin, they did cruel thing toward the civilian, so there was no reason that they should be nominated because of their activity. The Nobel committee have to think about not only the activity but also surroundings when they nominate or give some groups or someone prize."
NBE05248,I agree with you. Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded when genuine peace can be seen not only by Nobel committee but also by those who live in the country. I also hope that true peace will come by the existence of Nobel Peace Prize.
NBE05183,"Influenced by this article, after today's class, I searched Tunisian National dialog Quartet, and then, I found an event - Jasmine Revolution. The revolution was named after the representative flower of the country. At that time, Tunisia's unemployment problem was so serious, and many young Tunisians were not satisfied with the state. These situations caused the revolution of Tunisians. Tunisian National dialog Quartet, which worked for peace, was a very brave group, I felt. Also, the group influenced other countries. In particular, in Arab countries, some people raised revolutions against their countries' governments. The Tunisian Quartet achieved great activity for world peace, I conceived."
NBE07018,"I have already known that people who was awarded Nobel peace prize breaks world's peace. Therefore I was not surprised at this. I saw other people's comment and I noticed many people was surprised at this and says that Nobel peace prize should be abolished. It is true the fact the people who breaks peace are awarded should not be allowed. But Where are people who don't do bad thing? There are no such people in the world. Therefore, the system Nobel peace prize is awarded to people is bad. Nobel peace prize should be awarded to the action of committing to world's peace."
NBE05411,"When I first read this article, I was surprised and I thought that this is a worldwide difficult problem because the Nobel peace prize is a global valuable award, so it is difficult to withdraw prior award or change the conclusion. So, in this case, I think the Nobel committee should think seriously about not only their active's results but also the social situation in Tunisia. The quartet made a peaceful dialog and helped to find consensus-based solutions to a wide range of challenges which get over political and religious divides, so certainly, their working is superb, but it is said that their action is not worthy of Nobel peace prize. In additional, Hitler and Stalin were nominated before, but I think they were unworthy of the Nobel peace prize. To begin with, we should reconsider what is the Nobel peace prize and its standards for judging. Also, we should have a correct appreciation its actual value."
NBE05138,"The Nobel prize was started from 1901. It has six parts. Chemistry, literature, peace, physics, physiology, and medicine. It follows the Alfred Bernhard Nobel's last will and testament. He is from Sweden and is well known as a scientist who invented dynamite. Thanks to dynamite, he accumulate an extraordinary fortune. However, as you may know, dynamite is used as a weapon, so he became very sad and started to seek the peace. Therefore he decided to write will which asks building the Nobel Prize by using his almost all inheritance. After his death, Ragnar Sohlman and Rudolf Lilljequist found that prize. It is beginning of The Nobel Prize. As I wrote, originally this prize is started to keep peace, then those who receive it must be pacifists. Also, I think that the award ceremony have to be done peacefully."
NBE05137,I completely agree with you. People who receive the Nobel Prize must think deeply about these problem because this prize is regarded as the most famous and important and honorable prize.
NBE05274,"I agree that the Tunisian National dialog Quartet were award the 96th Nobel Peace Prize. 2011, the Arab Spring occurred, and a despotic state broken. The Islam party and the worldly party stood in opposition. Then, the Tunisian National dialog Quartet mediate between these party and established a new constitution. And it democratize their country. I think it's great. But, I cannot agree that Barack Obama was award the Nobel Peace Prize. Because, he just adopted that total abolition of nuclear weapons. And he did not carry out. I wonder why he was award the Nobel Peace Prize? I think there are person who are more suitable for the Nobel Peace Prize than Barack Obama. I think the reason why the Nobel committee gave it for him is he is famous and has influence. The committee did not think the contents. But I think it is the Nobel committee's fault. The committee should think over that who give it for before decide."
NBE05052,"Before I read this article, honestly, I am not interested in Nobel Peace Prize so much. Every year, I saw the result and know the prize names and thought that they are great. That's my relation to Nobel Prize, so I didn't research about them. However, I noticed that my habit was seriously wrong. This prize is so important for politics, history, and our studies. To know why they were awarded, how they were making efforts for peace are very interesting. In this article, it is said that not all nobel winners are recognized a good prize example now, but the time when they were nominated nobel prize, the situation and the social voice were different. We cannot say anything without to know about the sequence of events. Now, I interested in the relationship between the Nobel peace prize and the world affairs."
NBE05106,"To tell the truth, I didn't know this article. And, I didn't have a lot of information about Nobel Peace Prize. Read the article, I think I cannot agree this winning a Nobel award of the Tunisian National dialog Quartet. As Heffermehl says, I also think the Tunisian National dialog Quartet do not fit the model of ""a great visionary idea of peace"". I hope the Nobel Peace Prize become noble, no matter who looks."
NBE05105,"I agree with what you say. To be sure, The Nobel committee have to consider who or which groups are worth being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize."
NBE07201,"The attack to The Medecins Sans Frontieres is unbelievable since some innocent people who made lots of efforts to save many lives are now lost. They had realized that they are working for a danger place, so they had informed of their location to the U. S. army. Even though, the army bombed wrong place. They have to be sorry now, and regret for their whole life, this is that heavy. Human making mistakes is comprehensive, but they had already done the same things many times. About the awkward peace prize winner, I think they are deserve it since almost no one who exhale the word ""peace"", does nothing at all to keep or create peace even just around him. Compared to these coward, the winners deserve it."
NBE07202,"Your point of view is very exact. People say it is objective, but as all the words and ideas are thought and reified through our brain, it is perhaps never objective. However, to solve this problem, there must be much people to elect the winner. If we collect many opinions, we can make it closer to objectivity. In that case, There comes another problem that if one of them have more power than others, it can be like autocratic."
NBE05789,"I think the same opinion with this article, especially, the win of Barack Obama is unjustified. At first, the existence of peace prize is hard to choose because it is absolutely thing. As for Obama's example, he is not achieved anything, his evaluate reason is his posture trying to keep peace. As a result, he hasn't achieved to clear the nuclear power from all over the world yet. And then, like a Stalin, the person who contribute to peaceful activity while doing evil about to award some times. Of course, it's not hard to check all about one, but the committee should do the best to investigate. At any rate, Nobel Peace Prize lose substance, the committee may be troubled to choice person or groups, I thought. However, there is a fact that ""Not applicable"" is not accepted by many people. They expect new hero every year. So the rule I thought is ""don't give prize to people who haven't do something concretely yet. "" If so, the criticize will reduce and we can keep dignity of Nobel Prize. Is the peace only expressed by this form, Nobel Peace Prize? I think the peace is not think by comparison with force. The peace is condition which we don't need to think ""peace"" again."
NBE06744,"I think that the selection of Nobel Peace prize is difficult. It is a hairsbreadth distinction between peace and war. We cannot say the person who ended war is the symbol of peace. He may be opposed to military power by it and might bring peace. Even if he did not use military power, there is that some race became persecuted because of the person who prayed for peace. I think that it was right that Obama refused the Nobel Peace Prize. How many people would die cause of Obama's orders? We should not only respect the winners of Nobel Peace prize and also pay attention to the occurrence in the background of the receiving it and the later incident. And we must think about the meaning of the receiving it. I think Nobel Peace prize can realize an existing original purpose by it."
NBE07451,"By reading this article, I suggest one idea that Nobel Peace Prize Committee need not to give Nobel Peace Prize every year. Even if the committee give it to groups which far from pacifism and the wish of Nobel Peace Prize founder, the groups can move boldly and their ideas are in danger of being treated as pacifism by using the tittle of Nobel Peace Prize. So I think this prize should be awarded when something relevant to unchanging peaceful things (for example , saving degrees or giving best to lose discrimination. )happens ."
NBE05612,"I think that the Nobel Peace Prize is unreliable. This prize can be politically used, and have been so for many times. Certainly the wishes of the Alfred Nobel is wonderful, but this prize is getting corrupted. The example that the attack which Barack Obama, a Noble winner in 2009, was responsible led to the deaths of 22 people at the hospital run by MSF which was the winner in 1999 is so ironic. By the way, the international organization is usually unreliable. UNESCO registered ""Documents of Nanjing Massacre"" as the documentary heritage. I think that UNESCO will not be politically used and secure fairness and transparency. Like this, UNESCO cannot be relied on. The United Nations which has UNESCO, etc. is also unreliable. To consider carefully, the United Nations originally consisted of the countries which was hostile to Japan in 1945. After all, they will not protect benefits of Japan. Therefore, the international organization is unreliable."
NBE07452,"I agree with your idea. Groups and thinking that are at first looked peaceful may be changed by the international situation, so I think it is difficult to judge what is peace . By considering this facts , we should discuss what is peace . I think peace can also indicate the situation that there is no war."
NBE06770,"I was surprised at this article when I read it. I think homosexual is received gradually in many countries, but Japan has a sense of discrimination for homosexual. We should promote the movement that homosexual being received all over the world like 'gay and straight' traffic lights."
NBE06260,"I agree with you. Your investigation is great. I think Tunisia should diminish the gap between Tunisian National dialog Quartet and citizens. Additionally, we should reconsider the awarding system of Nobel Prize."
NBE06829,"I think that it's difficult for us to judge whether the Nobel Peace Prize winners are suitable or not. For people who support them, they respect the winners that they do actions for their peace. However, others are criticized the winners for they do actions that are not suitable for the peace. I would like the member of staff to see not only the result but also the background and effect."
NBE06262,"I think that your idea is quite unique. I checked the awarding record of Nobel Peace Prize to find that this prize has been awarded every year after 1973. According to this record, at the beginning, the prize reflected the wishes of Nobel, however, these years the prize is against the wishes of Nobel, and I doubt the purpose of awarding the prize has been used politically. I hope the prize should be awarded to the suitable person."
NBE06592,"I was surprised at this news. I think it is natural that people who won the Nobel Peace Prize are praised. It is a fact that war did not die out after having been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. However, they rendered remarkable services to the cause of world peace. Their actions are worthy of praise. It is impossible to completely get rid of war. There are various races, religion, culture in the world. Owing to different thought, war happens. The war will not happen if all of us respect thought each other. However, the war is not avoided because each person has strong faith. The war is miserable and cruel. Since it is impossible to completely get rid of war, we should work hard to reduce war. We should praise them who contributed to peace movements. I am proud of them."
NBE05054,"I agree with you. Whether the winners are suitable or not, depends on the world affair and the generation. So it is difficult to say the old former winners were wrong prizes. After 20 years from now, the result of 2015 might be said that it was wrong. I think that winners were certainly did a great job when they nominated, so every winner doesn't have to return their prize."
NBE07353,"I think we do not have to take away any Nobel Peace Prize from anyone. I would take President Obama as an example. Independent on Sunday columnist Cole Moreton criticizes Obama with the recent US bombing in Afghanistan as it causes 22 people to die. However, I think Obama made his decision to destroy the world peace. Although their death is sad, he always tries his best to maintain peace. I believe it is wrong to take the Prize away with one mistake. I hope people can respect Nobel Peace Prize more and actually before that, we must be more interested in. To be honest, I did not know a little-known quartet of groups from Tunisia won this award this year."
NBE06860,"I wonder is Nobel peace prize really has something meaning for humans? Nobel peace prize is very easily influenced by the age, politics, sense of value. . . etc so it is used easily by politics insistence. For example, Aung San Suu Kyi who is Burmese treated political prisoner in Myanmar. When she got the Nobel peace prize, Myanmar government opposite hardly. Another example, Barack Obama who prized approaching working for non-nuclear world but he decide to reinforce corps to Afghanistan and it is criticized that the flames of war was expanded. What do I want to say, the Nobel peace prize is only honor and not or more. There is no actual profit, and people don't move without actual profit so I think there is no meaning for Nobel peace prize for humans. It is only used politics influenced."
NBE07354,"I think your opinion is really sharp with a great reason, but I do not want to believe international organizations are unreliable. I think there might be some ways to fix those corruption. We should find solutions instead of complaining about it because there are people who need international organizations to help. How can we make organizations or governments to be for people? If you have any good ideas, I would like to hear."
NBE07230,"I think the word ""awkward"" is proper for this situation that people who appealed or relate to military force win a Nobel Peace Prize. But I also think this have a reason to be. To make a peace is to stop or finish any kinds of fights. Fight doesn't stop without someone who to finish it. If the one never appeared, the tragedy continues forever. Whether it is by military power or power of words, the finish of fight or truce should be admired to some extent. Ironically, Nobel Peace Prize just have fame to do so and very useful. So the prize will be used for various political reasons from now on too. This is one example of this ""awkward"" situation. The theme brought up in this article is based on many difficult reasons we cannot explain easily."
NBE06430,"I think so, too. Indeed, many people may think that Obama destroys the world peace. However, Obama must have believed that the world become the wonderful world someday, and Obama always did actions for the world peace. I know that man often remembers people's bad action, but man forgets people's good action."
NBE06376,"I think the Nobel peace prize winners should be people who are worth to be respected by many people in the world. However, some of the Nobel peace prize winners are unaccepted their award. I think we have to know their efforts and activities before people criticize them, because many people who suffered from any cause might be helped by their activities. If people still have critical opinions after they consider that facts, they should raise their voice in public."
NBE06914,"I think when Nobel Peace Prize winners are selected; the members of its selection committee need to ponder to find the most appropriate person for it. For example, they should invest not only a candidate's achievement and popularity but also faults or risks for the achievement. Certainly, to carry out it, it takes more times and it may cause the risk of making the selection difficult, I hope the most appropriate person is selected."
NBE06228,"It is obviously difficult to decide who is worth the Nobel Peace Prize, I think. One's action for realizing peace may not necessarily be the one that can work in the way intended for someone, because nobody can completely anticipate what would happen by his action beforehand. So now I think how we should decide the winner can only be discussed, not be clearly answered."
NBE05720,"I think that it's difficult for us to judge whether the Nobel Peace Prize winners are valuable or not. However I agree this news title 'awkward' about Nobel peace prize. In fact, war, dispute and civil war occur in the world. People think the Nobel Peace Prize is promoting peace. But, Barack Obama received this prize in spite of occurred US bombing in Afghanistan. I have some doubts about the Nobel Peace Prize significant. I seem to be inconsistency."
NBE05410,"I think your idea is very right. Hitler and Stalin's achievement were not worth getting the prize because they discounted human rights and the importance of life. If they got the prize, it means their achievement was right. I don't think so. Of course, Nobel committee ought to think the standards of this prize and its value, but also we should be more interested in and reconsider."
NBE07481,"I think so, too. After reading this news, I looked into what criteria the selective Noble committee uses in deciding whether a person should be selected. Then I learned that a criterion is unclear about a connection with actual services to the cause of peace. If the selective Noble committee had considered actual services to the cause of world peace, why Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi did not selected the Noble Peace Prize? I am inclined to doubt that notional interests and a social standing of a prize winner have an effect the criterion. The selective Noble committee should choose a prize winner more clearly."
NBE05549,"I have thought that the Nobel Peace Prize is given to the one who contribute to the world piece. For example, Martin Luther King Jr. , Mother Teresa, and many grate persons are awarded. However, according to this news, there are some people who don't deserve it. When I read that, I think that is true. Barack Obama occurred the bombing in Afghanistan, but he reserved the Nobel Peace Prize. This is awful. And also, in the past, Hitler and Stalin was nominated. I can't believe that. In my opinion, the system the awarded persons will be canceled when they act unsuitable action should be introduced to get back it's prestige."
NBE06156,"I agree with Nobel Peace Prize. According to this sentence, the problem that some winners of the Nobel Peace Prize do or did not contribute to peace essentially exists certainly. However, it is also true that the Nobel Peace Prize has been a symbol of peace. Do you know Malala Yousafzai, 17, is the youngest winner of a Nobel Prize in any category? In 2012, she was shot in the head by members of the Taliban in retaliation for her work to guarantee the right of girls to education. In 2014, she received the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to protect children's rights. Then, she said, ""This award is not just for me. It is for those forgotten children who want education. "" Now, she has struggled for girls to have the right to education. And her courage has attracted global attention. Thus, some winners of the Nobel Peace Prize contribute to peace honorably. When you discuss the rights and wrongs of the Nobel Peace Prize, you must consider the behavior of more Nobel Peace Prize winners."
NBE06158,"I thought that the author of this article had a very extreme idea when I read it for the first time. However, as I read several times, I began to think it gradually that there's reason in what he or she said in it. If a Nobel Peace Prize winner does an act against peace, he or she will be deprived of his or her Nobel Peace Prize. And, he or she will not do ""the awkward facts""."
NBE07016,"I agree with your opinion strongly. Because Nobel Peace Prize winners have broken many peace, Someone will say that they are not suitable for Nobel Peace Prize. However are there the people who don't make mistakes? The answer of this question is NO. Therefore I think also Nobel Peace Prize should be given to not people who committed to peace but to the action of protecting peace."
NBE07494,"I heard that the origin of Nobel Prize is that when Nobel invented dynamites for creating tunnel easily, people used them to kill people and Nobel made his own prize with money he earned by dynamite to contribute the society. Actually I think President Obama doesn't deserve Nobel Peace Prize. What he said does deserve but what he actually does doesn't deserve it. However, when I recall the origin of Nobel Prize I thought that sometimes what people meant to do is different what other people can see. for the people who is killed by dynamite, Nobel was killer even though it was not he meant to do. I thought perhaps President Obama might be the same. I don't agree what he did and it os true that seeing is believing but we shoudn't forget that sometimes saying is worth believing."
NBE06560,"I knew that two Japanese men were awarded the Nobel Prize this year, but I do not know this quartet of group from Tunisia were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The winners of the Nobel Prize in chemistry and Physics are mostly make a remarkable and clear achievement. But there are sometimes both pros and cons as to the winners of it in Peace. Actually some winners of Nobel Peace prize still do not solve the problems and achieve true peace. In addition, some winners did military attacks. I think it wrong to resort to violence with an excuse to realize peace, and it is not appropriate for the winners of Nobel Peace Prize. I don't want the Nobel Peace Prize to be an award in name only."
NBE05182,"I agree with your thoughts. I had not known about the news, too. We in Japan live in peace, but our living is unusual, I realized. Also, I felt that Nobel Peace Prize is not true award for peace, too. In Tunisia and some other countries, much terrorism occurs now, and these countries' economy is bad. I think that to get rid of a gap between citizens and their government would make the bad conditions better. In brief, to meet halfway each other is first step for solving the problem."
NBE07264,"At first, I was very surprised when I heard this news. Because I thought that Nobel peace prize winners should be praised all over the world and they have a stable position. After that I thought it is very difficult for me to judge whether Nobel peace prize winners are completely adequately or not, because I can not imagine. We should not pay attention to only Nobel peace prize winners' achievements and we should pay attention to those backgrounds too. If we can do that Nobel peace prize's value become more superior thing. And Nobel peace prize winners will be respected by more people, I think. From now on, I want to think world's peace more, and pay attention to Nobel peace prize's news carefully."
NBE07265,"I agree with your opinion, and I think so too. I had not thought about Nobel peace prize's worth enough. So I thought that Nobel peace prize winners should be respected all over the world and they have a stable position. But I noticed that its thinking is very shallow and not completely. And you said that you want Nobel committee to have a discussion carefully about a candidate is really should be awarded the prize or not, its opinion is true I think. After that not only Nobel committee but we should pay attention to movement about Nobel peace prize winners, I think."
NBE05157,"I had thought the person who get Nobel Prize has to move toward disarmament or try to keep world peace. But after reading this article, I had doubt that thinking. At the end of this article, henry Kissinger, Hitler and Stalin are introduced as a person who were nominated Nobel Prize. When I was a high school student in historical class, I learned about these people's act. I had a very bad image of these people such like unjust, cruel and evil. Because they killed many people and expand armaments. Hitler had massacre Jews. Stalin killed all the people who defy his order. According to this article, Kissinger actually was ""implicated in propping up violent right-wing regimes in South America"". Therefore I thought why they are nominated in the past. I think there are a lot of people who are more suitable nominated Nobel Prize than them. I do not really know about the choosing system in Nobel prize. But from now on, the system should be reexamined. If people receive Nobel prize, they can take a lot of money. Those money should be used to keep our world peace. So the prize winner should be chosen more carefully than before."
NBE05906,"I think this problem is related to ""What is peace?"". There are two kinds of peace: that by using armed forces or that by not using it. The former can be expected to be effective immediately, but make a sacrifice without exception. On the other hand, the latter takes a long time, but does not make a sacrifice. No one can say whether is better, so no one can give the right answer about who is worthy to be awarded the Nobel peace prize. It is nothing but a symbol of peaceful thinking, is not involved in the result of the actions."
NBE06527,"I think Nobel Peace Prize has two difficult points. First, the criterion of this prize is very vague. In other Nobel Prizes we can understand why the winners get the prize, that is to say, there are clear reasons of the prize. On the other hand, the Peace Prize's standard acquired to be awarded is very vague and sometimes there is not clear reason. Moreover, a number of the winner of this prize is famous people such as Sato Eisaku and Barack Obama. Therefore I consider it is more difficult to win the prize than the other prizes for common people and this prize depend more largely on the sign of world peace than congratulating one person. However I afraid that the criterion becomes vaguer to show us more peaceful acts and make the prize's value abase. Second, as the article, the prize is to go to people working for disarmament and against militarism, but arms are often used to make the aim come true. I think it is antilogy. Is to bring lasting peace to the world equal to getting rid of weapons from the world? I believe Barack Obama who was the winner of this prize and bombed in Afghanistan is unworthy of the prize. Such a person shouldn't be awarded and if the winner does an act inapt, he should give back the prize. As just described, the Nobel Peace Prize has hard points. I want the prize keep trying."
NBE07355,"I understand what you would like to say. It is really difficult to judge who has done the best to maintain the peace in the world. I know that some of the actions of President Obama leads to deaths of innocent people as written in the article, but he got the Nobel Prize in 2009 for what he has done. It was assessed by the world. Probably Obama and all the other winners of Nobel Prize are not perfect, but I do not think it is awkward that those people are awarded and nobody has the right to take it away from them."
NBE05665,"I cannot agree with the Nobel Prize. I read this news, first I thought offensive. I assent to Moreton's opinion. America was attacked by Afghanistan with Obama receive Nobel Prize. But, that was very good news that quartet of groups was receive Nobel Prize. The Financial Times wrote that only success story of the Arab Spring. I sympathized that phrase. It is very good sentence. There is the chosen thing while there is good Nobel Prize though it is a lie. Who choose it? I do not know any details about that. Of course, I do not know how to choose the Nobel Prize. I think that this must not happen."
NBE06501,"I did not know this news that some of the Nobel Peace Prize winners were unaccepted their award until I read this article. I also think that selecting Nobel Peace Prize has some problems. First, the criterion and reason of choosing Nobel Peace Prize is very uncertain. We can understand the reason the winners of Nobel prize in Physics and Medicine and so on are selected the awards. But, we sometimes do not know why the winners of Nobel Peace Prize get the prize. Second, the war gives rise to the winner and the loser. So, I think that person who is related with war and battle must not get the Nobel Peace Prize. In other words, we cannot measure the peace. Justice differs from person to person. I suppose I have no choice but to have this problem but I do not want the Nobel Peace Prize to be in name only."
NBE05666,"I thought that very surprised too. You wrote Nobel peace prize winners should be praised all over the world and they have a stable position. I thought that too. I do not know that how to decide the prize winner. I thought that they were chosen fairly and definitely. It could not be said that it was wrong, but it followed that you must doubt it. I can't say that all their opinions are wrong. But A should return the Nobel Prize. And you said that Nobel peace prize winners will be respected by more people. It is true. Nobel peace prize winner is respected by all of the people. So I will think that the prize winner of Nobel peace prize has to choose you carefully in future. Who will win it in the next fiscal year? I am really looking forward to that."
NBE05754,"I did not know the news until I have read the article. Only I knew about the Nobel Prize in 2015 was that Mr. Kajita and Mr. Omura got the prize. I think, the Nobel Prize has some problems. First, we don't understand it enough. For example, the fields are professional and difficult for the public. Consequently, we cannot understand the criteria for selection. So, the committee should explain clarity the reason for the prize. In this case, the matter is opaqueness of the reason for award. It is necessary to ensure transparency and to convince a lot of people. Second, they have to consider from various positions in particular the Peace Prize. If one is honored among the position that is hostile, conflict would become more terrible. Indeed, we have to try to know about the Nobel Prize more. Through it, we should know the news in the world."
NBE06502,"I think your opinion is very sharp. It is very difficult to define the meaning of peace. I think we should consider about ""What is peace?"" seriously. It is problem that the system of choosing Nobel Prize is not clear and vague. Some winners resort to military force and still do not resolve the problems. I hope that the Nobel Peace Prize will be in name only."
NBE07423,"Before I read this article, I thought the Nobel peace prize is a holy and great prize. But, I changed my thought when I finished reading it. I noticed an inconsistency of the Nobel peace prize. It is the fact that Alfred Nobel himself manufactured dynamite. Dynamite is the weapon of indiscriminate murder. So, I wonder the basis of this prize. By the way, this article focused the fact of the National dialog Quartet giving the Nobel peace prize. This commendation might not be the right act. But, I feel pitiful for other people who awarded the prize. If such an incident occurred again, the organization will change their standards of selection. I think that this incident caused decreasing the trust of the committee of Nobel. This article says Obama won the prize in 2009. I feel indignation for it. I want the committee to think seriously. Also, Hitler and Stalin were nominated. I do not know this meaning. I agree to what Moreton said. I think that we should abolish this prize."
NBE07424,"I have the same opinion. The Nobel committee gave the prize to Tunisian National dialog Quartet, but they did not success. So, they couldn't have been prized. I cannot understand the reason. We say the same things for Hitler and Stalin. I think that the committee should apologize to other great winners."
NBE05344,I live in Japan all the time. I think that Japan is a very safe country. Therefore I think that there is not a sense of impending crisis for terrorism and the war of other countries too much. I think that all people think that they will not be generated in one's country. The economy is in a terrible condition in war. We who live in Japan cannot do the imagination. I thought that I read this news and must think about war more. I had a sense of impending crisis when I did not know when war happened in Japan.
NBE05342,"I agree with your opinion. I think it is the Nobel committee's fault. The committees should think over that who give it for before decide, I think too. Your opinion is very good."
NBE06021,"I have recognized that Nobel Peace Prize is presenting for people who work for peace movement. This article says that Tunisia National dialog Quartet awarded, and I thought this prize is best. Because they work for peace without weapon but use dialog. No blood and no sad of people. But I was surprised at this article's last. From now, Nobel Peace Prize have nominated name of them. For example they are Hitler and Stalin. Hitler is familiar with merciless man. He killed Judea people and designated as war criminals. Stalin is Soviet dictator and he killed politics enemy. I wander that why are they nominated Nobel Peace Prize. My peace in my mind is not their works. So I studied for them works and find that. Hitler not only killed people but he was involved in the construction of the Autobahn. And it makes money for poor people because gave job to them. The view is present that Stalin had saved a lot of people at the expense of minority. So some people said that Stalin is hero. I thought factor which they nominated Nobel Peace Prize is for their good works. Nobel makes dynamite and it kills many people in some war. But he saved many people and has contributed greatly to the society. I think that Nobel Peace Prize include his mind that person to everyone failure."
NBE06912,"I agree with your opinion. In other day, I saw the news reporting about Tunisia. When the Tunisian knew that the quartets were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, they seemed to be puzzled about the decision. And I was sorry that the one Tunisian said ""I want to immigrate to Europe but it is difficult to do it. We want not the award but water and food. "" I think Tunisian democratization still is growing and never be finished. That is because the democratization makes no sense unless the citizens feel peaceable and comfortable. I think it isn't time enough to give Tunisia the Nobel Peace Prize."
NBE06913,"I also think the standards of the Nobel Peace Prize are too abstract to be the award which Nobel wished. Certainly, your opinion that we decide the range of deserving to receive the award is good. So I will take an example. I want to introduce ""The nations' approval rating"" as one of the standards of the Nobel Peace Prize. After meeting the existing standards of the award, as a final judge, if the person proposed as a prize winner can receive supports of 80% of the nation, then he (she) is selected as the award winner. The reason I take this example is that I was sorry for the Tunisian case. I know when the quartet of groups from Tunisia were awarded, the citizen didn't bubble with joy of the award and think the award should be closely related to the citizen. But there are some problems to realize my example. For example, to investigate the nations' approval ratings we need to take place something such as an election. But an investigation which all the people affect cost vast money. But I think it is good idea since the nation's opinion can reflect a result."
NBE06125,"I think that people of all over the world should think about the meaning of Nobel Prize. I searched about Tunisian National dialog Quartet last month. Then I read article about Tunisian National dialog Quartet. The contents of the article about the number of the medal. Members of Tunisian National dialog Quartet are 4. However Nobel Prize hands only at most 3 medals to 1 group. Therefore Tunisian National dialog Quartet want 4 medals to organization of Nobel Prize. When I read this article I felt a doubt. I think that meaning of Nobel Prize is different from correct purpose. I think that Tunisian National dialog Quartet' purpose is medals, so I felt very sad. It's opposite to carry on activity for the purpose of Nobel Prize. Nobel Prize should be given to the person who left wonderful achievements. Therefore I think that people of all over the world, especially the person who gives Nobel prize should think about purpose of Nobel Prize."
NBE06124,"I agree with you. I thought that Nobel Prize is great prize before I read this article. However after I read this article, I thought that Nobel Prize have bad face. I want a person of all over the world to notice this fact. People should think about purpose of Nobel Prize and actuality of Nobel Prize. The influence of Nobel Prize is big, so organization of Nobel Prize should think that purpose to give, people to give and reason to give. I hope that I hope that Nobel Prize becomes a valuable prize."
NBE05879,"I also think that some winners of the Nobel Peace Prize are doubtful, but I would say no to the question whether these winner should give back their prize or not. Restitution should be not allowed because it might show that the prize is not so important. The Nobel Prize, especially Peace prize must be literally ""noble"" with great impact and authority. Sometimes, it was wan by person working privately (without governmental support, on the contrary, suppressed by it). It gives not only them social credit, but also the great power; cooperator from all around the world who agreed to his or her activity. For example, Malala Yousafzai. She was given the prize at her age of 17. People around the world focused on her due to the prize. We must pay attention to the meaning of the Nobel Peace Prize. Then, the problem of education for women in Pakistan became famous. On the other hand, we must not simply praise the winners. Of course, they should be looked up because at least they made some great actions which no other one could not have done, such as ended the war. But we must be skeptical to some extent. I think it is important for each ordinary people to think about the problem the winner dealt with, and have their own opinion about that. The power of public opinion is great, but fragile because it tends to influenced by wrong information from the mass media. So each person should make sure that it might not go in the wrong direction."
NBE07453,"I have never heard about this news, so I think that Nobel Peace Prize Committee should look for people who is appropriate to this prize. I think there are many people who help poor people from their tenderness, so these people are really applied to this prize . I have just read a lot articles about Nobel Peace Prize. By reading these ones , I knew some facts. The first one is that naturally Nobel Peace Prize Committee reward some one who makes the best efforts to promote friendships among countries or to reduce or distinguish nuclear or to hold worldwide meeting for peace with Nobel Peace Prize. Especially , only Nobel Peace Prize can be given to a party and the same person or group can get this prize many times. On top of that , Nobel Peace Prize can be bribed with big money. By being based in these facts , I suggest some ideas to choose Nobel Peace Prize winner. The first one is that committee ask people all over the world on the Internet who is appropriate Nobel Peace Prize. By using the Internet, almost every one will be able to vote this selection and person who is attending this committee will be able to know persons who has made efforts to make this world more peaceful. The second one is to change the system of this committee. As I have read above , only this committee has comprised of Swedish persons. As a result , this choice tends to be inclined to thinkings of European people , so I think that this committee should be comprised of many races. By introducing many races, choice of Nobel peace prize will be able to lose prejudices and get equality . As a result, people who is living in small country has chances to get Nobel Peace Prize. I wrote these ways with my only opinion, but if I talk about these things with my family or friends or students who are the same ages , we will be able to hit on many better ideas to change this situation and promote this Nobel Peace Prize"
NBE07454,"I heard your presentation at my English class . By listening to your presentations , I was able to know the Nobel Peace Prize system more closely . This Nobel Peace Prize committee can give medals at most 3 medals . And by understanding Tunisian National dialog, I can understand their purpose. I image that their purpose is not to make this world more peaceful but to be famous and to get money and fame. So I also thought that this group is not fitted Nobel peace Prize. And I think that this prize should not be given easily , so I suggest one idea to prevent getting inappropriate person. The one idea is that this prize should not give this prize every year . When appropriate person appears, this committee should search him carefully and decide whether this committee give Nobel Peace Prize."
NBE06345,"Winners of Nobel Prize have big responsibilities not only for their past but also for their future. It is the that they have done great things legally the world to peace but they do not do great things now. They should be the leaders of peace. For example, Obama may hope peace in his belief. However, he gives privilege to profits of the United States. He performs not as the winner of Nobel Peace Prize but as the president of the United States. I think that winners should know the importance of the role of winner."
NBE06227,"As mentioned above, it seems they sometimes give the Nobel Peace Prize to those who do not deserve it, which makes us discuss over the question whether the winners should give theirs back or not, and I think they do not have to. We should not regard the authority of the prize as cheap, petty one, and should respect the winners without discussion. Some people might think it ironical or even wrong, but I must say, if we want to enjoy our daily peaceful lives at ease, such attitude is indispensable to indirectly justify the peace as presented. Now I give further consideration about this point from a different kind of view. Let's start thinking about heroes and our need for them to worship. There is the limited aspect in which they are great, or greatly contributed to realizing peace, and there is the other one in which they are ordinary human beings like the rest of us. No great man lives constantly on the level of his vision, or on what we think he a great man spends his life. Our want for them to look up to however, generally makes us disregard or even deny what is in a man with a great achievement, and that is what I think sometimes make people be disappointed at them. So, somebody may say we should stop respecting such heroes without discussion and depart with dogmatic belief like that. But is it really possible for us to live completely apart from it? Can we remove every dogmatic belief from our lives? Ultimately, as you may think, we simply can't. Under no circumstances will dogmatic belief cease to exist, or, in other words, people will never cease to entertain some opinions on trust and, say, without discussion. Think what would happen if everybody undertook to form all his own opinions and to seek for truth (like investigating the Nobel Prize winner is worth the prize or not) by isolated paths struck out by himself alone. It would follow that no considerable number of men would ever unite in any common belief, which leads to the situation where nobody that greatly contributed to universal aspiration like peace would be publicly praised. Moreover, without such common belief no society or international consent would exist or be formed, say, rather, no general peace would do; for without ideas held in common there is no common action, for instance, deciding like what action is acceptable for peaceful world, and without common action there may still be humans, but there is no social body, which means no policing force exists to maintain public rules. (Let me put aside""the world's policeman"" here. ) In order that peaceful society should exist and prosper, it is necessary that the minds of all the citizens should be rallied and held together by certain prevalent ideas, and this cannot be the case unless each of them sometimes draws his opinions from the common source already formed and consents to accept certain matters of belief also already existed. In conclusion, from a shortness of your life, you do not have the time, nor, from the limits of your intelligence, the ability, to act in this way, you are reduced to taking on trust a lot of facts and opinions which you have not had either the time or the power to verify for yourself, but which people of great capacity have found out, or which the crowd adopts, and on this foundation you raises for yourself the structure of your own thoughts. And now I have to, or, rather, want to say, no other than this process will finally satisfy the real and vital purpose of the Nobel Peace Prize, and all the prizes already given are given to ""appropriate"" people."
NBE06888,"I don't agree with you. Actually, the world is not peaceful now, however, that is no reason for nobody's making efforts. The Nobel Peace Prize's reason for being is blamed, but I think it plays very important role. It is true that people who won it don't contribute the world peace completely, but their achievements shouldn't a little influence other people. If there isn't the Nobel Peace Prize, people may not have interests in the world peace. I think it is a symbol of peace, so it is necessary for people to continue to think about peace seriously. For example, Malala Yousafzai won it in 2014. She demand that all girls can receive the education. She was shot in the head by a group of armament in 2012, but she never gave in to this happening, she continued her activity. Of course, she was famous before she won the Nobel Peace Prize, but the news that announced her prize-giving made her the man of the hour. What do people think about by hearing this news? When I knew it, I had respect for her and thought about the world peace deeply. As this example, the Nobel Peace Prize and prize winners gave us the opportunity to think about peace seriously. You said ""the Nobel Peace Prize are becoming a mere name. At first, some current winners of the Nobel Peace Prize are not suitable. I doubt this way of thinking because the Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded with accomplished peace. All in all, I strongly believe that Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded with result of genuine peace. "", but I don't think so considering the circumstances mentioned above. Nobody is perfect, so people who won the Nobel Peace Prize isn't perfect too. If they don't contribute the world peace completely, I think they are suitable for giving it, because they give us the chance to meditate the world peace."
NBE06946,"I am against this article. This is because it thinks that it is not avoided the person that the Nobel Prize has contributed to war being given it. A person participating in war and a dispute, the person who, besides, produce weapons exist innumerably. There is no drill if I mind it one by one. With that in mind, I think that you should examine how long you contributed to the world. I think that I am given the Nobel Prize to a person playing an active part in various fields fairly by doing it this way."
NBE06947,"I do not agree with you. Nobel Peace Prize is only prize, so this prize is not super magic thing. We have to deal with actual peace problems little by little."
NBE05930,"This article said that it seems they sometimes give the Nobel Peace Prize to those who do not deserve it. Also there are sentence ""It's clear Nobel wanted the prize to go to people working for disarmament and against militarism, and who were building a peace movement. "" in this news. I agree with this idea. The Nobel peace prize should give the people who fight for peace and freedom without using violence or not cause dead people. So, in that point of view , Obama and Henry Kissinger did not deserve the Nobel peace prize."
NBE06428,"I disagree with you. I think that Japan is never a very safe country. Actually, a Japanese was killed recently by an Islamic nation. This incident is the beginning of nightmare. As for the next, the Islamic nation may attack a land of Japan directly. However, indeed, the Japanese who roused attention increased, but there is still little number of people. I think that the media should report more cases minutely. Outlook on ethic surely becomes the problem when the cruel scene is reported. However, the nation will not move by oneself unless they know seriousness and the cruelty of the case. Possibly, there may be the person becoming upset by seeing the news. Possibly, there may be the person who is shocked by looking at the real picture. However, we must look it in the face as a person living in the present age as far as it is plain reality."
NBE05880,"I see your point, but I have a little different idea from yours. I think that the purpose of the Nobel Peace Prize is not to measure the peace, but to praise some people who worked hard for peace. Of course it in not good that the reason of choosing is uncertain and there is the risk of the prize badly exploited by the government. But the most important point is due to winning the Peace Prize, the winner will get strong supporters around the world and the problem he or she had worked about will be known widely around the world. So I think this prize is meaningful."
NBE06049,"I don't know about Tunisia very much, but I can say what they do should be praised. But they must not be satisfied with it and they should continue making an effort to make Tunisia better more. Certainly still Tunisia's peace and order is very bad, I heard. So the effort must be necessary and other countries should help there. This is also important. Certainly developed countries are giving aid, but the social system is not improved only for money. They also should give knowledge. Though too advice is not good, the advice helps so much. And now it becomes the problem about Nobel peace prize. I want to say they should pay more attention to other problems more. Tunisian National dialog Quartet pushed forward one step of the beginning and from now more problems will be disappear. So they should think about the problem and other country will have to help them. These are the way to improve the poor country, I think."
NBE06988,"I don't agree with your opinion. I can understand your point of view. However I don't think that Nobel Peace Prize is not fair and correct in u time. Of course, there are some prize winners who are not suitable, but I think most prize winners make remarkable achievements Besides I think judges are always fair and never influenced by personal feelings"
NBE05788,"I don't think Nobel Prize Committee should be make cancel system because , if so, the trust of Nobel Prize would shake. Even today the reliance of it is weak. Of course, winner of it do bad action after awarded, but it is unnecessary to cancel because they deserves a point in this time. In order to keep this system effective as much as possible, there is nothing for it except for keeping today's system."
NBE05523,"I did not know that the Nobel Peace Prize are having such problems. I believed completely that Nobel Peace Prize was great award. But this thinking changed after reading this article. Especially, I was surprised by news about Obama. Obama has done four things roughly. First, he has created a new opportunity in international politics as president. Second, he claimed the role that can be played by the United Nations and other international organizations, and multilateral diplomacy has regained a central position. Third, he claimed as means for solving the most difficult international conflicts, dialog and negotiation should be priority. Fourth, he claimed a principle Without nuclear weapons in the world, and it gave a powerful stimulus to the disarmament and arms control negotiations. Thanks to Obama's initiative, the United States has played a constructive role than ever before. As a result he had won the Nobel Peace Prize. However, now, in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan, Obama is killing a lot of civilians by using the combat drone. Do we allow such person to be awarded as the Nobel Peace Prize winner? Of course, anyone will answer ""No"". Obama should return this prize as soon as possible. In addition, in order to become the award that anyone can trust the Nobel Peace Prize, future activities of person who are likely to award should also need to guess. It is necessary to determine whether the winner is appropriate until the person dies. In addition, peace and justice are iffy and unstable. So, by ideas, perspectives and position, we can judge variously. There will are strict regulations in the Nobel Committee of Norwegian a national assembly, but so long as absolutely neutral fair evaluation is impossible. So, danger which political implications arise can't avoid. Nobel Peace Prize is given for the person who do my best in fraternity between nations, the abolition or reduction of standing army and for the holding and promotion of peace conference. If we respect the bequest of Nobel, piercing ""no winner"" except for a person anyone accepts will be wise choice. We hope that Nobel Peace Prize become having significant value someday."
NBE06650,"I had thought the person who won the Nobel Prize has to go forward to world peace. But after reading this article, I've come to have doubt my consideration. At the end of this article, Henry Kissinger, Hitler and Stalin are introduced as a person who were nominated Nobel prize. When I was at historical classroom, I learned about these people's achievements. I had a very bad impression of these people such like evil. Because they killed many people. According to this article, Kissinger actually was ""implicated in propping up violent right-wing regimes in South America"". Therefore I thought why they are nominated in the past. I think there are a lot of people who are more valuable nominated Nobel Prize than them. I do not really know about the choosing system in Nobel prize. But from now on, the system should be under the discussion. If people receive Nobel prize, they can take a lot of money. Those money should be used to make our world peace and to promote peace other areas of the world. So the prize winner should be chosen more carefully than past."
NBE06465,"As for Nobel Peace prize in the present age, a selection standard is very vague and the prize winners is often criticized by people that he should not have won it. Therefore I think that people begin to have a question towards the value of Nobel Peace prize. The accurate selection will be necessary in the future so that Nobel Peace prize continues being a honorable prize by people."
NBE06528,"I think this problem is very difficult question. As you say, there are not any people who only do a noble act. On the other hand, everyone won't be able to admit the criminal one. Basically, I have the same idea as yours, so I don't want to abolish the Nobel peace prize. The meaning of this prize is not only praising the winner but also teaching everyone winner's noble act. Therefore, even if the winner does unworthy deed, the prize shouldn't be abolished to leave winner's achievements for the future. However, I also think that the peace prize cannot continue to exist. I have had some doubts about the basis of the prize for long time. That is to say, the basis of it is vaguer than other prizes'. I think the prize has no concrete standards, so winning it is too difficult for general people. In verity, the number of famous winner is much more than general winner in this prize. Then, I'm afraid of retaining the prize. As I have said, the problem of the Nobel peace prize is quite difficult."
NBE06679,"After I read this article, I was confused about Nobel Peace Prize. I can't understand what is Nobel Peace Prize and what the purpose of giving Nobel Peace Prize. For example, if person or people finish a war peacefully without using military force, I think it is value for him/her or them to deserve Nobel Peace Prize. But there are gap between ideal and reality. I remember Eisaku Sato when I think Nobel Peace Prize. He advocated 'hikaku 3 gensoku'. It is about three principals of a nuclear weapon. He won the Nobel Peace Prize because he ONLY advocated it. He didn't do anything. He didn't generate anything. He only said. Therefore, it is easy to win the Nobel Peace Prize. What the purpose of Nobel Peace Prize. I think it is lack of influence too. I think there is not any change after winning it. So I think it because a mere name. It is waste of money possibly. We may not be need it. So we should consider it."
NBE05522,"I agree with your opinion. I understood, in particular, "" I think we have to know their efforts and activities before people criticize them"". In reality, there are many people who don't know their efforts and activities. I think such people do not have a qualification to criticize. So, first of all, it is important for us to understand them definitely. You said ""If people still have critical opinions after they consider that facts, they should raise their voice in public, "" I think so too."
NBE05548,"I disagree with you in that you think the Nobel Peace Prize should be abolished. For sure, the person who was not good for the Nobel Prize won it, and Alfred Nobel, who made the Nobel Peace Prize, himself invented dynamite which is the weapon of indiscriminate murder. And what is most important thing is that other prize winner, like Martin Luther King, Jr. , Mother Teresa, who was good for the Nobel Peace Prize truly were to be pitied. I think you are right. However, I think the Nobel Peace Prize should be retained. Of course, there many problems in this prize. The standard of selection should be reconsidered and the system the awarded persons will be canceled when they act unsuitable action should be introduced. If the Nobel Peace Prize were abolished, conventional prize winners would be shocked. So, I think the secretive Nobel committee should reconsider what the Nobel Prize is in order to get back it's prestige"
NBE05524,"I know Malala Yousafzai too. The heart of millions of people ""Malala"" has finally won the Nobel Peace Prize in the youngest age in the history, She made history this time. Malala was nominated for Nobel Peace Prize in 2013 but She did not succeed last year. In 2014, She and Indian activist Kailash Satyarthi won the award jointly. However, Malala has become the youngest person among the people who have been honored with this award. She accepted the award and dedicated it to the young girls and women who are still far from the schools & education. Malala - the youngest human activist in the world who has been struggling for her own and other girls' education since the age of 9 years, She has been awarded many big awards such as Heroic Women of the Year Award , Sakharov Human Rights Award , Glamour Women Award of the Year and many more . She has been in the hearts of millions of people around the world, and the love and respect people has shown for Malala in the previous month has made her the most great person of this decade. I thought that she was a really courageous person. I respect her and I want to be a person which changes the world, like her."
NBE06681,I agree with you. I think Nobel Peace Prize have to change something now. Because I doubt whether winners make a contribution to world peace or not. And there is few person or people who contribute to world peace. So I think it is one of the good idea.
NBE07135,"I think Nobel Peace Prize is very prestigious prize. So I cannot agree with this prize. When I read this article, I didn't know the Tunisian National dialog Quartet. So I wondered about this prize. When I read this article politely, I thought they weren't suitable for this prize. When I think of the former winner of this prize, it's very famous and there are a lot of influential people. For example Malala, she is Nobel Peace Prize winner in 2014, she is very famous girl in the world. She did a lot of speeches all over the world and she made people of all over the world moved. So I think she's suitable for this prize. I think Nobel peace prize committee thinks and wants you to decide a winner tightly."
NBE07067,"Before reading this article, I did not understand the Nobel Prize. I thought, the Nobel Prize has global and absolute worth, and I thought only the person who really contributed to peace can win the Peace Prize. But this news changed my thought. I did not know that Barack Obama wined the Prize in 2009. But I know that the United States still continues intervening in various areas by force of arms and military cost of USA is top in the world. American politicians were sometimes nominated until now. After all The Nobel Prize seems to be strong in the political side. It is natural that the winning boosts winner's influence. So the selection committee should choose winners strictly and carefully. And above all, it is important for winners to take actions as Prize Winners. Separating from the thought of founder is sad. I want the Prize to become ""genuine Peace Prize""."
NBE06743,I am interested in your opinion that Nobel Peace Prize is becoming the thing only for the name. We should reconsider the need of this prize.
NBE07043,"I think that the Nobel Prize should be abolished or that the Nobel Prize should give the person whom world people accept the Nobel Prize, because It is difficult to define contribution to the world peace. Many Nobel Prize winners are criticized by this article metaphorically. However, how much they contribute to world peace in order to say that they deserve the Nobel Prize completely? If the Tunisian National dialog Quartet could stop all of the terrorism or If Barack Obama did not do bombing in Afghanistan, can they deserve the Nobel Prize completely? Nobody can answer. Those people who got the Nobel Prize contributed to world peace in order not to want the Nobel Prize. Actually they accomplished something which contributed to world peace. Therefore, I think that the Nobel Prize should be abolished or that the Nobel Prize should give the person whom world people accept the Nobel Prize."
NBE07289,"When I read this article for the first time, I was very surprised at this news. And I opposed the Nobel peace prize. I think the Nobel Prize have to be considered carefully and gradually. And I think Nobel Prize have to be the one that people all over the world happily accept. Indeed there is a gap between Tunisian National dialog Quartet and citizens. But I think it has a very important role . This award will influence on all over the world."
NBE06302,"We should understand the criteria of Nobel Peace Prize again. Nobel wanted it work for disarmament and against militarism, and build a peace movement. In this article, many inappropriate example of Nobel Peace Prize are showed. Neither of them led the world to peace. Before giving them Nobel Prize, we must consider if they brought peace, of course it is not short term one. As other Nobel Prizes have, Peace Prize should also have dignity."
NBE06401,"As the sentence of this article, Henry Kissinger won the Nobel peace prize in 1973 despite the fact the war went on for another two years and the fact that, he was ""implicated in propping up violent right-wing regimes in South America as well as bombing Cambodia"". Hitler was nominated in 1939 and Stalin in 1945 and 1948. As Moreton ponders, ""just how noble is the Nobel Peace Prize?"" One has to wonder. As those, it seems to be questionable that what is a standard yardstick. In every year, only one person win the Nobel peace prize all over the world. The greatest best person, group which is contributed to a cross-national friendly relationship, reduction, the abolition of armaments and the promotion of the peace conference can get this prominent prize. In this view, Hitler and Stalin can win the Nobel Peace Prize. Because, each person do not like war. And, they do them best not to happen war. But many people now think that they like to happen war to get more power. In fact, they do many bad things. For example, Hitler contained an Arab in Auschwitz and abused them. This is a very brutal thing and is not a permissible thing. But he concentrate on solving the problem among many western countries and America. So, we should look at Henry Kissinger, Hitler and Stalin at another view. We often think with many people's opinion. But, sometimes, We have to research many things about what is thought to be right. If we look at one things with another suspect, We will find new thing. This is very important thing. By the way, Malala won Nobel peace prize in 2015. Malala appeals about the right of a woman and child. . In addition, she goes for anti-war activity. We should follow her."
NBE07042,I agree with your idea. The member of its selection committee should research the candidate's career and pay attention to faults and risk of candidates and take time as long as possible until they give candidates the Nobel Prize. I think in such way more appropriate person would be selected.
NBE05851,"I think that the only people who contribute to the world ""real"" peace strongly should receive the Nobel Peace Prize. I believe that each country's leader had better proceed disarmament all over the world. If someone brings the world peace violently, violence always makes hate, at the end, the peace collapse. Alfred Nobel, the founder of the Nobel Prize, the inventor of dynamite who made his fortune as an arms manufacturer, clearly hoped to give the prize to people working for disarmament and against militarism, and who were building a peace movement. Therefore, the Nobel Peace Prize is the prize which should be given to people working for disarmament and against militarism, and who were building a peace movement."
NBE05850,"I agree with your idea. Certainly, the only people who contribute to the world ""real"" peace strongly should receive the Nobel Peace Prize. I believe that the Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded for accomplished peace. ""I hope that the Nobel Peace Prize bring us the peace. "" This is great!!! I was moved when I read the comment."
NBE06301,"I agree with your opinion. Determining criteria of Nobel Peace Prize is necessary to praise right person. If bad person like Hitler was elected to Nobel Prize, dignity of this award would lessen."
NBE07390,"In fact, I thought that this Nobel Peace Prize should be backed from Mr. Obama immediately at first, but now, it is odd to do that, I realized. Indeed, Mr. Obama's action, especially the aerial bombing, is very radical and unbelievable considering his speech. It is not too much to say he is a bloody liar. However, it is an indisputable fact that he made a speech named ""a world without nuclear weapons"", which brought his award, too. Its achievement itself must be unchanged even if he complicity to huge war. In addition, if he need to return this Nobel Prize, it is the mistake of Nobel Committee, not Mr. Obama's. It is to show that the committee should have awarded Nobel Prize more carefully, but they didn't. Because of these two reasons, I think Mr. Obama do not have to return his prize and I disagree with you."
NBE07389,"I think Mr. Obama do not have to return his Nobel Peace Prize to Nobel committee, because that prize is to magnify the honor to a good impact of his speech, ""A world without nuclear weapons"" and there is no direct relationship between this prize and his aerial bombing. These two facts should be considered separately and this is only a moral problem."
NBE07391,"Oh no! I should have written ""A world without nuclear weapons"", but I wrote ""a world without nuclear weapons"". Next time, I will take care about, sorry."
NBE07352,"I cannot agree with your opinion. I understand that the present situation in Tunisia is terrible, but it is obvious that Tunisian National dialog Quartet is trying their best to maintain peace. Probably we cannot see an expected outcome for now, but I believe their actions are the first step for Tunisia to build up its own democracy. I think Nobel Peace Prize does not have to go to people who change situations dramatically. Gradual change should be respected."
NBE06344,"I sympathize with your opinion. When I read this article, I was shocked. I think that people who awarded the Nobel Peace Prize are very great person. In my thought, Hitler is notorious war criminal. So I was very surprised. But history repeats itself. We should think about peace."
NBE07019,"I think the Nobel peace prize is most important to protect world's peace. It is true that prize winners did bad thing. However The action which they did is much bigger than bad action they did. For example I'll talk about Barack Obama. Barack Obama has fought and passed significant legislation to promote a nuclear free world and has communicated from the United States to other many countries. As well as he has worked to amend the relationship between the Middle East and the West. The only reason why many people think he should not have won is because the media speaks only about huge and noticeable stories or about wars. And many people do not even realize all things he has done to get rid of the gaps between our wounded world. From directing refugee funds, to creating Special Envoys to further assist Middle Eastern countries, to easing restrictions on Cuba as well as working with them for democratic reform so that they can mend their relationship with the world as well, to helping ensure peaceful and fair deals by Kenya and Somalia to work together in rightfully trying pirates, worked to better promote an end to genocide in Darfur, a fight against poverty throughout the world while providing tools to prosperity for many African and emerging countries (which will of course add to and improve the world economy), he worked to withdraw our country from Iraq knowing it would help ease tensions between the United States and the Middle East, outlined and promoted ideas to deal with the Israeli and Palestinian conflict, and he did indeed create a new climate in the air which was acknowledged by many world leaders who truly felt that the President had created an entirely new atmosphere in the world for dealing with problems. As a senator he has proposed plans to control the world's supply of weapons as well as biological weapons. He bravely stood up in public right in Hamas to argue that they must relieve themselves of all hostilities and deal with Israel pragmatically. He has amendments in order to create a plan for comprehensive immigration and ease tensions between countries. He has also fought for transparency of foreign aid and federal funds to fight for a more honest and less corrupt world. I think that most people knows about a few things of these things. Take these things into consideration , and you can understand the Nobel Peace Prize winners are honorable people."
NBE05577,"I am of the opinion that contrary to Nobel's will, Nobel Peace Prize is a founder, the award is not intended to be respecting the peace. Some of the Nobel Peace Prize winner, sometimes took the action that I do not think only to have promoted the war, there is irony also referred to as ""Do not to be referred to as the Nobel War Prize rather than the Nobel Peace Prize"". It said that there is also the side of the political appeal by Norwegian diplomacy. That Nobel Prize cannot be denied that there is a side that has been exploited as a political tool. Award to the person who has been a political prisoner in his native has also caused a strong opposition from concerned governments. In this way the Nobel Peace Prize is sometimes produce a new confrontation."
NBE05458,"I have a question about Nobel Peace Prize. What standard the recipient of the prize s selected by the organization. In the case of Obama, I don't understand why he was given the Nobel Peace Prize. Nobel Peace Prize is given a man who do his best to keep a peace. He did only announced the two times abolitions of nuclear. From the beginning , USA, surely any countries, should have had no nuclear. And now the nation continue to attend wars. I think his work don't reach the accomplishment of the prize. However, I think it is difficult for any one to achieve international peace. Human being have their own views each person. I think it is the origin of wars. Although Japan looks peace , for example, In your family during holidays some want to stay at home and spend a slow time. Other want to go anywhere. Here difficult opinions are born. This is also , but small, a war. In such a dispute if either may be respect the opinion of the other, it is better. However, when benefits involved in the conflict, we will be adamant in one's opinion, otherwise we lose. Then, we try to force the view with weapon. children call on other with cry. Adult call on other with violence. War is same as that. We can not eliminate those conflicts whereas we need to walk the road to peace that it is to understand each other."
NBE05824,"I think there are too many things to consider when it comes to who deserves to get the Nobel Prize, who choose it, how they decide and how you pick one if there are two similar situations and so on. But I think Nobel Prize should be given to those who Alfred Nobel would give to. And it is the people who works for disarmament and against militarism, and those who builds a peace movement. It is ironic that Barack Obama won the Nobel prize in 2009 and he was ultimately responsible for the recent bombing in Afghanistan. That attack led to the deaths of 22 people at a hospital run by MSF which happened to win the prize in 1999. And the fact that Henry Kissinger won the Nobel prize is something hard to understand. I know it is nearly impossible to make one conclusion that everyones agree. but as I said there are a lot to think about."
NBE06157,"I strongly agree with your idea. I also think doubt whether winners make a contribution to world ""real"" peace or not. I think the Norwegian Nobel Committee has to have a rethink about who is awarded Nobel Peace Prize or how select the Nobel Peace Prize winner. In addition to this, if Nobel Peace Prize winner committed to peace after he or she award Nobel Peace Prize, the Norwegian Nobel Committee would have to deprive it. Of course, I hope Nobel Peace Prize winners don't commit to ""real"" peace and are willing to contribute a lot of things to it."
NBE07017,I disagree with your comment because you can't rightly see accomplishment of the Nobel Peace Prize winners. It is true that they also did bad thing. . . so . . . as other people. They are people. We are people. So their doing bad action is usual as we do bad action. However their accomplishments are so big. They truly change the world. This accomplishment should be praised by world's people. Therefore the Nobel Peace Prize is necessary for us.
NBE05929,"I agree with your idea. The other day I saw the same new of this article . There are written Terrorism occur one after another, and unemployment rate is high. So I also think strange that there is a wide gap between Tunisian National dialog Quartet and citizens, so I disagree this Nobel Peace Prize."
NBE05578,"I see your point, but I am of the opinion that at first glance it may seem to those of just a name only, it is worth. This is because Nobel Prize has authority. Nobel Prize is a global award that began in 1901 in accordance with the will of Alfred Nobel, known as dynamite inventor. It is a prize that honors that has been established in the hope of to lasting peace. Attention to the Nobel Prize is very high. In many countries it will be broadcasting the scene of ceremony through the mass media such as television. Furthermore winner of Nobel Prize will be celebrations by all over the country. 100 years ahead is resting name in textbooks of history also is about your name is known throughout. It is true that Nobel peace prize may be awarded to the leader of the dissident under tyranny, it is common to receive a backlash from the government of the winners of the country. This might also be cause given rise to conflicts between nations. But if we use this authority in the right direction and will stand in the role in terms of the aim of lasting peace."
NBE07068,"I am agree with you. The Nobel Peace Prize should be given to the person who did his/her best to make peace. I also don't understand why Barack Obama was given the Nobel Peace Prize. He did only speech twice for disarmament. The United State still dispatches a soldier to the various places. The armament may be the things which are important to get an international position as China and USA are making a strong effort on military affairs. But The Prize should be given to really peaceful people, such as Mother Teresa. She was active for poor people devotedly for a long time. The world will accept the receiving a prize of the person like her."
NBE07288,"I agree with your opinion. Your comment is so great. First, the awarding system of Nobel Prize have to be considered many times. And people in Japan have to notice the peace is rare."
NBE05693,"I agree with your opinion. To be honest, I don't know the real situation of Tunisia, but when I know that gap between Tunisian National dialog Quartet and citizens, I am very sorry for Tunisian people because they may feel complex rather than happy. I learn that it is important not to see the event from one aspect and not only winner of the Noble Peace Prize but also giver of that has responsible for each other."
NBE06195,"Hearing the article, the article idea is the same to my idea. There are six Nobel Prize, but I think Nobel peace prize don't need only. I have three reasons supporting my opinion. Firstly, ""peace"" is ambiguity. People say that peace is not to break out wars. If people's idea is true, cold war age will be very peaceful age because there is not world war. So, we should establish unclear Nobel peace prize. In addition, Norway use Nobel peace prize for politics. For example, when EU awarded Nobel peace prize, EU had dangerous breaking. Norway gave Nobel peace prize to EU for breaking. It is not good for Nobel Prize. Finally, the most important reason is that parson who shouldn't get Nobel peace prize can get Nobel peace prize. In the past, people inducing wars got Nobel peace prize. For example, Hitler and so on. It is better to be banned Nobel peace prize than they get Nobel peace prize. All in all, I think that Nobel peace prize don't need for our society. Things we need is not Nobel peace prize but hurts of seeking peace."
NBE06196,"I agree with your opinion. I think that Nobel peace prize don't need. There are a parson making wars break out, a human agreeing with violence and people do nothing for peace in Nobel peace prize winners. Why did they get Nobel peace prize? One reason is that Norway uses Nobel peace prize for politics. Giving Nobel peace prize, Norway gets winner's good inspection and helps not only winner's good action but winner's bad action. So, Hitler began World War 2 and Obama restarted violence named ""fighting against terrorism"". Second reason is that there is Nobel peace prize every year. Originally, there is never a great parson or a great organization for peace every year. Otherwise, Nobel peace prize winner is announced every year. So, quality of Nobel peace prize winner is decreasing. In the other words, Nobel peace prize is got no value. Before saying, I think that neutral organization should decide Nobel peace prize winner and Nobel peace prize winner is chosen every 4 years. If Nobel peace prize changes my idea, Nobel peace prize will return the most valuable prize all over the world in future."
NBE05961,When I read this article and knew that almost all the Nobel peace prize winners are not justified according Nobel's wish I was surprised and very shocked. And the nobleness of the Noble peace prize is decreasing and becoming the prize only in name. To regain the nobleness I think that the Nobel committee should take it seriously and think who to award the prize carefully enough. Many people all over the world want the Noble peace prize to be more respectable. Someday I want to win the Nobel peace prize
NBE05960,"I totally agree with you. I was shocked to read this article. Some people who won the Nobel peace prize was concern with wars. This fact means that they are at the other end of the spectrum. I am not able to respect these people. Your idea that the criterion should be clearer to make it better is a good idea. I don't want such people, for example, Obama, Kissinger to be winners of the award from now on too."
NBE05959,I think so too. I also had been thinking that the Nobel peace prize was always award to people who were respected by all the people and who kept on doing peaceful active to the end of their lives. I think that the selection of the Nobel peace prize winner should be improved. However the difficulty of the selection of the Nobel peace prize is that the winner who we think is suitable can do violent actions. When the Barack Obama won the Nobel peace prize I was thinking that he is peaceful person and he is proper to the prize. But after that he decided the US drop bombs in Afghanistan
NBE05958,"I agree with you. To select the Nobel peace prize is a very difficult problem. There are little distinction between peace and war. We cannot say some who ended the war is the peaceful person and vice versa. Many people were killed by the bombing in Afghanistan and it was decided by the Nobel peace prize winner, Barack Obama by the name of justice. As you say we have to pay attention to the occurrence in the background of the receiving it and the later incident."
NBE06048,"I agree with you and I think so, too. The Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded with result of genuine peace. Even if somebody fought for his peace and became a hero, if he murdered the partner who fought, not only he is a hero, but also is a murderous fiend. And more a new fight may be born by suppressed hatred. Can we call this true peace? I do not think so at all. So the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded from a fair viewpoint."
NBE05694,"I was very surprised that Alfred Nobel who is the founder of Nobel Peace Prize was the inventor of dynamite and made his fortune as an arms manufacturer. I did not know this fact before, but I felt confident that the founder of Nobel Peace Prize was the person who accomplished or engaged in some peace movement. It is Fredrik Heffermehl, the author of a biography on Nobel, who decided to give this prize to the people working for disarmament and against militarism, and building a peace movement. Furthermore, Hitler and Stalin who were notorious in history also nominated for this prize. I realize from these fact that justice is not stable or universal, and easy to change by age. Although they are criticized now for their way of politics, they must be heroes in their own country at that time. And the Noble Peace Prize has one problem. That is the winners need not give it back if they do unpeaceful action. For instance, Barack Obama, who is awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 is ultimately responsible for US bombing in Afghanistan. I think the Nobel Peace Prize is very awkward from origin - and until now."
NBE06712,"I think Obama is worth to get Nobel Prize because he got it. I mean, it was not a Prize for the past result, it was for the expectation for the future."
NBE06197,"I disagree with your opinion. To begin with, I think that Nobel peace prize don't need. There are a parson making wars break out, a human agreeing with violence and people do nothing for peace in Nobel peace prize winners. Why did they get Nobel peace prize? One reason is that Norway uses Nobel peace prize for politics. Giving Nobel peace prize, Norway gets winner's good inspection and helps not only winner's good action but winner's bad action. So, Hitler began World War 2 and Obama restarted violence named ""fighting against terrorism"". Second reason is that there is Nobel peace prize every year. Originally, there is never a great parson or a great organization for peace every year. Otherwise, Nobel peace prize winner is announced every year. So, quality of Nobel peace prize winner is decreasing. In the other words, Nobel peace prize is got no value. Before saying, I think that neutral organization should decide Nobel peace prize winner and Nobel peace prize winner is chosen every 4 years. If Nobel peace prize changes my idea, Nobel peace prize will return the most valuable prize all over the world in future."
NBE06075,"The Nobel prize for peace has long history of nominating and granting awards to individuals who does not fit the criteria and Alfred Nobel's idea of peace. The secretive committee has nominated Stalin and even Hitler in the past. Recent winner, Barack Obama won the prize after being nominated for less than two weeks in office has also called a controversy. Barrack Obama is also responsible for the recent bombing in Afghanistan, in other words does not fit the model of peace that Alfred Nobel wishes which is disarmament and against militarism. In my opinion Nobel prize for peace should not be a model for peace efforts and people should not take Nobel prize for peace seriously. The prize itself has always been subject for controversies and the committee is very secretive. And most importantly Alfred Nobel, the man behind Nobel prize himself is the founder of dynamites which is violently used in wars. In my opinion the concept of the Nobel peace prize itself is a joke and probably was made to clean Alfred Nobel's image as an armament manufacturer."
NBE07102,"My first word will be ""disappointed"" and the first feeling when I read this news is ""disappointed"" too. I was completely shocked by this article. I felt disappointed because I felt like being betrayed by a reliable source of information. Which means that I felt like my entire past has been denied or vanished. My dream is to receive a Nobel Prize in Japan when I was a child and I am pretty sure that many people had the same dream as myself when they were children. To receive a Nobel Prize is like the ultimate goal to pursue or to dream about for many people from different countries. There nothing about race, tradition or background difference involved in there, people from all over the world have dreamed about receiving it. Moreover, Nobel Peace Prize is the most famous one in the Nobel Prizes. There are varieties of Nobel Prize, for example, about chemistry, literacy, physics and so on. As I said, I was extremely disappointed when I first saw this article. I was completely faked. I did not doubt for a moment about reliably of Nobel Prize. I did not doubt for a moment about that Nobel Peace Prize could be mistaken to give. However, I am also relieved a bit because I did not want to get cheated for my entire life. I wanted to the truth and the truth is not always crystal clear. The truth could be gray or cruel. Which makes the life exciting and beautiful."
NBE06680,"I agree with you. And you are great to search more by yourself. I do not understand what the purpose of the Nobel Peace Prize. I do not know what contribution to peace some winners of Nobel Peace Prize did. There are some contradictions about Nobel Peace Prize between a real and an ideal. Saying ultimately, I think Nobel Peace Prize do not need to continue. At least, I think you do not make a winner or winners of Nobel Peace Prize every year. I think the value of Nobel Peace Prize must be higher. If the value of Nobel Peace Prize is higher, the winner of Nobel Peace Prize is more famous and have more authority."
NBE06466,"I think so too. Nobel peace prize is very vague on election standard. This problem must be solved as soon as possible, and I hope that Nobel peace prize changed the valuable prize."
NBE07229,"Nobel peace prize winners should be people who are worth to be respected by many people in the world. I really agree with you at this point. But who is worth to be respected? Nobel Prize is given to someone every year. In this system, selection committee should find the person if they don't want to give anyone, because it is their profession. I think this tradition should be abandoned. If this prize lasts imperfectly, it is just a blasphemy to Nobel Prize. In Japan, there was a literary prize called ""Akutagawa Prize"". This Prize was said to be a gateway to success in the literary world in Japan. But in 2015, a comedian was given this prize. This made some of Japanese confused. Actually, comedian and novelist is similar type of profession in their work ""to make people laugh or happy with their technical use of words"". But the literature world and comedy world is different thing at all and should be distinguished clearly. It can be also seen as the tragedy caused by the profession to select prize winner every year. In Japan the literature world is going to the comedy level by selection committee. I think we should consider it again ""Who is deserve to winning a prize?""."
NBE06682,"It's difficult problem to solve. Indeed Nobel Peace Prize become a mere name, I think but it is great award."
NBE06429,"I disagree with your opinion. I do not know her opinion. I think it is great that there is a wide gap between Tunisian National dialog Quartet and citizens, so I agree this Nobel Peace Prize."
NBE05638,"The peace prize that should make people warm feeling came to virtually let many people hold a question, when I knew this news for the first time, I was sad. But the power to give people the feeling of courage and the peace by there being a prize for peace is true, so I agree with the the continuation of the peace prize. Among the Nobel Prizes, especially Nobel Peace prize and Nobel Prize in Literature, the person who is hard to think that should win it generally may win it. In particular, the conferment to a politician is a question. I think that it is difficult to evaluate the politics and the peace when some time has not passed. A selection reason is vague, and there are many opinions to doubt the significance of existence, but I think that it is not useless because it can give the world an opportunity to think about peace by giving a prize. It is very complicated to evaluate peace because the peace has various definitions and a lot of objects. Therefore I think that the prize for peace should not be send with an political atmosphere of the time easily otherwise it may become a not good prize. I think that it should commend it after a fixed period of time passes after the death of the person and the approximate evaluation of the person was decided if they confer a prize on a politician. Recent Nobel Peace prize has considerably political implication, so the selection that anyone can understand is becoming difficult. Not only appreciating the past results, but also it may be given to send a message in hope of influence after receiving a prize like the future political situation. The politicians who were awarded a prize in the past because of political consideration are Former Prime Minister Eisaku Sato, ex-President Kim Dae-Jung, ex-President Jimmy Carter, Mr. Albert Gore and President Obama. Peace and the justice are always unstable with vagueness. It has various values by being evaluated in a way of thinking, a viewpoint, and a situation. Based upon the foregoing, I think that it is understandable that a prize for peace has a pro and con. I think that the prize of the peace is more likely to be accepted willingly by many people without bringing about an argument if a rational judgment without deflection is done at a stage of the selection. As you say, I agree with the opinion the appropriate select criterion is necessary. The committee considers the significance that Nobel made this prize once again and I want it to be the blameless true peace prize."
NBE05053,"I agree with you. Before I read this article, I research for the terrorism in Tunisia. That hospital which is broken by American aerial bombing, which was the only place to solve the medical problems in that area. So, we cannot imagine how it gives a big damage of the people who live in that place. In this accident, many nurses and pharmacists and patients are dead. They lost not only the lives but also the important knowledge. I am really sorry for them. At the same time, I feel the deep anger in my heart. So, I agree with you from bottom of my heart."
NBE05316,"I have thought that Nobel peace prize was noble but according to this article, it may be wrong. Nobel peace prize was given to some people who did not active so peaceful. I think people who did violent or cruel thing like bombing should not be prized. It is little dangerous to select people to prize by only one surface. All behavior of the person should be considered, and then, they should be given the prize."
NBE05317,"I think your idea is better ways to Nobel peace prize. To build peaceful world, working for disarmament and against militarism is essential things. I think there are some people who activateded to build peace world but if they did extreme violent movement can not be given this peace prize. Little violent movement is needed to build peace world so some making violent movements have to be allowed but too cruel one or too many violent actives do not have to be allowed."
NBE07507,I agree with your point that Nobel prize includes individual thoughts. I think that make the differences of the value of each prize.
NBE05457,"I agree with your opinion. I also think that Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded when genuine peace occurred. Like in Tunisia, there is no true peace in the country. Thus, they should not be awarded for their movement."
NBE05692,"I agree with your opinion. Needless to say, the Nobel Peace Prize is great award which has long history. However, we should not forget that the Noble Peace Prize is made and operated by human."
NBE06617,"At first, I think about ""peace"" before you think about the Nobel Peace Prize. According to the Wikipedia in English, ""Peace is harmony between different social groups that is characterized by lack of violence or conflict behaviors, and the freedom from fear of violence. Commonly understood as the absence of hostility and retribution, peace also suggests sincere attempts at reconciliation, the existence of healthy or newly healed interpersonal or international relationships, prosperity in matters of social or economic welfare, the establishment of equality, and a working political order that serves the true interests of all. "" It define ""peace"" finely in the Wikipedia in English . Secondly, I think about ""Nobel Peace Prize"". According to the Wikipedia in Japanese, ""the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded to a person or organization that was the largest and best contribution for friendly relations between nations or reduction and abolition of armaments or holding peace conference"". However, these days, the members of selection committee seem have expand this definition. I can't understand some points. For example, ""reduction and abolition of armaments"". Do we think it lead the world to peace? Some countries will be attacked relentless from the enemy if they reduce the armaments easily. Such a vague definition is a factor of recent criticism. In particular, I think it is a quite problem to award the Nobel Peace Prize to politicians. Politics is for their country and even has likelihood to have a bad influence on foreign countries, for example, Henry Alfred Kissinger. In such a situation, we can't possibly realize ""peace"". In contrast, other Nobel Prize, in particular science, is easy to discuss. If a scientist get science make progress greatly, that's a good thing. I think the Nobel Peace Prize should be removed."
NBE07495,"I totally agree your opinion. we should focus on what he did rather than what he said. I also read the article which said secretary of nobel peace prize regrets that they gave nobel prize to Obama and said ""No Nobel Peace Prize ever elicited more attention than the 2009 prize to Barack Obama, "" we might should not blame what he did because as I wrote in my comment it is not everything what we saw, but it is definitely wrong that Obama got peace prize."
NBE05214,"I think that it is difficult to praise or to not praise the fact a little-known quartet of groups from Tunisia got the Nobel Prize. At first, I think it is so great that Tunisia became the democracy society, but I changed my opinion which praises Tunisia. The reason why is the reality of Tunisia is far from the democracy. I read a column written about this Tunisian revolution last week. It is named ""The process of Tunisian democratization. "" in Japanese. The author name is Keiko Takaki. In the column, I understand that Tunisian government really made effort to run democracy society. At first, the first election of Tunisia is thought to come to the failure by foreign countries, but it is different from their foresight. The voting rate was much higher than their foresight. I think that they can say that election was success, but I want to say the local situation is far from the democracy society. Public peace and order has been getting worse after the Tunisian Revolution. I have seen a lot of comments in the internet or columns or articles which shoes the nowadays getting worse of Tunisian public security. I think still now, it is not finished the process of becoming democracy society of Tunisia. Many people in this country feel unrelieved, because they do not imagine what would happen from now. I think it is necessary more time to be a real democracy society for Tunisia. In the pattern of Japan, it took some time to be a real democracy country. Our country have become an absolute monarchy once. Needless to say, Tunisia is the same to Japan, now the people still feel unrelieved, so it needs more time to be a real one. To sum up, I think it is too early for Tunisia to get the Nobel prize, because the local situation of Tunisia is far from democracy and people feel unrelieved."
NBE05156,"I almost agree with your opinion. But I do not think the result is all. I think the process which try to be world peace is also important. In terms of the point of the correct person who should be to receive the Nobel Prize, I agree with you. I also think some current winners of the Nobel Peace Prize are not suitable. Because they did not pursuit of world peace. In spite of not trying to be world peace, they received that Prize. As you said, many people hope the Nobel Peace Prize bring us true peace as you."
NBE05213,"I agree with you. I think it is too early for Tunisia to get the Nobel Prize. As you said, the local situation of Tunisia is not good. There is the gap between the upper side of Tunisia and local people. I think they should receive the Nobel Prize after the gap is getting smaller."
NBE06800,"I think this prize is not proper because indeed, there is a person damaged by war or weapon , but it ignore his situation. So, there was no room for the question in Nobel Peace prize until now , but I don't think that I can easily understand this prize."
NBE06618,"I don't agree with your opinion. I am also opposed to the Nobel Peace Prize. However, the reason isn't the winner is disturb the peace. Definition of peace is so ambiguous. There are situations when some people see the world is peaceful, other people see the world isn't peaceful in the world. For example, two organizations that conflict with war and civil war. I won't tolerate the presence of ISIL. However, ISIL think the world that they aim is peaceful. It is not a mistake of the people. Nobel Peace Prize is a presence that could destroy the values of such people. We should eliminate it right now."
NBE06799,"I disagree with you. It is true that the recent prize winner may be surely a person disturbing peace as you say . However, successive many prize winners are people who really made an effort for peace, and I think that they was appropriate people for Nobel Peace prize. In addition, it is to be incorrigible in anything that a personal opinion becomes available and is synonymous with it criticizing decision by majority to criticize it, and I think that they may decide nothing without individual thought."
NBE05478,"I often see a sentence ""the Arabian spring success"" when I check this news, may it be said that I really succeeded? I hear the dark news concerning Tunisia including the hotel surprise attack that happened in Bardot Museum surprise attack a half year ago, June consistently. A suicide bombing happens in Turkey of the east, and pains and the uneasiness of the civic life seem to be conveyed in Tunisia which should be excited by winning Nobel Prize. The distance to peace might go far more and more but I understood that circumstances of Tunisia were not so simple when I read articles well. I am common to the circumstances of the two countries at the point where the existence of the radicals tissue ""Islamic nation"" casts a gloomy shadow over. The unemployment rate of the youth is more than 40% in Tunisia. The Islamic nation combatant from Tunisia is that there is the most it probably because I am related to it if I watch it by approximately 3, 000 and country distinction. The youth who does not feel charm in accomplished democratization but it with much effort in Arabic spring flows out in the Islamic nation. It is a serious problem. It shows the sides different again of Nobel Peace prize when I think so. As few President Obama won the assumption of office room once, Nobel Peace prize seems to have possibilities to be sometimes given with expectation to future peace. Uneasiness is left in Tunisia, but surely still in comparison with Libya and Egypt makes the body of the democratic nation. I think that it is this Nobel Peace prize to expect authority pickles to be opposed to the Islamic nation at the same time to have evaluated it as a success example. The Tunisian government will be to have felt big pressure. I want not only to raise an idea, but also to show that the politics is possible."
NBE05343,"I cannot agree Nobel Peace Prize. Terrorism occur one after another, and unemployment rate is high. In other words, reality is far from democracy's success. think it is great that there is a wide gap between Tunisian National dialog Quartet and citizens, so I agree this Nobel Peace Prize."
NBE05479,"I understand your idea. I think it's good idea too. The value of the Nobel Prize will fall steadily if a person and the group which are not good for this prize win it. Also, the groups can move boldly and their ideas are in danger of being treated as pacifism by using the tittle of Nobel Peace Prize as you say. Nobel Peace Prize Committee should think the value of this Prize deeply and give to the most good person who fight to keep a peace. However, a lot of serious problems happen all over the world now including the problem of Islamic State and terrorism. I think that word in itself peace is in condition not to be able to easily give off it, and the weight of this prize will become bigger and bigger from now on. I will check the movement for a peace over the world. Many Japanese people don't think about a peace deeply."
NBE06798,"I agree with your opinion. i think Nobel Peace Prize is only for the name, now. Not the important thing receiving this prize, I think it that there is it whether they left achievement with this prize in the world."
NBE05081,"I agree with you. Your investment is so good. I think that Nobel peace prize has a little worth, so the prize is re consider many times."
NBE05082,I can't agree the prize. Other Nobel prize are clear why choose the person but peace prize is not. The news is clear case. I think the prize should be given a person that all people can agree.
NBE05988,"I think that it is a good thing for the citizens of Tunisia , a little-known quartet of groups from Tunisia were awarded the 96th Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in moving the North African country towards democracy. Tunisia has a serious problem of terrorism. I hope that this news become a chance, to solve the problem."
NBE06991,"When I read this article for the first time, I doubted the truthfulness of the article, and it was so surprising for me. I think ""joke"" candidates are bad for democracy because I can't feel their sincerity from their attitudes. Candidates can be national leaders whose role is to reflect public opinion in policy decisions. Certainly, what you wear is freedom and a form of self-expression. However it is natural for members of society to wear clothes appropriate to the occasion. In addition, they should watch their words and actions, especially the person who wants to be representative. As the above account suggests, I can't possibly leave politics which have a close connection with our lives. However, in the class, a student said"" Democracy is free not only for us but also for candidates, so it doesn't matter"". This didn't exist in my opinion, so it was interesting for me to come into contact with a different thought. I feel the importance of studying all together in the class again."
NBE07484,"I heard this news on TV at first. At that time, this story was reported as a joking matter. I did not take it seriously, but I became to think that we have to give this problem more carefully consideration after I read this article. We should not confuse democracy with joke candidates, such as Ukraine's Internet Party represented by the Sith Lord. It is certainly that democracy is fair and equal treatment of everyone in organization, and respects their right to take part in making decisions. However, we must not have the wrong idea of liberty. We should be discreet in liberty that is given in democracy, I think. At least, a candidate who is identified Star wars character should not be elected to the city council. Therefore, I think that ""joke"" candidates are not good for democracy. And then we have to make wholesome democracy."
NBE07020,"I saw this news on TV at first. At that time I can't understand what happened because I only saw chewbacca arrested by police and I thought people was arrested for only disguising costume of chewbacca because Ukraine police is spoilt. But I knew the truth is different from my conjecture when I read this news. Truly A man dressed as Chewbacca was arrested in Ukraine because he broke legislation that forbids campaigning. Candidates should reflect public opinion in policy decisions in order to protect democracy. But ""Chewbacca"" 's action is contrary to democracy. He insults many Ukrainians who hopes true democracy. I want him punished severely and I hope such people never appear."
NBE06990,"I agree with your opinion. Initially I only paid attention to the costume of the joke candidate because Chewbacca had a lot of visual impact for me. However you focused on his actions from beginning to end from the viewpoint of democracy which he should not break legislation, and it was so great. I also thought I want such people not to appear. I can't possibly leave politics which have a close connection with our lives."
NBE06989,"I agree with your opinion that a candidate who is identified Star Wars character should not be elected to the city council. When I read your opinion, I deepened my understanding about democracy because I couldn't reach the discussion which made reference to liberty. It is difficult to debate liberty, but I think this candidate has the wrong idea of liberty clearly. Therefore I respected you for being able to reach such a thought!!!"
NBE05791,"I think the accident in Ukraine have a big problem over our thought. First, they take part in political activities as the character of ""Star Wars"". They should enjoy with these at the party, shouldn't do in public space which decide the posture of government and nations. Second, the name recognition of these character is much bigger than any other participants, it cause a big effect to politics. It's a level that some people can let any person win the election. Actually, ""Palpatine"" have won the election. And also, in the accident of Chewbacca, It's funny that he reject a duty he must pay fine. To begin with, this accident prove that they are not suit to work in the political world. The Ukraine government should make an effort to protect their fairness and exclude this group. I hope these group don't appeared in our country."
NBE07320,"At first, I can't understand this news clearly. I've never seen ""Star Wars"", so those names mentioned in the article were strange to me, except for Darth Vader. It may be one of the reasons, but there is another bigger reason. I couldn't believe the fact that party candidates are dressed in character costumes and it is allowed. I think, in Japan, there is a tacit understanding that such a joke is not suitable for political situations. I've took it for granted, so it was difficult for me to imagine the situation which the article says. However, I don't think their style is wrong. Because it is people that are at the center of democracy, and it should be free how to express ourselves in a political situation. Recently, democracy is marked by increasing number of young people who are not interested in politics and the light poll in Japan. Those people such as Ukraine's Internet Party candidates attract attention, so their style may become one of the solutions to that problems. However, even though there will be a heavy vote thanks to ""joke"" candidates, it may be novelty, interest or love for the character, not policy itself declared by the party that encouraged citizens to vote. I think it is meaningless and not good thing. Furthermore, if a ""joke"" candidate put his heart into the role extremely, it will lead to a disturbance of the public order. ""Chewbacca"" in this article is a good example. In conclusion, freedom should be allowed in democracy, but, at the same time, there should be restriction to some extent. In addition, parties such as Internet Party must think of the political policies earnestly and we have to turn our eyes to them not only their eccentric appearances."
NBE06594,"I was surprised at this news. I wonder why Chewbacca who is Star Wars character was arrested. It is not prohibit that Chewbacca is engaged in political activity. However, he has a problem in the attitude toward political activity. ""as his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet"" When I read this sentence, I could hardly believe. Though he was fined $8 for breaking legislation that forbids campaigning on Election Day, he made a lame excuse. Moreover, he did not take off his costume though he was in the court. Such a person should not do a political campaign. A faithful person should go into politics. Even if he is elected, he will not be able to perform the proper political activity. We got the opportunity to think about politics through this article. We should have more interest in them."
NBE06772,"When I read this article first, I couldn't understand in detail, because I don't know StarWars character very much. But I know Chewbacca is a hairy creature in that picture, so I wonder why Chewbacca was arrested in Ukraine. I think ""joke"" candidates such as a man dressed as Chewbacca are not good for democracy. Certainly, I think candidates can wear some clothes which they like, it's free for everyone. But they should wear proper clothes for occasion. In addition, the candidates have responsibility to campaign for the election, so ""joke"" candidates should work seriously. I want all ""joke"" candidates will be punished and I hope all candidates will campaign for the election seriously and such a ""joke"" man will never appeared."
NBE06263,"At first, it was difficult for me to understand the whole story of this article because I have never watched the Star Wars and these names are unfamiliar to me. After I read this article, I felt that they should be sincere in voting the election. We should not act costume play like Halloween party at election. But, I have another idea that people would be interested in election because of their strange costume play. However, I disagree with such a costume play at election. Additionally, it may be free for all people to dress any style (I suppose it is not illegal to wear any costume), but people who dress such a costume should not cause trouble and commit law. I hope everyone should obey law and be sincere in voting the election."
NBE06861,"I laughed when I read the news and arrested man said ""as his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet. "" I can't understanding why he completely became Chewbacca and said these excuse. Also I was surprised at Darth Vader announced his candidacy for the mayor in Odessa. Democracy is in close connection with liberalistic and so, they have the right to put himself forward as a candidate for mayor as a Darth Vader(if the law permit) but I think if they have common practice, they didn't think up these foolish action. In the Democracy, we elect the leader by the elections and candidate's talent is very important for the mass people so if the candidate is fool, it is very dangerous situation for administration. I think we have to educate more politics thing especially in Japan."
NBE05613,"As I have never seen ""Star Wars"", this news was a little difficult for me. In this article, the story seems to be joking such as Chewbacca was arrested. . . , Darth Vader, etc. , but this situation is actually serious. Ukraine is a chaotic situation today. Last year, Russia took over the Crimean region which has belonged to Ukraine and the eastern parts of Ukraine have seen fighting between locals and Russian-supporting rebels. America and European Union did not cope with this situation properly. Russia is clearly dangerous, but no countries cannot impose heavy sanctions on Russia. In my opinion, the situation that Russia is a permanent member of the U. N. Security Council is ridiculous. If Japan becomes a permanent member of the Security Council, unless Russia lose their status, the situation will not change. Certainly, talking each other is important, but America and EU should give heavier sanctions on Russia."
NBE07455,"When I looked at this photo for the first time , I was very surprised at the photo . And, I can not help thinking about what was happening in Russia. After reading this news, I could not understand all information of this news, because I do not know characters of Star Wars at all. So I thought about this news from the point of election. It is true that by using the well known character, the candidate who uses it may be enough famous and he may be elected. It is a merit. But, it is also true that people who choose the candidate may not see his pledge. They may vote him as if they vote Star Wars character. If people vote him only seeing Star Wars character, it has no meanings of election. From the point of election, it should be done fairly, I think using character is not good."
NBE06433,"I don't know ""STAR WARS"". So, I cannot imagine the incident of this news, but there is what I want to tell you. I think that you must not hurt others for your hobby, and must not hurt public welfare for the hobby. Indeed, you may want to be immersed in a hobby. I have the same feeling. The time immersed in hobby is happiest, and a person is enriched. But even if there is such reason, you aren't supposed to hurt public welfare. When your hobby hurt public welfare, the conduct changes to a crime. you should not consider this fact easily. I think that it is after there is happiness of a person around, that a person can enjoy a hobby."
NBE05188,"My father has liked ""Star Wars"" since before I was born, so after I read this article, I told this news to him. Then he laughed, and I felt that the movie was really loved by people around the world. The excuse of this criminal was very humor but too contrive, so I think that his own excuse led himself to arrest. Also, remaking national statue into a Star Wars' character and identifying with the movie character was probably people's longing for the new world, I think. Without traditional dirty tactics such as voter-buying, spoiler candidates and backroom deals, this world might have already changed."
NBE05721,"I saw this news at first, I don't understand and I think this is a Star Wars Parade. But, this is important . this case shouldn't be joke. I think these"" joke"" candidate shouldn't be elected, because I don't feel these Star Wars candidate think for democracy seriously. Of course, candidate is guaranteed of a set right for example wearing and speech. But we shouldn't have a mistaken idea of freedom. They are mistaken, and break a rule, so they are arrested. They have a possibility of disturbing a fair election. I don't want to come into existence these misunderstanding groups in Japan. And Japan should teach importance of fairness of democracy and election."
NBE07172,"At first, I did not know what is Chewbacca, so I could not understand the topic and the picture of the article when I saw them. After I understood Chewbacca, I was confused even more. I think the tendency which people love the animation and movies such as Darth Vader is good. But according to this news, it advances in the bad direction. His excuse, ""as his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet. "" , is definitely no joking matter. We must not excuse by using the characters. Its act would become the insult about them. It is not true love. If we want to love them, we respect the character and should behave definitely."
NBE06127,"I was very surprised when I first read this article because I cannot imagine someone doing the same thing in Japan. I have never watched Star Wars before, but I know the name ""Darth Bader"", and the fact that this character is a very famous villain, so I could not stop laughing at the man. However, as I read this article a couple of times, I thought that this incident might not be something to make fun off. This incident was taken place in the Election Day. The Election Day is a date to decide which person to entrust the country. Therefore, nobody should cause such an incident that might seem foolish. It is not clear how this incident would affect the result of the election, but it is very extremely clear that people shouldn't do something that can affect the results. To sum up, I was very surprised that there are people around the world who does things that I can't even think of, but it was a good chance to recognize what a peaceful country Japan is."
NBE06229,"I didn't know about Chewbacca, and was very confused when I read the headline. Such joke candidates as Darth Vader cannot be democratic representative , I think. Nobody with common sense would agree that they can satisfy popular demand, or manage complicated political problems. Now we should think about what the democracy has to be, and how we can realize it. And we must say, at least, candidates from Star Wars is not the answer."
NBE07232,"The existence of official candidates uniquely dressed could be permissible because they are a kind of performer especially when they appear in front of us. To stand out by any means and attract people's interests is necessary to some extent. But in a word, this case is bad. To use STARWARS character is apparently improper for such place. Reading with Japanese sense of moral, this article is very surprising and strange. But I also think such candidates may be one of the symbols the confused situation Ukrainian is facing now."
NBE06161,"I was very surprised when I read this article. The reason is because Chewbacca was arrested. According to this article, he was arrested because he broke legislation that forbids campaigning on Election Day. However, I think that his arrest is attracted worldwide attention and it has become a very effective political activity. I appreciate the importance of propaganda in politics deeply. ""Although the news of the arrest was met with amusement online around the world, the reality of life for many Ukrainians is no joking matter. "" So, I have to pay attention to what Chewbacca do the next in order to save the life of the Ukrainian people."
NBE07485,"Thank you very much for your comment to my opinion. And I feel honored to be said that you respect me for being able to reach such a thought. However, I think that I have to understand about democracy and liberty more deeply. It is really difficult to debate on political issue like democracy or liberty, even if we talk in Japanese, I think. So, we should study not only English, but also social problems."
NBE07483,"After I read your comment, I agree with your comment. As I also have never seen ""Star Wars"" and I knew nothing but Darth Vader, at first, I wondered who was Chewbacca. In addition, it was hard for me to understand the situation that party candidates were dressed in character costumes and Star wars characters were elected to the city council. I do not think that such a situation is allowed in Japan, either. If anything, Japanese people will not pay any attention to a joke candidate like the Internet Party. I also think that freedom should be allowed in democracy, and we have to discriminate between liberty and freedom. And parties such as Internet Party should take action, using moderation."
NBE05251,"I was surprised at this news. I have not heard such a news in Japan, so when I first knew it, I could not understand what had happened. In my opinion, everyone who wants to participate in politics should obey the legislation, so his action is unforgivable. No one want to follow him even if he is elected. Perhaps some people become interested in him because of his costume, but it will not make true democracy. I think the man should have considered about his action more and more."
NBE05250,"I agree with you. I had thought that his action was bad for the country because of violation of legislation, but it is true that this incident attracted worldwide attention. I also want to watch carefully what Chewbacca will do next for the Ukrainian people."
NBE05413,"When I first read the headline, I was surprised and couldn't understand the meaning because ""Chewbacca"" isn't a human but a character of ""Star wars. "" At first, I read this story and thought it is a funny story because movie character was arrested and when he had to pay a small fine equivalent for $8 for the disturbance, he said he couldn't pay ""as his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet. "" However, after I read this article many times, I think this is a serious problem. I think he would like to appeal to public for something, so he dressed as Chewbacca and took action like this. This incident also reflect the social problem in the world. As for his action, I think it is not good because people wouldn't like to vote these character. It sounds like joke. The election should be fair and serious. After the election, someone who elected ought to have a responsibility and lead people. So I think 'joke' candidate is not good for democracy. I would like to focus on his future action."
NBE05412,"I think your idea is right. His action sounds like joke even if he had rationale opinion. From these story, we can reconsider the social problem, so I would like to focus on this future story."
NBE05184,"After I reread this article in today's class, I thought about whether ""joke"" candidates are good or bad for election. I had first thought that such a candidate was not serious about election. However, one of such candidates Vitali Klitschko, who identified as one of Star Wars characters, was elected mayor by majority. Now election all over the world has difficulty in attracting civil attention, in particular, young people's ones. That's why I think that the pleasant campaigning of election is effective in people who are not interested in election coming to it. Election should become more appealing for all people, I think."
NBE05186,"I agree with your opinion. I think that the funny campaigning of election is very effective in attracting civil attention. Now, in particular, young people are not interested in election. That is very serious problem, so the form of the campaigning should be changed to solve it, I think. In addition, I also learned that propaganda was very important for candidates. For many Ukrainians, the incident is no joking matter, so I expect what he will act to save the life of the Ukrainian people next, too."
NBE05107,"At the beginning, I could not understand what the title means. However, reading the content of the article, I was able to know it and had mixed feelings. This time, a man became Chewbacca which is the character on Election Day. This is very interesting, but not correct as to the election. The man should have thought his own behavior more, I think. This is because ordinary people do not follow such a stupid man. I suppose the election is strict, so I want candidates to do right conduct."
NBE06830,"At first, I can't understand what the article said, because I don't know Star Wars. However, I think that joke candidates like him are not suitable for elections and we should consider the selection when we join it. We can vote next year, so we must judge whether the person I elect is suitable or not and have responsibility for the election. As do so, democracy is stranded up."
NBE05276,"When I read this news story for the first time, I couldn't understand the meaning. And I confused. Because, I did not know that ""Chewbacca"" is real or a character. After I understood this meaning, I thought this story is very funny. Because, The Wookiee', the man dressed as Chewbacca, is very crazy. I winder why he did these crazy things. And I think it is funny that the artist turned the statue of Lenin into Darth Vader. I wonder why Internet Party which has candidates who dressed as movie character exist. And I thought it is very funny that ""the Wookiee"" told local reporters he could not pay as his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet"" And I was surprised that the world heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko was re-elected mayor with 54 percent of the vote, defeating Aleksander Borovik. In Japan, some famous people and sport player became a member of the Diet. For example, Inoki who was a professional wrestler is one of a member of the Diet. In this news story, ""Borovik reported on Facebook. . . "" is written. I was surprised those people use SNS to insist their opinion."
NBE05275,"Me too. I also could not understand the meaning, when I first read this headline. Because I was confused that ""Chewbacca"" is real or movie character. I think your opinion - he would like to appeal to public for something - is interesting. After I read your comment, I think so too. If this opinion is right, he is not nice. The election should be serious. Because the election is the thing that decide this county's future. If he wants to appeal his policy, he play fair without dressing movie character."
NBE06746,"When I read this news, I was surprised and incomprehensible. I didn't know character of Star Wars so I can't understand Chewbacca. But I read carefully and I understood it. It's that this accident is serious problem. We have to think about how we should do election."
NBE05580,"When I read the news that a man dressed as Chewbacca was arrested in Ukraine on Sunday after he broke legislation that forbids campaigning on Election Day, I am very surprised. This is because I do not know there is the legislation that forbids campaigning on Election Day. I have not watched the movie of ""Star Wars"" yet. I wanted to watch this movie to read this news. I am sure that Chewbacca is the very important character in the story. He may save the peace of space."
NBE05551,"When I read this article, I was very surprised because I have never heard that politician dressed in costume of anime character like Chewbacca. I can't believe the politician behave like that. I think the politician is serious and it's way of thinking is hard. So I found his action a bit interesting. His action may break the stereotype for politics in Japan. But, in this time, the problem is that his action broke legislation that forbidden on campaigning on Election day. The idea was good, but we should conserve the law. And also, his excuse was terrible. ""My funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet. ""Children can understand it is a lie. Even if we want to do the remarkable action, I think we should obey law as an adult. On the other hand, the image of politics should be improve. In Japan, it has been said that the decline of voting rate becomes the problem. The main reason is that young people aren't interested in politics. I think the unique way of campaign is good as long as it dose not break legislation."
NBE05550,"I think that his attitude toward politics was bad. In addition, his stupid excuse was really unbelievable. He did a thing that he should not do as a politician, as an adult. Even if he want to campaign in unique way, he should've conserve the law. However, this evidence may attract young people who has been interested in politics. When I read this article, I imagine d if the situation happened. Young people in Japan may come to concern about politics, and the low voting rate may be improved."
NBE05185,"I agree with your feeling. I could not also believe this article when I read it for the first time. In addition, I thought that the joke candidates would attract young people at first, but on second thoughts, candidates can become national leaders, so I think the citizens cannot rely on such a candidate. For attracting young people to elections, I think it is wrong to make a joke and get votes. After all, if the joking candidate will be elected, young people would lose interest right away, and other citizens would not go along with him or her easily."
NBE07321,"I don't agree with your opinion that the candidates are fool and it is extremely clear that people shouldn't do something that can affect the results. Just like a party expresses itself for votes by holding up own campaign agenda and making a canvass of a neighborhood freely in democracy, I think a use of character costumes is also one of the way to do so. Although you say it was a good chance to recognize what a peaceful country Japan is, I don't think that existence of such candidates means Ukraine is not peaceful country. However, if the motivation for the joke style is not relevant to the politics, I can't support the party. They should have their own political intentions."
NBE05216,"I think that this news is regrettable for three reasons. Firstly, I don't understand why they changed their name only for the election? I think that it is not necessary to change their name related to Star Wars for politics. Second, it is indicated that the confusion of Ukrainian politics. Nothing to say, there are many politic scandals in Japan, but I think that I have never heard that politicians really change their name into character's name. Badly, the name Chewbacca and Darth Vader are too known to all over the world, so this news became the topic. Finally, it is no symptoms to solve this political confusion in Ukraine. To sum up, I hope that this kind of scandals won't happen again."
NBE07203,"I think a man being a candidate as Darth Vader has a good sense of humor, so the Chewbacca is. It can be possible when the election is in Russia, moreover, outside of Japan seen from the point of view of Japanese citizen. We see the generosity in them, but when it comes to politics, we have to ponder to whom we vote, since it directly relates to our lives. What improves our quality of life is the government but the same as who ruin it. To add, what is funny is that the fine is just $8, and he pursued his characteristics that he's from Star Wars, saying "" his bank has no branches on this planet""."
NBE07357,"I was surprised with this news and I just cannot accept such a joking candidate. Even though it seems the candidate attracts attentions from a lot of people, I think they can be generous only because it is other people's affairs. If a candidate in my own city or country begins saying such things, I strongly reject. I do not want him to represent us. If he wins the election and becomes the president, I do not think any other organizations will trust him. I want more people to take this news seriously and report this carefully. When people think this matter more, there will be a lot of different opinions to discuss and in that way, more people will be interested in political matters."
NBE06529,"When I read this article at first, I was very surprised. I think amusements mustn't come into the politics. If the representative of the Ukraine's Internet Party wearing Darth Vader or Emperor Palpatine get himself out of the costume, will the citizen agree with and give support to him? Probably, he would be not able to receive attentions because the popularity of him will depend on the looks which are very famous characters' largely. Also, in Japan such a thing appear recently. For example, Higashikokubaru Hideo who was the governor of Miyazaki prefecture and Tani Ryoko who is a member of the Diet. I consider that they won an election thanks to their name recognitions, that is to say, if the citizens had not known about them at all and watch them for the first time in the election, they may be not elected to the political job. Therefore, the name recognition is very dangerous in the election. It deranges our right thinking. We must pay attention to not its looks but content of the policy. Not only such a thing, candidates should avoid dirty tactics. Nevertheless the resignation of the former president after Euromaidan revolution, close ties with Russia wasn't dissolved in the last election. This means the election didn't reflect popular willingness and there were frauds. I want politicians to be honest and to work hard to make their own countries better. The politics which contradict citizen's assertions don't mean anything. I wish the style of Ukrainian politics is improved without further delay. Politics must be conducted seriously because it decides the future of countries. Of course, the conductor of politics must be elected seriously, too. Thus, using own name value or dirty tactics are politically incorrect and we must take care of them."
NBE05908,"This news story is related to an argument about running for the mayor under the false name. The advantage of this is that the citizens can feel close to the election. Due to a familiar name, they get interested in the election, and read a manifesto. This will be connected with a lively democracy. In other hand, such an action lacks sincerity. originally, politics should be sacredness because politics affects our way of life. Are you sure that such an action is permitted? I think that it should not be permitted. We vote for the person whom we want to trust, so a candidate must show who himself or herself is openly. Name is important when we evaluate them. Certainly, there are some statement who use false name in Japan (for example, Mr. Antonio Inoki). But they acted under the name, and are famous for the name, so their name remind of himself or herself. In this news story, we cannot recognize him in ""Chewbacca"", so he should not use the false name."
NBE05158,"I think the reason why such as Chewbacca appeared in campaigning on election day, the symbol of people's anxiety. People of Ukrainian have big doubt to their politics. In the last paragraph, in this news, the local elections were written as an unreliable thing because of traditional dirty tactics such as voter-buying, spoiler candidates and backroom deals. It seem difficult for me Ukrainian government to recreate new reliable politics. But they must introduce ""really reliable politics"" for people in Ukrainian. They are afraid of their politics. If the government does not try and success to introduce new politics, they cause a revolution again for their dissatisfaction of politics. The government should try to hold fair election and people choose appropriate and reliable man as a mayor who can have a power to change their politics."
NBE05480,"I agree your opinion. As you say, the action of a man dresses as Chewbacca is contrary to democracy. It's important for nations that candidates reflect public opinion in policy decisions in order to protect democracy."
NBE05755,"I was surprised that such a thing had been happened in reality. When I saw the picture first, I think why the character of Star Wars is there. It's interesting. But, I can't agree with them. It's politically exploit the popularity of Star Wars if it is not a joke. The most problem is that there are many people who had voted for them. However, recently, voter turnout has decreased. So, it might be good to collect the interest. For democracy, it is not allowed to be indifferent. Soon we become to be able to vote from the age of 18 in Japan. We should think the way to vote and politics."
NBE05667,"I read this news. First I thought that the Ukrainian is very unique country. Recent days, Star Wars is very trendy movie. But I did not watch the Star Wars, so I did not understand all of this news. However, I know Sith and Darth Vader or etc. . . So I was easy to read. It is news handled as a comedy in the world, but I think that it is serious news. The Ukrainian resists the government. They did repulsion to the living government. But I think that their idea is very interesting. It becomes the news by all means. If I attract attention, I will do a method similar to them. However, we must not be arrested. As a result, would their action be right? I was not able to win in the election for mayor, may there not be a meaning? I think that it is enough just to have been able to show intention to object to the present government in the world."
NBE06347,"The first point. I heard this news on TV at first, I cannot believe and was laugh. ""Wow there are a lot of people all over the world, but like this political party may be not bad . ""I thought at that time. But, if Japan has such a political party, what do I think? I think that I can't trust such a political party. Why? Because such a political party people do think about our nation?! I think that they think their own way. For example, their entertainment or amusement. Who can depend on our nation such a political party's candidate? I can't depend on them. The second point, He did not pay funds. It's only 8 dollars. He broke legislation that forbids campaign, but even so he refused to pay funds. Though imperfect , he is a nation 's representative , in good faith he should pay. But No! Faith! He broke legislation so he should pay! Nevertheless he did not have money because his bank does not exist on earth. I can't believe!"
NBE05668,"When you read this article, you were surprised. When I read this article, I felt surprised and I laughed. I did not know star wars, so I did not know Chewbacca. I was surprised when there was a person dressed in the clothes that it was strange in the world. But, they would want to tell. In fact they attracted attention of the world. Everybody gives an example of the Japanese Government. In this way, they gave the opportunity when we thought about politics. I regret that he was caught by the police. But, I think that they had a big influence on the world."
NBE06503,"Because I had never watched Star Wards before when I first read this article, I wasn't able to understand what was happening. But, I was interested in Star Wards and watched all series because the new movie was released last month. I thought it was very strange that Chewbacca was allegedly campaigning for Darth Vader and was thrown over a police car and handcuffed after knowing the characters of Star Wards. This news is related with democracy. Freedom of expression and speech is certainly the foundation of democracy. It is free that Ukraine's Internet Party runs for mayor on the topic of Star Wars. However, I think their actions are nothing but a publicity stunt aimed the election. Candidates should mind their minimum manner in public and never forget be representative of citizen. They misunderstand the true meaning of democracy. I want person who carrying out their responsibility as representative of citizen to go into politics."
NBE06023,"When I read this article I thought this is fiction for campaigning for election or movie. Because Star Wars has been popular in the world, and Star Wars sequel will be published next year. So I thought the movie production attempt a plan that election and movie advertisement go to the world. But it is nonfiction. I was so surprised. The man in the Chewbacca was arrested on suspicion of election law violations. He was shouting and rampaged. It is not allowed. His bad action becomes annoying to the Star Wars production company. But I think it is not bad to join to election even if somebody participates in the cosplay. Because it can be opportunity people who are not interest in their county election are actively participate in them. But this time is not good way for expression. Do not be never become a nuisance. This happen can be not imagined in Japan. May be Japanese is said to shy. But Japanese is not interest in own country elections. It is say numbers. Last election voter turnout is under 60%. It is not high, even compared with the global. If we want to say to Japanese government, we have to express in the election before movement."
NBE06917,"I think we shouldn't think of this news optimistically. That's because I think an election doesn't need jokes and tricks. In the case of Ukraine, A joke which a candidate in Ukraine Internet Party is Darth Vader might have a harmful influence for voters in Odessa. Why we choose a candidate in election? To realize democracy, peace and an ideal society, we listen to their speech and inquire into their election promises closely and finally are convinced that he (or she) is the best man to realize them. I'm awfully sorry that a superficial judge such as electing the candidate for the interest having nothing to do with an election (it means ""Star Wars"" in this news) will affect the political situation and we shouldn't simply laugh it off. In related example, I can image that famous candidates such former athletes and entertainer tend to be elected in an Upper House election in Japan. Although all the famous candidates who are elected don't have politic ability, they are elected for their popularity and carriers. It cannot be said that this tendency of Japan is the same as this news of Ukraine unconditionally. But I want to choose a candidate by knowing their potential. And I think serious choice lead to better politics. Nowadays, Ukraine is one of the countries having political unrest. It is necessary to work hard to establish the political system of Ukraine as early as possible. So they should seriously think about Ukraine ahead of joking. We shouldn't feel that it was no concern of mine. Can we think of our country sincerely? We need to study this news."
NBE07425,"My first impression of reading this article is funny. I like star wars and love Chewbacca. His cute voice and act makes me laughing. But, this is the first impression. After I read this article, I thought it is not simply and funny problem. The party candidates change into the funny costume. I cannot believe it. The candidates represent his region at the meeting and they should be good models of citizens. We Japanese have nothing to do with this problem in Ukraine. However, I think we need to think it seriously. Maybe this is a big problem for Ukrainian. After a man dressed as Chewbacca was arrested, he said, ""as my funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet. "" I think this comment is so funny, but this means he slighted the official election and democracy. So, people in Ukraine should not permit him and dismiss from his job. Many Ukrainians hope for a cleaner form of democracy. This act was contrary to their expectations. Now Ukraine has so many problems, but these people's act makes bad inside the country. I hope the government of Ukraine will manage the committee and the election strictly."
NBE06915,"I agree with your opinion. In this news, I was interested in being relation to democracy. I have wondered what democracy is for many years. That's because I don't think democracy is equal to liberty. And when I read this news, I thought of my opinion again. A candidate dressed the costume ""Chewbacca"" was arrested by Ukraine police and the cause of the arrest was that he was campaigning for Darth Vader. We could find Ukraine police judged even if democracy get spread of in the country, it don't mean people can express anything in public situation. Like your opinion, I also think the police's judge was good. In election, candidates should behave suitably to express their true motive without jokes. I think we should reflect on democracy."
NBE06916,"I also have never seen the series of ""Star Wars"". So I didn't understand the relation between Chewbacca and Darth Vader. So when I read the topic sentence at first, this news is funny too. But like your opinion, I think it shouldn't be news handled as a comedy. After we know this news, we have to reflect how we misunderstand about democracy. Anyway, I am interested in your opinion"" If I attract attention, I will do a method similar to them. . . . "" In my opinion, there was not the sympathy about the Ukrainian repulsion to the government. I think their styles of expression are illegal in term of a public election. But after I read your opinion, I reconsidered it a little. Certainly, if they were convinced of a defeat in normal method, I can understand they struggled to won for becoming a mayor in the style. We have to think of this news with taking into consideration of Ukrainian minds not only a law."
NBE07426,"Your opinion is so funny. Why do you watch the Star Wars? I think this is a greatest movie of all movies of science fiction. At first, I felt this article is so interesting, too. But, it is not so simply. People who were related politics should be in earnest. I think people in Ukraine dislike that the candidates make fun of citizens. So, I think your opinion is right. This must not be permitted."
NBE06504,"I think so, too. At first, I also could not understand the whole story of this article because I had never watch the movies. I didn't know Chewbacca and Star Wars characters very much, of course. It is certainly free that candidates is dressed in any clothes. The candidates of Ukraine's Internet Party would be conspicuous. But, I think they should wear proper costume and work a prompt action as representative of citizen. If they want to win the election, they should make an appeal to public sentiment for support in the proper way to express oneself. People who run for election should comply with the low, of course. I want candidates not to cause these trouble!"
NBE06562,"This news was very strange for me. When I read this article for the first time, I could not realize the contents because I did not know about Star Wars so much. I thought what Chewbacca and Wookiee were. The reason why he did not pay a small fine was unique. He really kept the world view of Star Wars. But, Ukraine's Internet Party seems to fool around. I do not believe that those people were elected. Such a matter will not occur in Japan. If things go on like this, the confusion in Ukraine will continue. Ukrainian should elect proper politicians if they really want to solve national problem. And regional issues are very complicated to solve. Ukraine where is located between Europe and Russia is in a delicate position."
NBE06230,"I totally agree with you. Candidates like them might make light of their conducts' impact on the democratic society. The democracy where such fools that thinks nothing of their people thrive can only decay, not properly function. I suggest Ukrainian government punish the criminal candidates severely."
NBE06561,"I could not also believe it was an actual problem. As you said, the news related to Star Wars is very timely. Actually this news was spread on SNS. Maybe it became a good publicity for the latest work. But the man in Chewbacca should not do such a act. Moreover, he should properly pay the fine."
NBE06889,"I agree with you. I think a candidate who is identified a character shouldn't be elected to the city council. Everybody have right to statement freely, so democracy in itself isn't incorrect to protect their right. However, everything isn't allowed to do. If they hope to realize their thought, they should win the confidence. I think people tend to trust a person who always looks neat and tidy, so the candidate should have put on not costume of a character but suit, polo shirt, and so on. When I read this article in the class, I wasn't able to understand the content well, because in Japan, this activity rarely happens. However, I should understand it deeply, because the globalization is making steady progress, so it is necessary for me to comprehension the international situation in order to live through the present day."
NBE06948,"I sympathize with this article. The election is fair and is not surely the place that may joke. What I disguise myself as is outrageous. However, I think that it is a good thought to let interest in election of modern people unlike election leave that disguise as the character of the popular movie. advances in the present age, and the politician in the world adopts the opinion of the elderly person than the opinion of a youth carrying the coming future. This is because an elderly person sends big interest to election. It will let the interest of many people leave for the election to do the disguise of the character of a movie attracting support from a wide generation. The youth may go to the election more by doing it this way. Furthermore, the politician may raise the innovative thought that thought about future in the future to get the support of the youth by doing so it. This original strange thought can have possibilities to change the future of the country."
NBE07267,"When I heard this news, I felt that this article was funny and interesting by only photograph of a strange animal. But I could not understand this article's contents at first, because I did not know what was the Chewbacca and star wars in detail. After that I was told by my group mate about star wars and what was the Chewbacca, I could understand this news' contents easily and I thought it is not simply and funny problem. And I was very surprised, because I have never seen such an accident in Japan, so someone may think he was very unique first, but I think that this accident is serious problem. We have to think about how we should do election and we should think how not to happen such a terrible accident any more. And candidates should mind their minimum manner in public and never forget be representative of citizen. They misunderstand the true meaning of democracy. I wish people who carrying out their responsibility as representative of citizen to go into politics."
NBE06771,"I agree with your opinion. And I also could not understand the whole story of this article. When I was a child, I have watched only Star Wars episode 1, but I forgot the character and the story. I think that joke candidate should not be elected and punished seriously because candidates should wear proper clothes for occasion and have responsibility to campaign for the election."
NBE06346,"I agree with your opinion. First, I have never seen ""Star Wars ""series. So I can not understand this news in detail. But those movies are very famous so I read this article, I want to watch ""Star Wars ""before. And I am interested in this news and movie. Second this country, Ukrainian is funny country. But such problem is serious . Not only funny but also serious . But I think that they enjoy doing such things, because he didn't pay a fine by the reason of stupid. If they want to win the election , he (or they ) should admits himself. Certainly, if the political party is comics or movies characters , I am interested in this political party. But if the political party does not what they should do, I may be losing the interest and think that do not playfully."
NBE05881,"At first sight, I was very surprised at the article for its strangeness. (Few days ago, the Star Wars movie was released, and this news will attracts the world's attention again. ) And many other people might also be thought it unique and as a kind of joke. And the news of the statue which was transformed into the Darth Vader is also very surprising and strange. But these joking candidates are not so bad, because due to them, people around the world started to focus on the political matter of Ukraine. Though this situation might become temporary, this is true that these joking candidates led to the improvement of social awareness. Of course, they are not appropriate for public election. But everyone knows the ordinary fact and will not elect them for real. So they do not harm seriously to the election, I think. At least, only in the respect of social awareness, (and apart from the reality, ) they may not be simply suppressed."
NBE05931,"I saw this news at first, I was surprised by picture . Also I could not understand that 'Chewbacca arrested in Ukraine after breaking election rules' and what Chewbacca is because I did not see the Star Wars. But when I went on reading this news , gradually I understood this article. I think that this is very serious. We have to think about how we should do election ."
NBE06378,"This idea which is the disguising themselves as characters of the movie is unique and so interesting, because I think that this idea is able to give an impact to many people. I also got a strong impact when I saw their appearance on TV news, and I think that is good idea, because they can get attention easily. In addition, people might be feel strong affinities easily with them. However, Chewbacca should not make an excuse because of the setting of the movie if he breaks the law. I thought this behavior is a conduct that a candidate of the election should not engage in and he accepts defeat with a bad grace. In that case, he can give an only bad impression to people. This political party has to turn over a new leaf if it wants to improve the impression of the citizens."
NBE06651,"At first, I can't get understand this news clearly. I haven't seen ""Star Wars"" ever, so those names mentioned in this article were odd to me, except Darth Vader. It may be one of the reasons, but there is another stronger reason. I couldn't believe the fact that party candidates are costumed in character costumes and it is allowed. In Japan, I think there is a tacit understanding that such jokes are not suitable for political situations. I have taken it for granted, so it was difficult for me to imagine the situation which this article mentions. However, I don't think their style is incorrect. Because it is people that are at the center of democracy, and it should be free how to express ourselves in a political situation. Democracy is marked by increasing number of young people who are not interested in politics and the light poll in Japan recently. Those people such as Ukraine's Internet Party candidates attract attention, so their style may become one of the solutions to that problems. However, even though there will be a heavy vote thanks to ""joke"" candidates, it may be novelty, interest or love for the character, not policy itself declared by the party that encouraged citizens to vote. I think it is meaningless and not good thing. Furthermore, if a ""joke"" candidate put his heart into the role extremely, it will lead to a disturbance of the public order. Star Wars' character is a good example. In conclusion, freedom of political activity should be permitted in democracy, but, at the same time, there should be restriction to some extent. In addition, parties such as Internet Party must think of the political policies earnestly and we have to turn our eyes to them not only their eccentric appearances."
NBE06404,"I think that this man was the sarcasm to the Russia. First in the movie, Chewbacca was forced to work at the Galactic Empire. Later Han Solo saved Chewbacca and they cooperated to overthrow Galactic Empire. In Ukraine, historically, there were two parties. The party that supports Russia and the party that supports EU. These days, the problem of Crimea is the huge problem in the world. The problem of Crimea between Ukraine and Russia is difficult and hard to understand. So I quote the website of HAARETZ, ""Crimea was absorbed into the Russian empire along with most of ethnic Ukrainian territory by Catherine the Great in the 18th century. Russia's Black Sea naval base at Sevastopol was founded soon afterwards. More than half a million people were killed in the Crimean War of 1853-56 between Russia and the Ottoman Empire, which was backed by Britain and France. The conflict reshaped Europe and paved the way for World War One. In 1921, the peninsula, then populated mainly by Muslim Tatars, became part of the Soviet Union. The Tatars were deported in masse by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin at the end of World War Two for alleged collaboration with the Nazis. "" And why Crimea is the part of Russia? ""Crimea only became part of Ukraine when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave the peninsula to his native land in 1954. This hardly mattered until the Soviet Union broke up in 1991 and Crimea ended up in an independent Ukraine. Despite that, nearly 60 percent of its population of 2 million identify themselves as Russians. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, there have been periodic political tussles between over its status between Moscow and Kiev. "" I think that this man wanted to raise a doubt about the problem between Russia and Ukraine."
NBE06431,"I agree with your opinion. I think that the story of Star Wars is very very difficult. It was the time of the primary schoolchild that I saw Star Wars for the first time, but was not able to understand the contents of the story at all. The only memory to remember clearly is that a light saver is very cool. I was not able to understand even the face and the name of character and not know Chewbacca either. And I think that it is ban to mix every play for election, too. The holy activity which called the election should be carried out faithfully and anybody must not elect someone in for fun. The politician chosen by election represents the country. If one step is wrong, there is the risk to become the catastrophe that may shake the basis of the country. May I participate with a costume play as election including such risk? By a serious appearance, should I not participate in election with a faithful feeling. It may be surely a good thing to add a simple image to election so that many people participate in the election with the too faithful image. This is because the youth's keeping away from election is remarkable. In this time when the election participation rate decreases, the plan that is such a catchy may be the measure. It may be a good thought, but, I think that, in election, the faithfulness that is one of the important requirement must meet it."

A question remains whether the election that important requirements fell out is really reliable election. I think that In election, both a person with the right to vote and the person having eligibility for election should participate in election seriously."
NBE06051,"This news is very humorous and interesting, I think. Star Wars is known all over the world, so Ukraine's Internet Party should have attracted attention of many people. To collect votes this is very effective. In Japan, Entertainers and athlete as so on are often concerned with politics. Their name and character must be known to many people. These resemble closely very much, I think. These are effective to collect votes, you know. But I want to say this situation is not always good. Even if it was a famous person, he may not work well. The mistake is not permitted in the politics. So a person with the knowledge should do politics, I sure. It is interesting as far as I see it from the other place, but if a candidate like this news appears in Japan, I must doubt."
NBE07044,"When I read the title of this article for the first time, I thought that what Chewbacca is because I am not familiar with ""Star Wars"". While I went on reading the part of beginning, I felt that is funny and even wanted a incident such this article to take place in Japan because absolutely a incident like this never happen in Japan. Until I finish reading the part of end, indeed I did not even think that there was a deep political background. Because I studied world history at time of the high school student, I knew that Ukraine became independent from the Soviet Union, but I surely did not still know that power of West Europe is opposed to power of the Russian-supporting rebels in Ukraine now. Because Ukraine is located between West Europe and Eastern Europe, the position of Ukraine is delicate politically and geographically. After all, I want Ukraine to become democratic in the same way as Japan, but at first it should be first priority to stabilize domestic politics. If it becomes so, Chewbacca will not fall into the dark side."
NBE05790,"I agree with your opinion greatly. I think they are excited by themselves only, don't admire the characters. And then, That this is acted at politics is dishonest. It shouldn't be resolved as a practical jokes."
NBE05525,"I knew only the title of Star Wars, but I did not know such detailed character of the name and the contents of the story. So, at first it was difficult for me to understand what this article said. But I began to understand While I promoted reading. I was really surprised that such a political party is not a joke. In Japan, To be outdone in Ukraine, This year, movie of STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is published and fan of star wars has also risen. in Ukraine, the number of candidates belonging to the political party of ""Darth Vader Blocks"" is 48 people. Of which 44 people are referring to themselves as the Vader. It is true that Ukrainians love Star Wars obsessively. I thought Ukraine is humorous country. Although I think such a party will not come out in Japan, if it do that, this will not solve laughing matter. In addition, it was further surprised to hear that candidate dressed as villain of the ""Star Wars"" won 54% of the support rate and he was elected. He seems to become city council member in southwest Odessa of Ukraine. Elected politicians can play an important role to determine the management of the area. So, of course, such election result is not good. I think that the Ukrainians should think about own country seriously. However, why was such a result? This situation doesn't represent that Ukrainians are stupid but a sign of dissatisfaction with politics . It sounds like people have claimed that "" Whatever people are selected, the politics will not change"", ""the first place politicians are rotten. "" I hope that Ukrainian politics are better, and clever politicians are elected. At the same time, I also hope that the people who do the efficient politics come out, so that Japan does not fall into situations such as Ukraine."
NBE06469,"This news was very unique, and it was a good chance for me to be interested in politics of Ukraine. However, in Ukraine that the political situation is unstable the incident occurred in other cities that the group of the secessionist who received the Russian support collided with Ukraine forces and the election canceled. Surely it looks like an interesting funny case. However, to be frank, I want all nations including dozen Vader to face the current political situation of Ukraine seriously and work hard to improve it. . ."
NBE06593,"I could not understand the article too. I have not seen 'Star Wars'. Since many character were appeared in this article, it was difficult for me to grasp the contents. In Japan, election campaign is controlled strictly. Therefore such a strange accident do not happen. The Ukrainian government should take action against candidates for a cleaner form of democracy. Owing to loose regulation, local elections are lacking in discipline. The Ukrainian government have to solve the problem promptly for Ukrainians."
NBE07069,"At first, I like Star Wars very much. So, when I saw the headline, I thought that this news is interesting. And I thought it was only a joke, because such a political movement is impossible in Japan. I think that there are both good point and bad point for this political movement. At first, we can not understand what kind of policy the Ukraine's Internet Party is advocating, and what kind of politics they want to do. When we conform to the story of Star Wars, Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine are enemies of Jedi Knight and Rebel. In the story, Palpatine was one of the republican members of the Diet, but he have used a stratagem and planned it so that all power of the republic concentrated on himself. After all, he succeeded in overthrowing the republic and he introduced himself as 'Emperor'. Then Galactic Empire was born. The politics by the empire was domination of fear using menace of 'DEATH STAR' and 'STORM TROOPER' . If I were Ukrainian, I would not vote for Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine as one of the Star Wars fan. But if the Ukraine's Internet Party that Darth Vader leads proposes a policy which is good for the nation, I may vote for them. In other words, what I want to say is that the most important thing in politic is contents. However, recently the people who don't pay attention to contents of the politics are increasing. The tendency is strongly seen in young people. Actually, my friends who are university students will not know what kind of policy each political party is advocating. I also understand it. But by having seen this news, I became interested the policy of the Internet Party and the history of the party. After I researched, I think I can not trust them, but it is really important for us to be interested in politics in this way. I think this movement is good at the point to let us pay more attention to politics. As we know, 2015 is the year when Star Wars episode 7 'THE FORCE AWAKENS' was shown. The boom of Star Wars was coming all over the world. Of course I also looked forward to the exhibition very much! I have watched the movie twice in theater! Episode 3 of previous work was shown in 2005. For ten years, Star Wars fans have been waiting. The Internet Party might do such a performance for the purpose of getting on this ""Star Wars wave"". In this way, we can visit it from outside, but Ukrainians are serious. Probably disappointment and dissatisfaction of the nations should reach the considerable level because of military pressure of the neighborhood of border from Russia and admission of Crimea in Russia. In such a case, if political party such as internet Party appears, I think a strange situation may be happened. If the person who is not interested in politics or who does not expect for politics vote for this party with the intention of the joke, it is bad democracy. (This is only a possibility to the last). When I think in this way, I could understand the danger of not knowing the politics. I will be 20 years old on the next birthday, and through this news, I realize that it is important to understand the manifesto and way of thinking of parties. By the way, the headline of this news is'Chewbacca' arrested in Ukraine after breaking election rules. I like Chewie in the movie. Chewie is popular in his cute voice. As a copilot of the millennium falcon and as the fellow of Han Solo, he brought about the excellent scene. But I don't like this Chewie who broke legislation that forbids campaigning on Election Day and don't pay the fine. The reason he don't pay is that his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet. I was disgusted with this remark. If this is not a political situation, it is a laughable joke. However, this is the election that is most important in democracy. They must collect votes based on rule and without injustice! The point that I was most surprised at in this news is that Lenin statue was transformed to the Darth Vader statue. It is unbelievable that such a permission was granted. And I thought Lenin turned to ""Dark Side""."
NBE07070,"I am agree with you. And I like Star wars, too. This is a serious problem for Ukrainian. The country has a lot of problem. Many Ukrainians hope for a cleaner form of democracy. This Chewie who broke legislation that forbids campaigning on Election Day and don't pay the fine should not be permitted. He must not have a qualification about election."
NBE07136,"When I read this article, I was very astonished. Why did you think Chewbacca was arrested? But Chewbacca remained in this article, and I had no relation. It was bad that Chewbacca broke a law. I think even the character of Star Wars has to observe the law. But I think the idea that it's better to disguise itself as the famous character and be watched at election. A decline of the election rate is a problem now in Japan. I think it's also one of countermeasures I elect uniquely, and to raise the interest of the people."
NBE07290,"When I read this article for the first time, I was very surprised at this news. Because I have never watched Star Wars. I did not know any character of name. So it is very difficult for me to understand. It is very interesting. But we have to consider this problem seriously."
NBE07392,"Me too! I agree with you. I have never watched Star Wars, so I can hardly understand about this incident and believe this is real event when I read this article at first."
NBE05853,"When I read this article for the first time, I was surprised that ""joke"" candidates like Chewie and Emperor Palpatine exist in official elections. In that time, I am angry with the candidates because it is ridiculous that someone runs for officials as a joke. However, I realize that not only ""non-joke "" candidates but also ""joke"" candidates compose of liberal societies. As you know, such ""joke"" candidates like Dr. Nakamatsu also exist in Japan. In the modern world, many countries' politics with universal suffrage are based on the idea of democracy and liberalism. If we are based on their idea, not only ""non-joke "" candidates but also ""joke"" candidates are good and free. Meanwhile, in full-grown democratic societies, such ""joke"" candidates cannot be elected to officials because citizens understand that it is not well for them to elect ""joke"" candidates to officials. By the way, I have never seen ""Star Wars"" before. So, I have pain to read this article. The other day, the latest ""Star Wars"" series movie was released and the series movies are in the spotlight. Since ""Star Wars"" series movies are told a masterpiece by many movie fans, I would like to see ""Star Wars"" in my spring break!"
NBE06303,"This news uses many metaphors and it make me interested in it. The arrest of Chewbacca is funny one, but in fact Ukraine has many problems. The local elections were marked by traditional dirty tactics such as voter-buying, spoiler candidates and backroom deals and so on. Now Star Wars is boomed again , but we should look into real problems seriously."
NBE06468,"Surely in Japan, Entertainers and athlete as so on are often concerned with politics!!! This case is similar to the candidacy of dozen Vader. However, it is the story that the people who have been elected only with popularity often damage the politics. Because it cannot happen, I think that the running people have to acquire knowledge about politics and manner well. . ."
NBE07393,"There is intervention of police for this incident, but there are many nuisances that we have not pick up as violations. Smoking is one of these problems, I think. I believe smoking in the prohibited area should be banned in public places. Recently, several countries have restricted the areas in which people may smoke. Scientist agree that smoking is dangerous. Smoking does not just harm the smoker; it also harms people nearby, who breathe in the smoke. Smokers choose to smoke, but people nearby do not choose to smoke passively. A more strict ban on smoking in public is needed to protect people from passive smoking. Indeed, there may be little relationship between this incident and smoking, however, I think we need to grasp this incident more widely on this occasion."
NBE05852,"I disagree with your idea because I believe that not only ""non-joke"" candidates but also ""joke"" candidates compose of liberal societies. In the modern world, many countries' politics with universal suffrage are based on the idea of democracy and liberalism. When our politics are based on their idea, not only ""non-joke"" candidates but also ""joke"" candidates are good and free. However, I respect you. You always try to listen to others carefully and take in the idea which you don't have from others. I would like to imitate you and feel the pleasure of studying all together in the class."
NBE05825,"First time I read this story, I didn't understand what this whole news was about. Because of the many nouns I have never seen like Chewbacca, Wookiee, Odessa, but after I looked up these words I soon understood it. At first, I thought ""A man dressed as Chewbacca was arrested in Ukraine because of breaking legislation that forbids campaigning on Election Day"" and the face that he was campaigning for ""Darth Vader"" was funny. And the fact that he told the local reporters ""he had no way to pay the fine because his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet"" made it even funnier. I am sure that the news of the arrest was met with amusement online around the world too, however IT IS NO JOKING MATTER FOR MANY UKRAINIANS. It is natural that they have to be serious about the politics, since they have a lot of problems to solve like Crimean region affairs. About the election, I think it should be kept clean with no dirty tactics so that Ukrainian government can introduce the ""new kind of politics"". Also in the article it says that there was a related news that a statue of Lenin was transformed by Ukrainian artists last week. And it is because of the law banning any public statues of its communist past. As I said I thought it was funny, but its not. I do not understand why they are trying to mix the politics with funny things. It should be separated and never should get mixed. I have totally the same opinion with Borovik. It is beyond my understanding and I am like what is wrong with people these days about those things."
NBE06685,"Surely it was after a man dressed as 'Chewbacca' broke legislation that forbids campaign on Election Day that he arrested in Ukraine. This is a serious matter and a crime. We must obey the law of your own nation. He should be judged and may insult the people who live in Odessa. And his action may insult and disturb democratic politics and election. However, I was surprised in this news when I read this article for the first time. Saying in other words, I was confused and can't understand this news. Because the character of very very popular movie among people all over the world, Star Wars took part in the election, did a political campaign and made a political party. I feel liberty in Ukraine. I was amazed these humor. If the famous character of Japanese animation or movie do a political campaign in Japan, I think he/she or they is criticized by conservative people. For instance, I feel more humorous in a president's speech of USA than a prime minister's speech of Japan. I think it is wonderful thing to permit this humor. So I think difference of culture and tolerance of nation when I read this article."
NBE07356,"I agree with you. I wonder if the voters really thought of what the candidate with a well-known character name will do after winning the election. It seems people just chose him because his name is famous and funny. There might be some people electing him with other reasons. However, it is just unclear. To make it fair, I think nobody should not use character names in elections."
NBE06683,"I agree with you. When I read this article for the first time, I didn't still watch Star Wars. I can't understand the terms of Star Wars, 'Chewbacca', 'the Wookiee', 'Darth Vader' and 'The Sith Lord' and so on. I watched Star Wars recently. I can understand the terms now. So I think this article is lack of consideration for people who never watch Star Wars."
NBE05695,"As you said, I think this news contained some metaphors, because it was so weird that it attracted people's attention from other countries, and it made people notice that the traditional dirty tactics had remained in Ukraine. Ukraine was before a part of Soviet Union that took socialism, but it locates next to Europe that takes democracy. As a result, the Ukrainian can be separated into two groups that have different opinion on politics. In my opinion, these situation makes Ukrainian politics complex."
NBE05907,"I think that ""joke"" candidates are not good method to use for democracy. Public trust is the basis of politics, so election should be sacredness. This is an issue which affects politics. Certainly, sensible citizens would not vote such a candidate, but it will destroy the atmosphere. Especially, in a region where a election system still needs polishing, it must not be permitted. As a real event, in this news story, ""joke"" candidate was winning. In Japan, there are some celebrity politicians and they run for an election of the members of the House of Councilors to be a figurehead who attracts the support for their political party. Some of them live up to citizens' expectations, on the other hands, some of them give rise to problem behavior. It can be related to an unfair estimation of political party. Thus, I think that ""joke"" candidates are not good for democracy. In addition to this issue, there is another issue that Ukraine is still under the control of Russia. Even though a wave of demonstrations, the Euromaidan revolution, happened in 2014, Ukraine has never turned into a real democratic country. Then traditional dirty tactics such as voter-buying, spoiler candidates and backroom deals still have been used. If Ukraine seriously wants to get out of the control by Russia and become an independent country as a democratic one, Ukraine should begin to reflect its nations' opinions. Clearly, changing traditional methods of politics is not easy, so at least the government should listen to public opinions. Speaking of democracy, it is eminent for politicians to consider what welfare and needs people want the government to make meet. As a result, I believe that using ""joke"" candidates is inappropriate way to make a good flow of politics. Also, I think that Ukraine ought to see other countries in the world as many of them have become democratic since globalization has developed in the recent decades and that it is important to consider better way to be democratic by leaning what it should do or not do from the previous revolution."
NBE07266,"I agree with your opinion and I did not know about Chewbacca because I have never watched Star Wars too. So I was very surprised and felt funny when I heard this news at first. But after understanding what was Chewbacca and so on, I thought this news was very seriously and interesting, because I have never seen such a news in Japan. You said that we have to consider this problem seriously, I think so too! And I want to spread to people who don't know about the Star Wars' any characters. And I want to exchange our opinions about this problem."
NBE06159,"I agree with your opinion and I think so, too. When I read this article for the first time, I only paid attention to the look of Chewbacca because he had a lot of visual impact for me. However, it was not until I read it some times that I noticed about what he wants to declare firmly, and it was so great. And I think it is a good peg for people all over the world to know the reality of life for many Ukrainians."
NBE06231,"You are right. I only focused on the joke candidates, but now I see it also important to think about the traditional dirty tactics already existed. We have to find what is happening there in reality."
NBE06745,"I agree with your opinion that no one want to follow him even if he is elected. I think it will not make true democracy, too. A election system is very important for political."
NBE05579,"I agree with you. Candidates who ran playfully will give a bad effect on democracy. Politics must be faced with a belief in themselves and their political parties. Therefore to run for election in half ridicule is a insult to other candidates. Correspondence of the Ukrainian government for such candidates is reasonable. I think that there is a chance that comedian who is not familiar with politics is not good. You should go extrusion with his policies and a commitment to bring it forward if to run for election. With person of name recognition and policy combined, it will be possible to spread widely the policy. It is also often cited as hereditary problems in Japanese politics. However, that the child is interested in the profession of his father as a matter of course. The eligibility is a right that everyone has. This is why it is not inequality. I also want to become a politician if there is a chance."
NBE05696,"I have a different opinion. I agree with your opinion at the point that he should be arrested due to break legislation that forbids campaigning, but I don't think so much that such people never appear as you said. I am not fanatic fan of Star Wars myself, so I cannot understand his feeling, but his action is one of the political claims that he supported for Darth Vader. Recently, in Japan, young people are not interested in politics and don't participate in political election, which situation is one of the social problems. Compared with this situation, this event is wired indeed, but I don't think a severe problem."
NBE06377,"That is an interesting opinion. Actually I also thought he did this occasion to get attention from all over the world. When I watched this news on TV, I was so interested in the political party which Chewbacca is belonging to, because it is so a unique idea. Add to this, TV show also picked up this political party in the Ukraine over the daily. His act after arresting was in an embarrassing way, but it was also impressive. I did not know anything about the Star Wars till I checked this topic on the Internet, so I studied the characters of the Star Wars and the situation in the Ukraine because I thought that is a good opportunity to know them. We cannot see those political activity in Japan. In this time, their performance is known as a bad action to the world, however, young people might get interests in politics if any Japanese political party tries to do some unique performance like that. I do not know their future, but I expect that they will make a contribution for the Ukraine if they do not break the rule any more."
NBE06160,"I also laughed that arrested man said ""as his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet. "" It is very funny joke. I think it helps that the news was met with amusement online all over the world. It was a great effect. And I agree with your opinion about Democracy, too. The better education becomes, the more knowledge of politics a lot of young people acquire."
NBE06198,"I know there are Darth Vader and his subordinates in Ukraine, but don't know that Chewbacca, one of Darth Vader's subordinates, was arrested. In addition, I don't know Star Wars very much. However, hearing the news, I think Star Wars is very famous movie all over the world and a lot of people like Star. By the way, there are a lot of election systems in the world. In Ukraine, people who want to stand as a candidate don't need to use real name. So, Darth Vader could come forward as a candidate by name of ""Darth Vader"". In Brazil, all candidates can decide their candidate name, too. Of course, Japan and a lot of countries don't allow candidates to decide their candidate name, but it has several merits for candidates to decide their candidate name. A first merit is that unique names are often born and that the election activates very much. If election activates very much, a lot of citizen will be interested in politics. Next merit is that candidates can have character by candidate name which candidates decide. If candidate name were ""Darth Vader"", the candidate will get very strong character. However, this system has big demerit. It is citizen can't know candidate's real maybe. This incident occurs for the demerit."
NBE05962,"When I read this article for the first time I was very surprised. Some people in the class say that we have to take it into serious consideration and it is the matter of democracy. However it is just a joke. It is a funny news. And I am a big fun of Star Wars so this news is very interesting for me. I don't have many information and impression about Ukraine, but this news make me have the impression about the country that the country is full of sense of humor. Darth Vader is running for a mayor of a city? Chewbacca is campaigning for Darth Vader and he was arrested? What a amusing news it is! I was not able to read this article without laughing. These days this country has been reported to the dark side of it so many have negative image about this country. However these kind of funny news may make us who have negative image about the county change the way we think about the country."
NBE06467,"I agree with your opinion. ""Joke""candidates must understand the unstable politics in Ukraine. But For foreign people this case might be the good occasion that they were interested in the recently politics in Ukraine."
NBE05697,"I myself am not interested in Star Wars, so I cannot understand this incident. However, I saw lots of fans all over the world excited when a new movie of Star Wars series was released last month, I thought maybe this man was also one of the fanatical fans of Star Wars. Just by looking, adult man dressed as Chewbacca and campaigned for Darth Vader was so crazy and childish. But considering political background of Ukraine, this may be one of the way of protesting to the government and insisting his policy. In 2014 the Euromaidan revolution led to the resignation of President Viktor Yanukovych, many Ukrainians hoped for a cleaner form of democracy, and closer ties with Europe. Instead, since then the Crimean region has been taken over by Russia, and the eastern parts of the country have seen fighting between locals and Russian-supporting rebels. Therefore Ukraine's political affair has been not stable. In fact, the local elections were still marked by traditional dirty tactics. I imagine that he wanted to escape from reality whose government was smeared with dirty tactics and he mixed up real word and fiction Star Wars world."
NBE06050,"I agree with you. Even if they were able to win a vote, there is not conclusive evidence whether or not they do politics properly. Actually, we cannot vote for a doubtful person in Japan, too. On the other hand, this news let us be interested in politics. This is a nice chance, I think. Because the other day, the government decided person 18 years old or older to allow the right to vote but most of youth are unconcerned about politics. So we should have more interest in them first."
NBE06713,"I think this news show bad aspect of democracy like populism. Democracy is really revolutionary tool that has many bad points. To get over that, high-level education is needed."
NBE06801,"I read this article, this incident has been treated like a joke, but never not those that may be received in that way, it was thought to be those which are considered more seriously. Also, because I was interested in Star Wars by reading this article, I was looking back the whole work."
NBE06684,"I do not agree with you. Because I can't understand this article when I read it for the first time. I can't understand the Star Wars's words. For example, 'Chewbacca', 'the Wookiee', 'Darth Vader' and 'The Sith Lord' are. I think is is easy for this article to have to be understand."
NBE06076,"muslim is enemy, the Idea to capture the word as enemy or Ally of dualism, makes the word simplify too much. in 2015, the word was shocked by Islamic state group. for instance, two of the victims were Japanese, intruding a journalist who often reported from war zones. and in the world, Paris was the target of the separate attacks at the star and the end of the year. radical jihadists claimed responsibility for both sets of attacks which together killed More than 140 people, and in America, 14 people was killed by a terror attack in California. now the word has been rattled by IS. French present Francois Hollande said, ""France is at the war"" and vows revenge against Islamic state for Paris attacks. and US president Barack Obama vowed December 6 that America would destroy the Islamic state group and hunt down its followers at home or abroad, in rare address from the oval office. This problem has also affected the issue of the world's immigrants. in France, French voters give far right party historic election wins. and US Republicans seek to refuse Syria refugees. It is a part of a mounting republican backlash against the Obama administration's plan to accept thousands more immigrants from the war-torn country. US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump insisted Nov. 29 he was ""100 percent right "" when he said that he saw thousands of Muslims in Jersey City, New Jersey, cheering the 9/11 attacks on the world trade center. he also defended his provocative call to ban Muslims from the United States and in a then show race reshaped by national security concerns. Terrorism is a show involving the audience, I guess. To distinguish between the people in the wake of terrorism is like terrorists' ideal world. a thought ""we will not give in Inhumane terrorism"" which conflicts with terrorists and people never solve the problems. and it's not only talking about Syria. we should not exclude the minority like ""To Kill a Mockingbird"""
NBE07103,"I found it quite fun and interesting reading this news at the first time. First the picture inserted in the article was surprising. I did not recognize the creature which is getting caught in the picture so I was stunned at the first time. I thought a giant UMA was caught which is named, Chewbacca, and released to the public. Yet, by the time when I was half way down of the article I could only stop but to laugh. I did not really finish the article because it is not worth argued with someone about it. It was interesting to relate something very familiar like Star Wars and politics. It surely helps people to be more interested in politics which lead to the increase of participation of people in elections and political activities. I that case I am very positive about it. People do not always get interested in complicated things like politics so politicians have to come up with some unique idea to increase the participation rate of people. In this case is that especially for young people who have the right to vote which means that young people who are over 18 ( different situation exist in different countries). However, it does not mean that the level of politics will improve by just increase the number of participants to the elections or political activities. Or maybe the situation will get worth by increasing the number of uneducated participants. Uneducated political participants will be easily influenced by cheap media or propagandas. People who have not received any appropriate education about politics will give a negative impact to other people. What I thought when I read this news is that I would love to see more interesting and fun image on politics but politics is the most important task to think about in democratic countries."
NBE06403,"I do not agree with your comment. Because, the man wear the costume of Chewbacca on purpose to make people interested."
NBE07104,"What I felt was completely same as you. I could help but to laugh when I first saw this article. However, it can be a good spice for young people and give a positive influence on young people who do not participate in politics."
NBE07231,"I really agree with you. I think Japanese is also more sensible than other countries. But I think only Ukrainian is not to blame for this situation. Their country has many problem. For example, Russia is always thinking and doing something to annex the part of the country. Ukrainian is also always scaring that when the time come, Russia come to annex their land with military power. This stress makes Ukrainian mentally unstable. In Addition, Ukraine was a socialist nation. So she couldn't do well economically and be given support from West Europe. It is cruel to say to behave like other developed European countries to the people under such situation."
NBE06078,"I was surprised at this news as you, and I agree with you. Our reaction seems that Japan has a democracy."
NBE06402,"I disagree your comment strongly. Because we have the liberty of politics, the man can be a candidate under the law."
NBE06077,"I want to praise the brave man in Chewbacca. Although, the exception is pattern that Russia government participate in this action."
NBE06126,"I agree with you. I was very surprised when I know this news. It will not take place in Japan. Star Wars is popular in Ukraine, so costume of Star Wars is suitable to attract attention. However I think that they should follow a law. The politician should give the nation security."
NBE07508,"I have never watched Star Wars before so I can't understand what these characters are. However I was surprised that it was connected with politics. Some people commented that it should be free what people wear so the man should not be punished. I disagree with this opinion. Even it is democracy, there is common sense and the man has no common sense I think. That occasion was not a private party or a costume competition. I don't know if the man wanted to capture more people's attention, but his behavior was a shame to other politics. I learned that we should be able to tell the difference between right and wrong especially in the public occasion."
NBE05055,"I really agree with this sentence. ""Although the news of the arrest was met with amusement online around the world, the reality of life for many Ukrainians is no joking matter"". Of course, the characters are famous all over the world. There are many funs in Japan. Now, we can see everything throughout the Internet, so the sensational news like this will spread quickly. I think it is not bad thing, however, there are no sympathy feelings. So I think that is a problem."
NBE05459,"I think the police arrest by this incident is reasonable. In the influence election of the country in the future, I think that you use the character of the famous movie violates greatly to fairness of the election. It would become unnecessarily increase the people to vote without considering the policy."
NBE05085,"The news difficult for me. The person wear full-body suit like Chewbacca. That is strange thing and the article talk a lot of things connecting with Star Wars. I confuse real thing on fiction. So, the news difficult for me."
NBE05345,"This news is very interested for me. Therefore I research this troubles. The Star Wars character Chewbacca has been dragged before a court in Odessa, in perhaps the most surreal episode in local elections across Ukraine that have been both hotly contested and rife with dirty tricks. The man inside the costume was fined 170 hryvnia for the ""administrative offense"" of not being able to produce identification documents. A statement posted on the official Instagram account of the Ukrainian police read: ""Nothing unusual here, just Chewbacca detained for being without documents while driving Darth Vader to the elections in Odessa. The Sith Lord has already claimed this was illegal as Chewbacca is his pet and general servant and thus does not require documents. "" Police had earlier dragged ""Chewbacca"" from a polling station and put him in a van after accusing him of disrupting proceedings. The person in the costume said he had been there to support Darth Vader, who was attempting to vote. I was very surprised this topics. 'Chewbacca' arrested in Ukraine after breaking election rules View Post"
NBE05320,"This news story made me surprised very much. This is the first time I heard that candidates wore costume of character. I thought that the man disguised as that character because he wanted to say he was clever like this character at first because I did not know about STAR WARS. So I searched about STAR WARS and the character Chewbacca on the Internet. Surprisingly, Chewbacca cannot speak and can understand only basic language. They are misunderstood by people as savage animals because of their appearances. I was not able to find out the advantages of disguising himself as Chewie. But I consider that he only wanted to gather people's attentions by the costume. I think disguising oneself as a character of movies or comics has bad effect for election. Some people might decide who to vote only because of their costume. Candidates should gather votes by their own manifesto. And people have to make decision who to vote by deeply considering about not only their surface but also their manifesto and thinking or behavior before the election."
NBE05318,"I agree with your opinion. The person who costumed as Chewbacca did no prohibited action but his action brought bad effect to the election. Election is not event which candidates gather people's attention by their costume. Candidates should show people their manifesto and their earnest will to the politics. I agree with your idea that the statement ""as his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet. "" is too insincere. More faithful person is necessary to go into politics."
NBE05083,I agree with your idea. The news story like a joke but it isn't joke. Election is very important event so I think they should think much more and rethink their idea that vote the candidate.
NBE05187,"In deed, your opinion that Chewie is not a clever character, but I think its costumed man chose the character because it was like mascot character and lovely. Also, Star Wars is one of the world widest movies, so he chose this character, I felt. I wish the future that young people are also attracted to elections comes."
NBE05319,I almost agree with you but I have only one point which I am not for. This costuming behavior is humor but not less reliable. Candidates should not make laugh in such ways. The point is remaking the statue of lenin to Darth Vader is sign of people's longing for new world. I do not think so. I think people who remade the statue did such action for only own satisfaction.
NBE05215,"I agree with your opinion. I think candidates have to change their clothes which is appropriate to the occasion. The reason why is simple, we can not respect the person who wears a black tie in the wedding. The clothes have the way which represent the situation one person is included. If we are in the party of wedding, we have to wear white tie. In your comment, one student in your class said like that, nowadays, it is freedom what kind of clothes a person chooses to wear. However, it is definitely different from the custom , I think. Please don't misunderstand what I want to say. I would not like to tell you about the way of choosing your suit clothes but want you to know what is important. The person who have stable sensation gives people good impression. I think except the people who is perverse, almost all usual people tend to like the person who is kind or has common sense."
NBE05639,"I agree with your opinion in the hope of democratization of Ukraine. When I knew this news for the first time, I have only the impression of an interesting story, but in fact, there was a deep political background. This case in itself becomes the mere funny story, but political and geographical problems of Ukraine are the complicated and serious circumstances that tormented Ukrainian people for many years. It is true that the act of this false Chewbacca did the annoying social act that disturbed the election activity, but it is also a fact that many people have a chance to pay attention to Ukrainian political problems like you and me. To become democratic, truly for Ukraine, the government, which can change politics is above all important. Therefore, I want there to push forward election smoothly for next time. In addition, I am glad if they play an active part in the pleasant scenes such as Star Wars new movie exhibitions, not the serious situation such as the election activity in the future."
NBE06022,"I don't think so. It is unique! When I read this article I thought this is fiction for campaigning for election or movie. Because Star Wars has been popular in the world, and Star Wars sequel will be published next year. So I thought the movie production attempt a plan that election and movie advertisement go to the world. But it is nonfiction. I was so surprised. The man in the Chewbacca was arrested on suspicion of election law violations. He was shouting and rampaged. It is not allowed. His bad action becomes annoying to the Star Wars production company. But I think it is not bad to join to election even if somebody participates in the cosplay. Because it can be opportunity people who are not interest in their county election are actively participate in them. But this time is not good way for expression. Do not be never become a nuisance. This happen can be not imagined in Japan. May be Japanese is said to shy. But Japanese is not interest in own country elections. It is say numbers. Last election voter turnout is under 60%. It is not high, even compared with the global. If we want to say to Japanese government, we have to express in the election before movement"
NBE06619,"Humorous people is in any countries and it is also true that there is humorous people who are pulling the society. However, humorous people must choose the time and place when they do humorous action. This news is a bad example. Ukraine has been paid attention to the Crimean peninsula problem in recent years by many countries. In addition, the Ukrainian people will also began to be interested in politics greatly. Territorial problem is very easy for root of problem to become deep. Especially, in this case, it even easier because Ukrainian opponent is power, Russia. In addition, Ukrainian civil war was severe, many civilians were sacrificed in this civil war. According to domestic politics becoming confused, anyone in Ukraine would want to decide the politics in their will. Maybe citizens also thought such a thing in unified local elections. However, this incident occurred. I can easily understand the anger of the high-minded citizens. When important things affecting their future, for example, the election, are run, if playful guys appear, they won't stand. When I looked the beginning of this incident is from the Internet, I still amazed. There is people thinking the stupid thing in any country. Certainly all humorous man isn't bad. People who have humor tends to be a good leader. I think Junichiro Koizumi is a good example. However, the humor at this time is not only just play. I want them to consider their future more. Aside from this topic, Chewbacca is the fellow that act together with the Han Solo of the light side. But I think why you are rooting for Darth Vader of the dark side."
NBE07496,"when I read this article, what I thought first was like ""If some Japanese parties pretend to be some character and they do campaign I would definitely go to vote and voting rate must be up"" but in this case, I think they do too much. In another news article, I read that they change their ID for pretending to the character. For example, when Darth Vader went to the election place, he showed ID written ""Darth Ivanovich Vader"" and he was rejected. I also read seven of the Darth Vader's, Yoda and Chewbacca were nominated for parliament by the Internet Party, which champions technological advancement and demands an end to corruption. As I wrote on the top of this comments, it must be good way to attract people but it is difficult to find out how they are serious for politics. Also their face is hidden by their costume, so we cannot see their expression, which is not good for campaign. I love star wars like many people but it does not mean I can support their party. we should think politics and movie are separate."
NBE05481,"I couldn't understand this news when I read this so I researched other articles about this news. I was very surprised that Chewbacca was arrested, but was surprised that dozen Vader went for the mayoral election more. Ukraine is a country full of the humor. Having been arrested this time Chewbacca (the man who played the part) of the political party member called Internet Party of Ukraine. On Sunday of the end of last week, an election for mayor is held in the town of Odessa, and it is about the polling place that a thing happened. When Chewbacca comes to the spot by car with storm true par, and a paper is found by a police officer; is a problem occurrence by having been license non-possession. I was arrested saying that I performed a vicious act to refuse a result, the legal question of the police officer and was assigned to fine approximately 900 yen equivalency."
NBE05482,"I understand your opinion and I agree. I didn't know that Chewbacca is a character of STAR WARS as you didn't know. If this happen in Japan, Japanese people would think him strange. As you say, disguising oneself as a character of movies or comics has bad effect for election. People should think the meaning of vote for election and consider each candidates deeply before the election. Their manifesto and thinking or behavior will effect the election."
NBE06620,"I agree with your opinion. Now, Ukraine is very politically unstable situation. Ukrainians are working seriously to politics. And to be disturb is very unpleasant for them. If you see such a person in Japan's election, ordinary human will get angry. Of course cosplay is not entirely bad. I think that it wants followed in the future as one of entertainment. However, I want them to observe the TPO. Have you ever seen people singing a song and dancing a dance in the polling stations of Japan? Such a person doesn't exist."
NBE05108,"I was surprised at this article, too. I also think Chewbacca gathered attention, and people all over the world turned their eyes to Ukraine. Next time, I hope Chewbacca will attract people for good behavior."
NBE05084,"I feel so too. When I read the article for the first time, I think that it is a nice joke and it is funny. However, It is true and happen in USA. I think the joke candidates cannot work for USA because they could not win the election themselves and they do these behavior like a joke. That tell us the candidate does not have ability for work. I think we should learn a lot of things because we should vote collect candidate not like a joke candidate."
NBE05989,"I think that the election is very important and holy event for the nation. When I was read this article, I felt uncomfortable. I think that the election should guarantee freedom. But a man who dressed as Chewbacca perverted the meaning of freedom. It was a natural consequence that he was arrested."
NBE06233,"Every point criticizing the current capitalism referred in the article deeply impressed me. In reality, in Japan, the poor are now getting poorer, and the rich are now getting richer, say, we all know Japan is in a serious 'depression', which generally makes income gap wider. Though we can see slight inflation nowadays, the situation is still far from good. And, what is more, when it comes to discussing Japanese future generation, we can hardly be optimistic, considering the fact that Japan has a great national debt. Putting the environmental problem aside, we have to think about Japanese economy first. We cannot manage any environmental problem without money."
NBE07486,"After I read this article, there are two points that I thought. First, I agree with Bill Gates's opinion that without a substantial carbon tax, there's no incentive for innovators or energy buyers to switch. Now we are reaching the limit of cycle of growth in capitalism, I think. Capitalism is an economy system that is made up of making a large quantity of cheap goods in developing countries and selling in developed countries. However, as wages are being raised in developing countries these days, the advantage of price is lost, and then products will not be able to compete on the world market. In such a strained situation, almost all innovators or energy buyers can't afford to switch a new energy source just for the climate problem. Secondly, I thought about Japan. I don't think that the poor are getting poor in Japan, because in Japan, a social security system like welfare is prepared. So the poor can be the rich, depending on how much effort you make. However, I can't be optimistic about the next generation's future in Japan, because the population of Japan is expected to be smaller and we have the problem with immigration. Especially population problem is serious, because the production-age population has been aging, and the young population has been decreasing. We should be faced with such an issue."
NBE06992,"I agree the statement from survey that the poorer get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economics. I think today's society attaches important to academic backgrounds. Mostly, people with an advanced academic backgrounds get good jobs, so people study hard. However, there are the places where you can receive good education if you pay much money, for example, private colleges, cram schools and so on. Therefore the rich can put their wealth to get good education, and the poor can't. Of course, if you don't have much money to use for education, you have another way to get good jobs. This is only one of many examples. However there is a fact that children who were born in poor family have to work for their family and give up to continue to study. The government must deal with this matter we should not let pass."
NBE05191,"When I was a junior high and high school student, I learned about the limit of fossil fuels in this world. I had expected that governments all over the world would solve this problem someday in my heart, but this time, I knew that there were not alternatives to fossil fuels after all. That's why I rethink that everyone around the world should act to reduce CO2 emissions. In addition, I imaged that China only pollute the air with CO2. However that was wrong, and China use resources effectively such as solar energy. Also, Germany and the UK act to reduce greenhouse emissions, so I thought the Japanese should know the fact and start work for reducing CO2 as a member of society on the earth."
NBE06993,"I agree with your opinion that everyone around the world should act to reduce CO2 emissions. If the deterioration of the environment goes on, it influences the lives of next generations, in other words, our descendants. I can't stand the situation that my children or grandchild suffer from environmental issues. Therefore we should discuss a lack of awareness on the part of the persons concerned about environmental issues. I think everyone can do something for reducing CO2 emissions with a conscious effort."
NBE07322,"I don't agree with Bill Gates's point of view. Indeed, as he says, the private sector may be reluctant to produce effective energy alternatives and doesn't contribute to that. However, I don't think that the climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. Of course, the more CO2 a country emits, the more seriously responsible the country is. The way of thinking is natural. Rich countries have to make an effort to reduce that. Yet, the definition of rich countries is not clear. For example, are rising nations included in them? Although they are not called as rich countries, there will be room for reduction in their CO2 emissions. The climate problem has a big impact on the whole world. So I think all countries, not only rich countries, should cooperative to solve the problem. Then, I think the strongest argument against capitalism is that the poor get poorer and the rich get richer. It is difficult to receive an enough education and get a job for the poor. Moreover, income redistribution is necessary, but at the same time, economic growth is important for a country. I think the disparity between the rich and the poor will go on widening in the world."
NBE05792,"According to Bill Gates and latest statistics, it is said to be not prevent our earth from global warming under the situation today. In the system of capitalism, the role of companies is to integrate each company's force to pursue their own benefits. Therefore, they don't regard improvement for environment as important thing without the judgment. They only think their self-defense. Certainly, this theory is justice, but even China which was installed capitalism as a fragment of social system is changing their energy system to natural energy. It is too late for the advanced nation like the U. S to change their own thought. They should think ""dismiss the today's benefit, think the future's it"". I hope the change will achieve in the system of capitalism."
NBE05253,"In my opinion, all country should share information about pollution. I didn't know that China has surged ahead of the United States of America and European countries in green investment in spite of being polluting country in terms if fossil fuels. China also puts emphasize in solar energy and the decrease of CO2 emissions. The country's action for global warming has worked well. In addition to China, Germany and the United Kingdom has made great success in decreasing greenhouse emissions. I think all country, including Japan should consider more about climate change and imitate action what those countries has been doing. I agree with the idea of Bill Gates that the climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries, so the rich countries such as US and Europe should think the solution for that more carefully. If such countries decide to work for solving the problem, the entire world will change and get better."
NBE05252,"I agree with you. After reading the article, I was surprised to know that China has been using resources effectively and other country such as Germany and the United Kingdom has been working for reducing CO2 emissions. Japan is relatively rich country, so the country should begin doing action for the decrease of CO2 emissions as a member of the world community. I hope the condition of the earth to get better as soon as possible."
NBE05139,"These days, the gap between the rich and the poor has become one of the most serious problems in the world. Even in Japan, Economic inequality certainly exists. For example, more and more people lose their jobs because of the depression and they have no choice to be on social security for living. Also, it is said that the pension system in Japan seems to collapse in the near future because of aging society. It will be big damage for elderly people. Furthermore, a lot of people who rent student loans when they were university students cannot earn enough money to pay back them. It is because Japanese employment situation is terrible even for those who graduated from four-year universities properly. Moreover, the consumption tax is going to be raised to ten percent from current eight percent. It can be a hard blow to people who are not so rich. In my opinion, Capitalism is an economic system which can make the gap between the rich and the poor larger. As Bill Gates states, the private sector is always thinking their profits, not poor people or the environment in this planet, I think. Also, what is remarkable is that when people in many countries asked if they think the next generation will probably be richer, safer and healthier than the last, people in Western such as Great Britain, United States of America, and Germany tend to disagree. However, to my surprised, more than half of the people in Asian countries such as India and Thailand answered they agree with this statement. What made them answer so? I guess that almost all the countries in Asia are developing countries. Hence they are able to have a hope toward next generation. Yet, European counties and America are developed countries and probably people living there spend comparatively comfortable lives. However, generally speaking, the world in those days is not good times in good times on a whole. In Japan, after the collapse of overheated stock and real estate markets, the recession has been continued for more than twenty years. Things has become worse and worse. Therefore people in developed countries cannot have a hope to the future. Also there is one more serious problem which must be solved under the corporation of all the human in this world. It is the environmental problem. Since the industry revolution has happened, it goes without saying that the development of the industry can hurt the environment. Because of the dirty air from factories, the cities has been polluted. I must admit that it is essential to make efforts for the development of industry in order to make us richer, but it must not be bad for environment. Too much pollution can kill this planet. As a conclusion, I think it is important to making a lot of products because we can earn money by doing so. But it should be the way where both of poor people and the environment in the Earth aren't be damaged. That's all of my opinion."
NBE05189,"I agree with your opinion. I think that in Japan, the rich can become richer and the poor doesn't even have an opportunity to get rich. Similarly, it is difficult that people who have no opportunity to have a good education get rich now. That's why I also think that such a negative circulation would be repeated many times at this rate. Therefore Japanese government should revise its education system. For example, in Finland, there is no gap, so every child can take the same education. The reason is that the Finnish pay high tax on its education. Moreover, children who have a difficulty in studying can receive cares with special education programs. In addition, teachers there don't have to work for a long time compared with Japan, so the teachers can spare their time for preparing to give good lessons. In conclusion, I think that Japanese government should spend its money not on having achievement tests but on students and teachers."
NBE05614,"This article is difficult for me because the story is too long and too boring. The summary that this article wants to tell is, in short, capitalism as an economic system is bad in a sense. According to this article, capitalism brings the poor which lives in developing countries more poverty. I disagree with this opinion. In my opinion, capitalism brings the poor more fortune. For example, Japanese corporations founded factories in China because they could employ Chinese people in low wages. However, the more Chinese people work in Japanese factories, the richer they become. Eventually, Japanese corporations would pay high wages for Chinese people and leave China. Next, they would found new factories in another developing countries. But another developing countries also will become rich. In this sense, capitalism is not eternal. This article and my opinion have this point in common."
NBE05277,"I also think ""the poor get poorer and the rich get richer"". Because, people who have many money can live comfortably, but people who don't have money cannot live comfortably. Because, people who don't have money cannot make their children go to school. In Japan, many children cannot go to a kindergarten. This is big social problem. The government should solve this problem. And I agree with Bill Gates opinion. I think the rich countries - China, America, and Europe and so on - should solve CO2 emissions. Of course Japan too. But this is very difficult problem. Because it costs very much to decrease CO2. And it will take so much time. According to a news on the Internet, Bill Gates plans to make a nuclear reactor. When I read this article, I thought he contradict himself. He said that the countries should decrease CO2, but he is about to make a things which makes the environment dirty and world dangerous. I cannot believe and understand him. Japanese people knew a danger of a nuclear reactor from Tohoku earthquake. We do not want to have a nightmare."
NBE05416,"This article is very difficult for me. When I first read this article, I was surprised to know that China emits CO2 so much and surged ahead of the US and Europe in green investment. At first, I didn't know Bill Gates. I learned he is an American businessman and found the Microsoft. I was surprised to know that he spends $2 billion of his own wealth on green energy and asked his fellow billionaires to help make the fossil-free by 2050 with similar philanthropy. I praised his charity action because he contributes his own money for energy. I agree with his idea that substantial carbon tax is essential for innovators or energy buyers to change energy source. However, economic system is very complexity, so we should think carefully. In the capitalism society, the poor get poor and the rich get richer. I think capitalism is not so good because this system make a big gap between rich people and poor people because if someone lose his or her job in the capitalism society, it is very difficult to retrieve his or her former position and return to the community. I think we ought to reconsider about the future energy carefully and suggest the innovatory economic plan in order to succeed in the future. In addition, this problem is an international problem, so people all over the world should consider it carefully and work on together."
NBE05415,"I agree with your idea. The gap between rich people and poor people is not good in Japan. We should reconsider the system of capitalism carefully. In addition, energy problem is serious in the world. This is a worldwide problem, so the rich country lead the world, and not only the rich countries but also the poor country discuss and work on together. International cooperation is also important."
NBE06831,"I think that Bill's idea is creative and I agree with his thought. Especially, I was impressed by the opinion that rich countries like the US, China and Europe have to solve the climate problem. Climate problem is caused by these countries including Japan. For these countries, economic development is priority over climate problem. On the contrary, this means climate problem will be solved if these countries make an effort saving CO2. Now, capitalism re-think these problem."
NBE05722,"I agree with idea that rich country like China, Europe, America has to solved the environmental problem. But it is not only rich countries problem. Of course, some climate problem is caused by these countries including Japan. However only rich countries efforts are short-handed. All of the world should make an effort to decrease CO2. I was surprised to know that he spends $2 billion of his own wealth on green energy and asked his fellow billionaires to help make the fossil-free by 2050 with similar philanthropy. People should make an effort to wrestle environmental problem not to say Bill Gates. And the problem that the poor get poorer and the rich get richer is there in Japan too. For example, there are people who haven't problem for entering college and who have problem for entering college in class because there are poverty and wealth in these parents. Possibly compared with world poverty and wealth, Japanese poverty and wealth is not particularly serious problem. But in fact, a middle-class family became gradually a lower-class family in Japan. Japanese government should take steps to deal with poverty and wealth problem and environmental problem."
NBE06748,"I have heard Bill Gates but I didn't know him. I agree his idea that the climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. In Japan, a sign of the CO2 reduction was put up by the Kyoto Protocol, but we haven't achieved the aim yet. Thermal power generation is still a main generation method. generation using a natural energy is difficult from cost and the problem of the place. However, the improvement of system which a great capitalist like Bill Gates can invest in generation is important one of the solution to this problem."
NBE05190,"I agree with your opinion. In Japan, it is true that the poor get poorer, and poor families are always in the negative chain, I feel. This serious situation in Japan is far from good, so everyone who lives in Japan should think about this problem so deeply, and involve the Japanese government in this issue. I think Japanese people are one of the kindest and the most merciful people in the world, so they can think the problem as if it was his or her own one. Also, I felt that I should have also think about this problem deeply, and wanted to discuss it with my family, my friends, my future fellows, and so on."
NBE05056,"China is a country which is developing now, but therefore China has many problems about environment such as Co2, air pollution, pm2. 5. I really agree with Gates's argument. I think the man who has power like him should say his opinion because it will change the individual mind in the world for CO2 problems effectively. In addition to my opinion, Mr. Shinzo Abe, the prime minister of Japan, also have a power that the change the individual mind in the world. His opinion is enough effective, I think."
NBE06595,"I disagree with the opinion that the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies. It is fact that the poor get poor. However it is not impossible for the poor to be rich. There is the way how the poor become rich. For example it is a certified public accountant. You can take a certified public accountant examination anytime. In other words you can take the examination even if you do not graduate from a high school and a university. Generally, if you are rich, you can receive a good education. Regardless of educational background, Anyone can challenge it. To be rich, the poor have to study harder than the rich. If you make efforts and have strong will, you can fulfill your dream. Even if you are poor, there is not dreams that you can not fulfill. The rich tend to waste their money. Since they have much money, they can take a good education. and enter the first-class university. I think that it is important to invest property in their own dreams. It makes no sense if they can not manage money well. In this way, the thought that ""the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies"" is wrong. I hope that the poor will spend rich life. In capitalism economy, society should be formed to protect the weak."
NBE05483,"I understand the climate change is a big problem in the world now. My image of Bill Gates is very smart. He says that capitalism cannot save us from climate change because the private sector is too selfish and inefficient to produce effective energy alternatives to fossil fuels. I agree with his opinion. To produce effective energy will need a lot of costs. Now, CO2 emission became a serious problem in the world, also in Japan. Few years ago, the Japan government announced the target figure about CO2 emission but in real, we could not limit the emission. This is difficult to solve. I think also the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies. The rich countries such as China and the US and Europe should think about climate change deeply."
NBE07204,"I agree with Bill Gates' perception about capitalism and money in the future. Certainly, as we can see, capitalism and countries that introduced capitalism have succeeded to rule the most of the world. They, or to say ""we""?, have exploited the poorer and ignored their condemnation. In the middle-east, The innocent citizens are bombed and killed by many rich countries just because of their selfish will that they need oil power and right to keep their QOL average. They also cause damage and make earth cry so that abnormal climate changes and phenomenon happen recently. We should seriously consider about saving energy and source that scarcely exist on earth. Some associations and NGOs are making efforts but the top of the world doesn't correctly serve its main function. The world is always in someone's hand and under minority's envy. There is a notion so called minimalist, and I strongly believe that we must give a shot on it. We also should invent new technology that saves energy for green environment."
NBE06563,"I agree with Bill Gate's opinion. The climate problem must be solved by the countries discharging a large amount of carbon dioxide. They have to take the lead in reducing carbon emissions. And since I had an strong image of China as the polluting country, I was very surprised to know China had surged ahead of the US and Europe in green investment. And I also think the poor get poorer and rich get richer in capitalist system. For example, it costs much money to give children a good education. An well educated person could get a better paying job. Moreover when we start a business, we are required a capital. Sadly the rich have more chances to make money than the poor. I can accept the fact that most developed countries were also less optimistic when it came to agreeing with the statement ""the next generation will probably be richer, safer and healthier than the last"". But I think there is more room for prospering in developing countries."
NBE06747,I agree with your opinion that China has many problems. Pm2. 5 flows from China to Japan. I think we face a crisis of climate change. So I agree with Gate's ideas. Private sectors are very important for climate.
NBE07358,"I understand what Bill Gates was trying to say, but the world is under the system of capitalism for now and we have to seek ways to improve. Nothing will be solved if you criticize. However, it is true that developed countries are not doing enough and I think it is because people do not feel a sense of crisis. In fact, we are not having troubles or difficulties to lead our lives. I agree with the voices of surveys in the article. I also felt that countries with large populations should take the initiative to solve the environmental problem. Now, as discussed in the article, developed countries not only act in a corrupted manner but also help developing countries to become like them. For example, they introduce how to exploit a vast area in developed countries. We should find a way to coexist with nature."
NBE05414,"I agree with your idea. Even in Japan, there are still gaps between the rich and the poor, and there are some problems of social security. If we lose our job, it is difficult to back to the previous job. In addition, there are many problems of elderly people such as pension, medical services, nursing services, and also problems of young people such as child-rearing support. For example, the problems of a waiting children on the list, early-education and so on. Moreover, these days, the Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the Consumption Tax will be raised to 10% in April 2017. Consumption Tax is related to our dairy life, so we cannot be avoided and passed by sidestepped confusion. However, I think the increase of consumption tax is necessary. There are some reasons. First, until now, consumption tax has been covered half of the social security expenses, so if the consumption tax will be increased, the raising income of tax increased will be used for the stabilization of social security. That is to say, the tax increase will make our life better. The second reason is that the raising income of tax increased will make tax revenue become stable, so this will be connected to the Japanese economic growth. Comparing with other country, Japanese consumption tax is not so high. For example, Sweden, Denmark, Norway's consumption tax is 25% and this is the highest rates in the world. In addition, The Korea and China's consumption tax is higher than Japan. From these reasons, I think Japan should raise consumption tax. As this article shows, there are some environment problems such as dirty air and industrial pollution in the world. I also think not only the rich country but also the poor country ought to consider these problems and think the best way for the earth in the future."
NBE07359,"I was impressed with your opinion. It is true that we need to prepare money before thinking about what we can do with environmental issues. However, I do not have any ideas to help poor people getting poorer. The system gets so complex and even charity activities are not reliable. People has no or a little interest to each other and you might not notice if your neighbor dies alone. I think we need to fix not only the system but also the way people feel. I think reaching to a world where people can compassionate towards others is the closest way to solve any of worldwide issue."
NBE05670,"I think that we must not use fossil fuels. Because, fossil fuels is limit. And if we generate electricity by electricity with fossil fuel, then it exhausts carbon dioxide in large quantities. So, we should use green energy. Green energy has various kinds: solar energy and wind power or etc. . . But it costs much money to diffuse it. The future biggest problem will be a problem of the money. Therefore, Bill Gates contributed much money is very awesome thinking. I do not contribute like Bill Gates even if I had a lot of money. I will spend all money for oneself. However, he gave away all his money to charity. What is he going to do by the charity? I expect that he helps for making new energy. As well as it, he will help with the reduction of carbon dioxide. Increase in carbon dioxide on the earth is a serious problem. Temperature climbs into the earth year by year. We must stop the rise in temperature immediately. To that end, I hope that people thinking about society than oneself increase more. Even if we were not able to contribute the money, I separate it and I get into a hydrogen car and should think about environment."
NBE05759,"I think that the idea which the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies is right too. That's because I knew that there are children who cannot study enough due to poor in Japan through the TV program. Their family have to use their money for the livelihood, so they cannot use for the education. And, the children probably should work to live instead of studying for examination to enter universities. So, they cannot study enough and get a job with enough money. That is the vicious circle. We should break the circle. Otherwise, the gap between rich and poor become more and more spread. I would like Japanese government to make the useful plan to eliminate the disparities."
NBE05757,"I agree with your opinion. I also learned about the limit of fossil fuels, when I was a junior high and high school student. And the problem about CO2 emission is so serious. If the counties which emit much green gas emissions should not reduce it, the global warming will progress more and more. China and other countries should use resources effectively such as solar energy. And we Japanese also should reduce the CO2 emissions and make efforts to solve the environment problems."
NBE05756,"I agree with your opinion in the point that all countries should cooperative to solve the problem about CO2 emissions. When I saw the date about CO2 emissions, the US and China occupy 50% rate of all emissions in the world. However, China is not a developed country, so it is difficult to regulation. Even so, China should make an effort to reduce the CO2 emissions to solve this problem. We have to conceive the way how people of various positions agree with the issue. For that, I'd like to focus on the movement of each country."
NBE05758,"I agree with your opinion. I was surprised that Bill Gates spends $2 billion of his own wealth on green energy too. In the spring semester, we learned the news about the Picasso's picture. In that, we thought the how the rich should use their money. There are many ways, however, his act is one of the respectful ways. I think, the idea the poor get poor and the rich get richer in the capitalism society is right. So, the rich should have a broad vision, and conceive the poor and the whole society."
NBE05669,"I agree with Bill Gates. It is because that the global environment is serious now. How to deal with environmental pollution is a serious matter. You wrote that I had a strong image of China as the polluting country. I thought that too. China's image is very bad. There is very much quantity of China's exhaust gas. If thought of China does not change, the environmental problem is not solved. You think that the poor get poorer and rich get richer in capitalist system. It is true. But, I think that it is good. Because, the person does not grow up in the society that everybody is equal. If a person changed the social origin into does not appear, the earth will decline. In other words you should make a genius even if there is the difference. Because Nietzsche of a famous philosopher says, I think this to be right."
NBE06505,"I agree with Bill Gates' opinion about capitalism in the future. Now, unusual climate change and global warming and so on are a big problem all over the world. In the past, the US , the UK,Japan and others put national economic growth before the global environment. These countries did not completely take a global view of the environment. In the result, abnormal climate changes are more serious year by year. So, I think the order of priority of this issue is high. Also, when I read this article, I was quite expected that China has surged ahead of the U. S. and Europe in green investment despite remaining the world's most polluting country in terms of fossil fuels. And, I also think the poor get poorer and rich get richer in capitalist economy. This problem may be a natural consequence in capitalism. But, if the government do not stop the vicious downward spiral caused by the gap widening society, the gap between the rich and the poor will widens more and more. I think the education gap is especially very serious matter. Japanese government should cope with these problems to preserve capitalism and global environment."
NBE06506,"I agree with you. The system of capitalism that the poor get poorer and rich get richer may be natural result. But, the Japanese government should seek the improvement of the social security system to stop to widen the gap between the richer and poorer. And, the energy problem is serious all over the world. Not only rich countries but poor countries should cooperate in dealing with this issue in the future."
NBE05346,"I agree with your opinion. Recently in Japan, it is true that the poor gets poor and poor families are always in the negative chain. This serious situation in Japan is far from good, so everyone who live in Japan should think about this problem so deeply, and involve the Japanese government in this issue. I think Japanese people are one of the kindest and the most merciful people in the world, so they can think the problem as if it was his or her own one. Also, I felt that I should have also think about this problem deeply, and wanted to discuss it with my family, my friends, my future fellows."
NBE06862,"The environment problem is very serious in 21 century. Global warming is becoming more and more serious and the air consistence of CO2 is increasing from a long time ago, so we have to stop global warming. To stop global warming, I think it is important to develop clean energy because most of CO2 emissions comes from fossil fuel. We burn it and get gasoline, fuel oil, and also. Also we create energy from thermal power generation using fossil oil it is also discharge CO2. To use clean energy, it means we can stop to discharge these many CO2. This the most important I think. A weak point of clean energy is difficult to control volume of generate of electric but recently storage battery's technology is very progressed so we can solve this problem in near future I think. The cooperation between nations is also important. Last month COP21 was held in Paris and all over the countries made effective agreement about decreasing discharge of CO2 emissions. The point of this agreement, not only advanced countries but also developing countries have duty for decreasing CO2 emissions. From now, how decrease it from developing countries is very important for stop to global warming, also advanced countries support need for developing countries. We have to make efforts to stop global warming."
NBE06264,"I agree with the new survey: the poor get poorer and the rich get richer. In Japan, children in upper income family can go to cram schools, then they can enter high level schools through to university. Finally, they can get jobs in major company such as banks, trading firms and insurance companies. However, children in lower income family are hard to get such opportunities. Thus, this gap is brought by bap in education. Richer people should offer financial aid for lower income families to narrow the gap in education."
NBE06265,"I disagree with your opinion. Surely, investment gives opportunity for employment and employee get better wages than before. However, I think that they cannot become the real ""rich"". Because although employee's wage get better, they would not get extremely high wages or get a chance to take office as president. Additionally, during those period the rich would get richer. Thus, poor employee cannot catch up with the rich people."
NBE06564,"I agree with you. Income sometimes depends on whether we gave an enough education. Ironically, whether we can give an enough education depends on our parents' income. So, income disparity influences next generation. It needs money to give a enough education in order to be rich."
NBE07456,"I agree with your idea. It is true that Capitalism has large merits, for example everyone has chances to get money and be richer and people who make effort have high possibility to reward . But I think that this theory has not practiced. In fact, many employers use employees for a long time without break. Employers hire people low money, or do not pay their wages at the appropriate day. I often read these news in news paper . Originally, capitalism is a theory that every one has chances to get richer but in this economy there is no equality that everyone has chances . People who has educated well tend to get money and be richer. So I think we should take another look at this theory."
NBE06348,"I agree with the fact that capitalism, especially its competition makes benefits, improve our life. However, in the matter of environment, capitalism does not go well. If each country progress, the environment becomes worse. All countries and peoples want to get better life. So, we should think the meaning of ""progress "" and ""development "" again. We should not want materialistic development. We should hope the progress of QOL, peace of mind and environment. Change the direct of target in this capitalistic world."
NBE06232,"As you pointed out, ""powerful"" people like Bill Gates should express their thoughts about environmental problems. They will have a greater impact on many people around the world than ordinary people like us will do. Campaigns like such should be held more to solve environmental problems."
NBE06530,"I was surprised at two points when I read this article at first. First, I was surprised at the fact about capitalism. Bill Gates says that private sectors or individual can't solve energy problems, so big rich companies like his should deal with the problems. To be frank, I was a bid sad to be said such a thing. I believed that the criminal person who makes danger climate change was everybody in the world, so everybody was responsible to solve the problem and had to cooperate. Certainly, it may cost much money to reduce CO2 emissions and find new energy source and we can't create such a great deal of money. However, no matter what anyone says, I want to join to the approach and play a part as a member of the world. Second, I got a scare to China's green investment. I had known the fact that the deal of China CO2 emission is the most in the world, but I not known about China's act. Japanese including me often say that China pollutes our Asia and world irresponsibility because we don't know China's solar project well. I think Japanese should reflect on their past conduct and follow China's investment as the developed country."
NBE05909,"Hi! I found some point that I agree and not agree. "" I agree with Bill Gates's opinion that without a substantial carbon tax, there's no incentive for innovators or energy buyers to switch. "" - I agree with this opinion too. As an issue that we are familiar with, many super market introduce ""ECO point"". In this system, you can get some point when you use ECO bag. This system have something in common with a substantial carbon tax. I think this is good for incentive for innovators or energy buyers to switch. "" Now we are reaching the limit of cycle of growth in capitalism, I think. Capitalism is an economy system that is made up of making a large quantity of cheap goods in developing countries and selling in developed countries. However, as wages are being raised in developing countries these days, the advantage of price is lost, and then products will not be able to compete on the world market. "" - I agree with your thinking about capitalism, but I cannot agree with"" the limit of cycle of growth in capitalism"". As wages are being raised in developing countries these days, developed countries can find new larger market abroad. For example, Japanese companies of communications business aim at expansion for South America to establish a communications infrastructure in developing country. Thus, capitalism enters a new phase, and is growing now. "" I don't think that the poor are getting poor in Japan, because in Japan, a social security system like welfare is prepared. "" - I cannot agree with it. I think that Japan is still a society where educational record counts for a lot. Certainly, we can receive a scholarship, but there is a large difference between the people who is rich and enters a top-flight company and who is poor and is blue color worker for a life time. "" I can't be optimistic about the next generation's future in Japan, Especially population problem is serious, because the production-age population has been aging, and the young population has been decreasing. "" - I agree with your opinion so much. I think that young people including us must think about this problem seriously. We should make positive efforts to participate in politics. Bill Gates says that capitalism cannot save us from climate change View Post"
NBE07457,"I agree with your idea. The time when we concentrate on materialistic progress has ended. Now we have enough food and live in our homes safely and welfare is set minutely, so we should think about the quality of rights and equality. It is said that our country is peace and order , but we have a lot of problems about order, for example , aging society has progressed rapidly and institutions that the old come in are in short . As a result, the young who works at these institutions resorts to violence. Can we say the world which the young wounded the old peaceful? The answer is No. I think that this situation should change into both of generations cooperate with to solve problems that this world stands . This thinking also applies to the problem of environment. The developed countries for example USA , Australia, and Japan and so on has developed enough and has high technology. So if they decide not to use coals or heat power plant , we can make electricity by using another ways. On the other hand, developing countries for example India , South America , and so on do not have enough technology and money . If they decide not to use plants or machines that emit carbon dioxide, they will not make enough electricity to move factory. As I have stated above, developing countries are different from developed countries in money and technology. So we should pay attention to these differences thinking about environmental problems"
NBE06234,"I strongly disagree with your opinion. How can you say the more Chinese Japanese companies hire in their factories in China, the richer they become?Is the increase in the number of labor working there directly make their wage raised?I don't think so. Even if they get higher wage thanks to invested capital, we cannot overestimate the effect to be so great that China would drive Japanese factories out. The relationship between China and Japan describes as labor and capital will never change in that way. The chances are that Chinese corporations make good use of advanced technology imported from Japan to China, and benefit more efficiently. But I don't think the effect like you pointed out in your comment would happen. So I don't think the capitalism today will function in the way you mentioned."
NBE06775,"This article is too difficult for me to understand. But after I read this article, I have two thoughts of my own. First, I agree with Bill Gates's opinion. I think that we have reached the limit of growth in capitalism. That system is an economy system. Capitalism is the economic policy that established an important point in that people can make money by anyone by power of money and the resource freewheelingly without being disturbed in violence and social position. In other words, it is that capitalist and a person from company own a means of production and are the economic system which they let a worker work for their profit pursuit and produce. But these days, wages are tend to raising in developing countries. Then products will not be able to compete on the market all over the world. So, I think that almost innovators and energy buyers can't afford to turn a energy source that is using now to a new one because of climate change. Secondly, I think that the economic disparity opens and also think that ""the the poor get poorer and the rich get richer"". These days, Japan is gap-widening society. In addition, the difference is spreading and immobilizing. A parent is a person of upper class, their child tends to be a adult of upper class, and a parent is a person of down class, their child tends to be a adult of down class. If a parent is wealthy class, it is possible to employ a tutor and let their child go to the private supplementary school. And the child masters good results at school and advances to the first-class university and finds a job in the first-class company and earns money, and become wealthy class. If a parent is the poor, it is impossible to let their child go to school, especially a private school. Of course they cannot absolutely let their child go to the private supplementary school and employ a tutor. Then the child will fall into an education shortage, and will not be able to find a job in the good company, and become the poor. The true problems of the gap-widening society are immobilization of the income gap and immobilization of the hierarchies of a high income earner and the low-income person. The society that can support to the person who wants to find a job is an ideal. It is thought that there is room for the examination as for the system that the person who can make an effort can acquire higher qualifications in a shorter term. I think the society which supports the person who has motivation and makes an effort, even if the number of age is how many, even if trouble visits is ideal. But now, Japan is gap-widening society. So, I think that the government should cooperate with the company and the local, and support the person who does the best. For example, in elementary school and junior high school, small class should be realized. If small class will increase, children can learn deeply. The tuition of a public high school and the public university should be slashed. If the tuition will be cheap, poor children will be easy to get an education. In that way, regardless of a domestic income level, opportunity that receive high quality education will be expanded. For the member of society, vocational training should be expanded by unemployment insurance and an unemployment policy. And the program of the comeback to normal life should be arranged. I wish the gap between the rich and the poor will be disappeared."
NBE06773,"I agree with your opinion. As you say, the the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economics and the economic disparity opens. If parents have a lot of money, they can let their child go to the private supplementary school and let he or she go to the private school. Conversely, if parents are poor, they cannot let their child receive education enough. I think that we must cut off this negative chain of disparity. There are two points that I consider it as the method that I solve this problem. First, regardless of a domestic income level, for expanding opportunity that any children receive high quality education the small class should be realized in elementary school and junior high school. If small class will increase, children can learn deeply. The tuition of a public high school and the public university should be slashed. If the tuition will be cheap, poor children will be easy to get an education. Secondly, for the member of society, vocational training should be expanded by unemployment insurance and an unemployment policy. And the program of the comeback to normal life should be arranged. I wish the problem will be solved and the gap between the rich and the poor will be disappeared."
NBE06949,"I am agreeable for this article. Capitalism supports modern society, and it is certain that I contributed to development. In addition, I may not deny that a developed country and a big company sweep over the world using technology and economic power. Depending on capitalism, it is modern times, the present age in this way that I progressed. However, it is modern times, the present age that I get rid of an underdeveloped country and a worker while it progresses like that. Besides, I sacrificed it to existing various things on the earth. Nature, human relations, everything including the fuel is lost. As for the damage to give naturally so that it is touched by an article, awful. Agreements such as the carbon footprint business are concluded, and discharge is limited, and a sign of the improvement appears. However, human relations show adverse effects of the capitalism. The connection of a person and the person was abundant and valued the connection before. The human being exists as an individual, and the connection is thin now. It may be said that this is the worst event that capitalism brought. There may be us at a good opportunity to review capitalism."
NBE06774,"I disagree with your opinion. Certainly, in Japan, a social security system like welfare is prepared. But we can not supplement by it, so the poor get poorer and the rich get richer."
NBE06890,"I agree with you. I think the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economics too. Your statement that today's society attaches important to academic backgrounds aroused sympathy from me. In my opinion, the family finances influence children's academic background directly. If parents have much money, they could put their money into children's future by getting children taking private lessons and acquiring culture. As a result, children have much education. The following is illustrate what I think. Almost students of university of Keio have high adjusted deviation score. Everyone can't enter university of Keio. Students made efforts to enter it. I think the thing that supported them most is their parents. Of course, their parents cheered up them and made delicious dish for them. However, it was sure that the family finances contributed to their high adjusted deviation score most. Therefore, students maybe grew up in rich family. On the contrary, it isn't easy for children who grew up in poor family to enjoy high-quality education because they couldn't have the chance that they could learn something except school, for example cram school and swimming school. If you were born in rich family, it is easy for you to enjoy high-quality education. However, if you were born in poor family, it isn't easy for you to receive it. This circle is comfortable for rich people, but for poor people, it is just vicious circle. Unless the government stems this circle, rich people may get richer and poor people get poorer. I think the most important point in case of pursuing policies against this circle is whether poor people enjoy the blessings of them. It is no use that only rich people really feel the blessings of them. Actually, it takes a lot of times to get to benefaction to poor people, but if the government think about the future of the people and country seriously, I think it is valuable to invest a lot of times and money. I hope every child could enjoy high-quality education and my country become more affluent."
NBE05883,"The argument of Bill Gates is very interesting for me, because I am taking the natural science class in which I discuss the environmental and energy-technological matter with my classmates. In my opinion, the capitalism regarding environment comes to a turning point. In days go by, economy consisted of mass production and mass consumption, and companies needed to contribute to the prevention of the destruction of environment as they can possible in their production. In other words, the main point was thoroughly the production activity and the protection of green was secondary. But, now we have no choice but realize the limitation of capitalism, as Bill Gates and the public surveys pointed out. We must turn the direction toward the combination of economy and environment. We must think about them at the same time, as ""greenery production"". For example, there suggested ""emission right"" in the recent national business. The country which failed to achieve certain mark must pay money to ""buy"" the emission right from the one which succeeded. This system is exactly capitalistic, and environmental trade. In addition, I think it is possible for consumers to make companies contribute to the protection of environment well, such as volunteering and making less CO2 emissions. If they start to buy the eco-products as priority, thanks to the principle of market, the companies might also start to focus on them competitively. So we can improve the present situation made by capitalism, using the capitalism itself. Of course this is very difficult plan to achieve because the present economy system relying on fossil soil cannot change quickly. But I think we must to do so in the long run in order to do with the limited natural resources in the future."
NBE06653,"I think that modern capitalism reached to meet its demise. First of all, modern capitalism was formed in the 19th century's Industrial revolution period. But we can say that modern capitalism is not a perfect system. We can say it by looking at Russian Revolution in 1917. Modern capitalism is a system capitalists who have the tools of produce hire laborers to produce products. But profits by producing is monopolized by capitalists. So, the gulf between laborers and capitalists get deeper and deeper. And progress of globalization, the scale of market expanded to the whole world over. Therefore, present modern capitalism system can't catch up with the change of economy in recent years. Now that things have come to this pass, the gap between rich and poor. So, we should think alternative economical system that can be everyone equal."
NBE05882,"I have a different idea. Some developing countries such as India or China are occupying high rates of the entire CO2 emission of the whole world. So they are also responsible for the improvement to some extent. And, I think what is important for the future energy is ""energy mix"", using both natural resources and thermal, nuclear ones. Every energy has each good points or bad points. So we must use them effectively."
NBE06163,"I like Bill Gate's word in this sentence very much. It is ""The climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. China and the US and Europe have to solve CO2 emissions, and when they do, hopefully they'll make it cheap enough for everyone else. "" In recent years, global warming has become a world problem. And global warming is interlinked with climate change because global warming changes the patterns of the weather world-wide. Climate change can cause serious problems for wild animals. Furthermore, it has a significant impact on food production. Concern for these climate change problems has been growing in recent years on a global scale. Therefore, the issue of global warming is important on a global scale and must be addressed over the long-term. So, it is crucial to support measures taken by rich countries to cope with climate change. Have people in rich countries ever thought about global warming? Climate change is a global problem and they live in a global environment. This is because tackling climate change and living of people must be compatible. Therefore, I felt that every single person must reconsider global warming. For example, if people wear cooler clothes in their offices during the summer, they can turn down their air-conditioners and, as a result, help to reduce global warming. So, It is very important that deepening the understanding of the general public concerning the current situation of global warming and the importance of global warming countermeasures."
NBE06162,"I agree with your opinion. I think climate problem must be solved by developed countries, the countries discharging a large amount of carbon dioxide. However, the developed countries do not want to cooperate with the developing countries very much. In addition to this, there are the problems created in the international community by the differences between developed countries and developing countries. Both of them are worldwide important matters. Moreover, measures against poverty problems and widening income inequality are insufficient. So, a global crisis requires a global solution. I am sure the developing world and the developed world can solve climate change problem and economic disparity by helping each other. And it is very important thing for people of developed countries to think what they can do in order to help people of developing countries."
NBE05760,"I understood your theory. However, I do not know if I agree with you. I think, the really poor can not have the will that they want to study in order to enter the university. The poor you assume are who enter the university by using the scholarship. But, there are children who must work to live. Of course, they have their dream and they might want to learn. As a practical matter, however, there are families can not live by their own income. As you said, the opinion that the poor can be rich is also the fact. However, that need their strong will and lack. For example, they need monetary aid and understanding of the surrounding. Compared to it, the rich can be rich easier. Both of the poor and the rich have opportunities, but it is never equal. So, I think, the opinion that ""The poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies"" is right on the whole."
NBE06164,"I'm opposed to your opinion. Of course, I think it is important that the person who has power like Bill Gates say his or her opinion. However, I wonder it's just enough. I think it is important that more people advocate. About China's environment problems, I agree with your opinion. The environment problems that China is facing are serious and varied, and are large in scale. With the economic growth, resources and energy consumption has rapidly increased to create environmental problems. So, each of Chinese people must strive to solve the country's environmental problems. And it seems to be important for Japan to utilize its technological capabilities, its experience in dealing with energy and environmental problems, and so forth to contribute to resolving the issues that China is facing."
NBE06596,"I disagree with your opinion. There is some truth in what you say. However capitalism is not eternal but circular. Once upon a time China was called 'the world's factory'. Corporations founded factories to seek cheap labor. China developed temporally, but when companies left China for other countries to seek cheaper labor, China began to decline gradually. When Chinese workforce became cheaper, corporations founded factories again. In this way the capitalism circulates around the world."
NBE07427,"I think this article is so difficult. Before I read it, I wonder the title of it. Why the capitalism cannot save us from climate change? I do not know the meaning. But, I sympathized this sentence. ""The poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies. "" I think this means the bad side of capitalist economies. The capitalism has two kinds of people. These are capital and labor. A capital is the leader of his company and it is under the command of him. So, of curse capitals are the rich and labors are the poor. This happens the difference of people and society. The presidents of their companies hope they will become bigger and advance into foreign market. I think this causes climate change. Most of big companies may influence the environment of the earth. By the way, I was surprised at the fact of surging ahead of China's green investment. My impression of China is many population and terrible air pollution. In contrast to my thoughts, China is going ahead with the construction of power stations of solar. To stop greenhouse gas emission, I think the best mean is the change of the source of fuels. For example, there are solar power generation system, hydraulic power generation geothermal power generation and so on. Solar power generation is the most efficient generation and so low cost. I like it and many families in the world try to install it on their houses' roof. This helps cutting off their cost of electricity and stopping global warming. I think more countries and families should introduce it."
NBE05526,"I agree with your opinion. I think all countries should share information about pollution too. For example, I have had a image which China is country wasting energy. However, in reality, China has been using resources effectively. If I don't read this article, I will not know the truth forever. In addition, I was surprised that other country such as Germany and the United Kingdom has been working for reducing CO2 emissions. Japan also should emulate these countries. I hope that many countries have the consciousness which make it eco-friendly and we can live not to harm the earth. Although the environment problem is very serious in 21 century, this situation was created by people. So, it is necessary for us to take responsibility. The policy of the country is important , but each person's consciousness is more important. Let's cooperate together so that a global environment improves!"
NBE06470,"Bill Gates is right, and I think that the capitalism destroys environment. The company which is driven by production in the capitalism demands a profit. The company produces a large quantity of products to get a profit and originates the latest product in sequence again and distributes it. Speed to release a new product in the world increases year by year in the present age and the energies consumed to suffer from production continue increasing. In this situation it is obvious that energy of the earth dries up. Should I remember Japanese traditional mind ""saving""and ""mottainai"" now? And the construction of the system of the really sustainable economy that is not capitalism and not communism will be necessary."
NBE06652,"I disagree with your opinion. Although, investment gives opportunity for employment and employee get higher wages than past. However, I think that they cannot become the genuine ""rich"". Because even though employee's wage get higher, they would not get extremely high wages or get a chance to take office as president. Moreover, during those period the rich would get wealthier. In addition, poor employee cannot catch up with the wealthy people. By looking at these point, the gap between rich and poor expands more and more."
NBE07045,"The world cooperates these days to reduce greenhouse gas to stop the progress of the global warming. Two methods called cap and trade and the baseline credit were adopted in the Kyoto Protocol. This method was concrete and effective left splendid results in Germany and Japan. After Copenhagen meeting of COP15 and Mexican meeting of COP16, developing countries and developed countries set the target of the greenhouse gas reduction and were on agreement afterwards. The world finally became one and became able to solve the issue of global warming that swung between many developed countries which were going to control the emission of the greenhouse gas and developing countries to give priority to economic development. I think that there are many people who insist that global warming is progressing and we must stop it in spite of there being such actions of world nations. They only worry people. We should not sound an alarm bell of the global warming and first of all should check world actions to global warming and think about solutions. Sadly in spite of such a world action, the quantity of carbon dioxide emission continues increasing. The private sectors surely causes the global warming as Bill Gates said. It is difficult to make them reduce the quantity of the CO2 emission of the private sector while interest exists. I think that the government should intervenes in a private sector and make numeric data visible, then concrete ways to reduce emissions of the CO2 of the private sector can be found. I think that to grope for concrete solutions than to criticize the current capitalist system is very constructive. ""A majority of respondents from seven countries said that the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies"" this article said. It is surely certain that some people have vast property in capitalist society. However, do the Japanese citizens have the impression that more and more people suffering from life because of poverty? I don't have and maybe most of people don't have because social welfare system is established well. Switzerland of the first place on well-being ranking is the same. I think that it becomes a key to get rid of a gap between the poor and the rich to establish social welfare systems well."
NBE07138,"The problem written by this article is one of the most important problems now at all over the world. The problem argued very intensely in COP21. I think a developing nation as well as an advanced should also do an effort of reduction in greenhouse gas. Because the amount of the greenhouse gas which occurs in case of financial development is a huge one. When establishing a reduction target, a developing nation would consider a supply source of the new energy for growth. I think it can develop into the environment financially well when doing that."
NBE06379,"The climate change assumes gradually a serious aspect. There is a lot of argument about this problem, and many of countries are coming to grips with it. However, it is taking a great deal of times to improve. Even if some countries make an effort to solve the climate change, it does not mean if other countries do not cooperate to solve together. Nevertheless, I know developing countries need energy sources to be developed their own economy, but we will lose both principal and interest if people will not be able to live on earth by the climate change because of the destruction of an environment. Many countries are inflicting damage to the environment for a profit and expansion of countries. However, the more people inflict damage the environment, the more life of the earth are shortening. Bill Gates said that especially China, the US and Europe have to solve CO2 emissions, but Japan also has to work together to save the earth and our living as one of the developed countries. In addition, it announced that Bill Gates spend two billion dollars of his own wealth on green energy, and he insisted that an individual investors is the very helpful people to solve the problem. It is not a duty, but I hope any investors to fellow him, and I thought it is great that he leads actively from the front to settle of a problem."
NBE07394,"I agree with the idea that capitalist, like Bill Gates, try to make environment better positively. There are many problems like not only global warming but also the shortage of resources. For thousands of years, the population of the world increased gradually. Then, in the middle nineteenth century, the world's population started to rise rapidly. In the 100 years between 1830 and 1930, the population of the world grew from 1 billion to 2 billion people. By 1960, just thirty years later, the world's population had hit 3 billion. Fifteen years later, the population reached 4 billion. Then, a mere eleven years later, there are 5 billion people on earth. In 1999, we passed the 6 billion mark. Today, the world's population grows by 76 million people every year. By the year 2050, researchers predict that the population of the world will be 9.1 billion. Does the earth have the natural resources to support this many people? Unfortunately, the answer tooth's question depends on information we do not have. For example, we do not know how people will choose to live in the future. We do not know what their standard of living will be. We also do not know what new technologies will be available in future. We do know that the Earth's natural resources are limited. Fresh water, for example, is crucial for health and food production. However, more than 97% of the water on Earth is salt water, which is poisonous to both people and crops. Only 3% of the water on Earth is fresh water, and three quarters of that fresh water is frozen at the North and South Poles. Today, the demand for fresh is greater than the supply in roughly eighty countries around the world. By 2025, scientists predict that forty eight countries will have chronic shortages of water. At present, desalinization, or the removal of salt from salt water, is not a solution to the shortage of fresh water. Intakes a lot of energy to remove the salt from ocean water, and that makes the desalinization process very expensive. The amount of land we can use to produce food is also limited. Today, roughly 11% of the land on Earth can be used for crops, while another 20% is available for raising animals. Each year, however, more this land is lost as cities grow and roads stretch across the land. In addition, over cultivation has already damaged an amount of farmland equal to the size of the United States and Canada combined. It is impossible to increase the amount of farmland, but only a little. Some farmland can be more productive if people start using different farming methods, but this will not increase worldwide production very much. Clean air is another important natural resource. However, it too is Threatened by the growing population. The average person today puts about 1.1 metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere each year. Most of it comes from burning fossil fuels, gasoline, coal, oil, wood, and natural gas. Scientist say that the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air is already 18% higher than it was in 1960. What effect would 3 billion more people have on the air we breathe? While we have many different sources of energy, there is a limited supply of many of them. Today, most of the world's energy comes from three non-renewable resources, petroleum, natural gas, and coal. Three quarters of this energy is used by developed countries. As the standard of living goes up in other countries, so will the demand for the energy. Some scientists predict that if everyone in the world lived like an American, our fossil fuel supply would last for just fifteen more years. Clearly, the number of people that the Earth can support in the future will depend on many things. The Earth may be able to support 9 billion people, but what will their standard of living be? And what effect will all these people have on the environment? In this situation, each people should do his best to protect our environment and Capitalist's action can be key to achieve this purpose especially, I think."
NBE06407,"I think that capitalism cannot save us from climate change. I think of this theme these days and we have to think about this problem. I think that capitalism is too much in one sense. First, in capitalism, to provide anything and to use anything last forever and the term 'Mottainai' was disregarded as nonsense. And capitalism was not sustainable and company must earn money and the result was decided by the money one earned. All the value was judged according to money. This pattern of capitalism always lead to the destruction of nature. To get wood and the place for cultivating land, people cut the forest and the evolution of modern world was connected with the destruction of nature. Capitalism break the traditional value and disregard this as cheap. Mass consumption is regarded as the value. Commodity was thrown away if it don't work well. People who live in modern world don't repair and don't have the thought to use anything over and over again. This is connected to the destruction of nature. Because this cause the mass consumption. The more People uses the money, the company can get more money and this is the characteristic of capitalism. I think that nature and capitalism cannot coexist. . So let's look at the meaning of capitalism. ' an economic system in which investment in and ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange of wealth is made and maintained chiefly by private individuals or corporations, especially as contrasted to cooperatively or state-owned means' It just illustrates the system. But we have to think abut the capitalism. Does capitalism made people happier? Are there no people who cry by the problem of money? So now is the time to use Mottainai to pass on beautiful earth to next generation and create a beautiful world."
NBE05552,"At first, I can't understand this article well. This article was a little difficult for me to understand. I'll write about some points picked up from this article. First, I'm going to talk about the statement of Bill Gates. I found that I agree with him, and also disagree with him. The point that I agree is that a substantial carbon tax may encourage innovators or energy buyers to start working for carbon dioxide emission reduction. He said, "" Without a substantial carbon tax, there's no incentive for innovators or energy buyers to switch. "" This may be right. For sure, a carbon dioxide emission is still big. So imposing a new tax on CO2 emission can be an effective way to decrease it. On the other hand, the point I disagree is that the problem of CO2 emission should be solved in the rich countries. Of course, developed countries are responsible for the climate problems. That is the fact we cannot doubt. But, only developed countries can't solve the problems. They should be tackled all over the world. The example is measures to illegal destruction of forests in the Amazon. In this way, there are problems which can't be solved in only rich countries. Second, I'm going to talk about the capitalism. This article said the capitalism is criticized by two sources, Bill Gates and a new survey showing that the public have doubts about capitalism as well. The former did from the viewpoint of environmental protection and the latter did from the viewpoint of economy in the world. I described the former in previous paragraph. So I think about the latter. In this capitalistic economy, in fact, the poor get poorer and the rich get richer. This phenomenon is to be generated by all means in the capitalistic world. But the poor isn't necessarily continuing to be poor. The poor have a chance to be rich. To do so, the poor will have to be educated more. The rich have to support the system the poor get proper education. Then, I think the compliant about the capitalism will decrease. This article mentioned two attack for capitalism. It is very difficult to consider what the capitalism should be. Is the capitalism good for us, or bad for us? I think the capitalism is good, but should be improved. From this article, the compliant was appeared, so we should tackle to make capitalism better."
NBE05854,"I believe that developed countries' government had better try to shift economic fabric of society without fossil fuels little by little. However, I think we must try to shift non-carbon life in order to not solve global warming but keep the level of our life for a long time. The leaders of developed countries these days realize that global warming is big problem. On the other hand, the leaders have not made sufficient solutions for stopping global warming. However, is global warming really big problem? If it is warm everywhere, the areas of eternal summer get larger and larger. Southern countries' fruits can grow in northern countries. Although some islands which have the very low height sink the sea, human beings can live in the place where cannot live due to the heavy cold. Even if all human beings can live as same as until now, warm climate makes us comfortable. In one southern country, the kind of words like ""Cheer up!"" or ""Go for it"" does not exist because fruits fall down from trees naturally if someone just lies on hammock. I hope to live like this and many people envy it. Therefore, although global warming is regarded as just evil thing by many people in modern society, I strongly believe that global warming have both aspects of good and bad. By the way, fossil fuels will dry up soon. So, we must try to shift little by little non-carbon life without fossil fuels. It is essential for us to use energy. If fossil fuels dried up, we could not keep the level of our life. In that time, in order to keep the level of our life, we must progress the technology of green energy. In conclusion, global warming has both aspects of good and bad. Also, we must progress the technology of green energy in order to keep the level of our life for a long time."
NBE05553,"I disagree with you in that you think that if developed countries start to tackle the problem of CO2 emission, the climate problems will be solved. Of course, developed countries should try to solve them, like decreasing CO2 emission. But that only doesn't makes it possible to solve them. The climate problems are the world's problems. So they should be tackled all over the world. For example, the illegal deforestation has happened in the Amazon too often. Only developed countries can't cope with such a thing."
NBE06305,"I somewhat agree with Bill Gates. Now the richer the countries are, the more they consume energy sources. Capitalism itself is good thing. Many countries include Japan introduce capitalism. On the other hand , it can make earth environment go worse. Discharging Carbon Dioxide is typical example. In China , so many cars are used for transportation. It promote environmental problems. To stop climate change, rich countries must reduce CO2 emissions and willing to introduce green energy."
NBE06306,I strongly agree with you. Man in power like Bill Gates has influence on society. Their opinions can move many people in right directions to make green environment. Sometimes This kind of influence is bigger than one nation opinion.
NBE05855,"I don't agree with your idea. Precisely, is global warming including CO2 emission really big problem? If it is warm everywhere, the areas of eternal summer get larger and larger. Southern countries' fruits can grow in northern countries. Although some islands which have the very low height sink the sea, human beings can live in the place where cannot live due to the heavy cold. Even if all human beings can live as same as until now, warm climate makes us comfortable. In one southern country, the kind of words like ""Cheer up!"" or ""Go for it"" does not exist because fruits fall down from trees naturally if someone just lies on hammock. I hope to live like this and many people envy it. I strongly believe that global warming has both aspects of good and bad."
NBE06749,"I was surprised that Bill Gates spends $2 billion of his own wealth on green energy and asked his fellow billionaires to help make the fossil-free by 2050 with similar philanthropy. I agree with your idea that this social system make a big gap between rich people and poor people because if someone lose his or her job in the capitalism society. In this society, poor person is poor more and more, and the rich person becomes richer and richer. However, I think it is good for the world that some capitalists like Bill Gates spend money for the human. It is reason that the money gathers to a rich person because a rich person turns the economy. Therefore I am agreeable in private sectors."
NBE07021,"Global Climate Change is not a climatic concern, but an economic issue. By creating conditions that diminish profit in developed countries, business capital will migrate to areas of the world that international consensus determines to be in need of economic development. Although the notion of anthropomorphic climate change has been widely dismissed by serious, non-politically funded entities, the push to limit the ability to produce a product in developed countries will continue and expand under the guise of international law. Those who actually believe in the nonsensical idea espoused by Bill Gates are part of the United States. They also are willing and unwilling participants in Global Economic Change, which is the actual agenda of this political and economic movement."
NBE05581,"I am of the opinion that we should create energy by nuclear fusion reactor of the next generation. I am sure that with this technology we can also solve the problem of climate change that Bill Gates worried. Fusion reactor is a type of nuclear reactors under development, those utilizing a nuclear fusion reaction. Practical use in the second half of the 21st century is one of the emerging technologies that are expected. As the fuel of nuclear fusion, use the deuterium and tritium is the isotope of flammable hydrogen by lightly. When fusing the nuclei of deuterium and tritium, you can helium and neutrons. In this case, than the sum of the weight of the previous reaction deuterium and tritium, lighter is more of the total weight of helium and neutrons were able after the reaction, this lightly became minute of energy is being released. In response, enormous energy is generated from a small amount of fuel, for example, 1 grams of deuterium - You can obtain the corresponding energy to petroleum from tritium fuel equivalent to that of one of the tank truck (about 8 tons). Fusion reactor technology I think some people are worried that not dangerous. But fusion reactor is safe. In the reactor, which is currently operating, it makes use of the nuclear fission reaction. In nuclear fission, and power generation energy heavy atomic nuclei such as uranium and plutonium occurs when you divide the light nuclei to absorb the neutrons is taken out in a nuclear reactor. In addition to this so that safety is ensured, there are two further advantages. Deuterium which is a raw material of nuclear fusion in one eye There are many in the sea. Therefore it is not worried about the resource is depleted. It is still good for the environment. In the process of power generation, it does not produce carbon dioxide that causes global warming. High-level radioactive waste is not generated."
NBE06349,"I agree with your opinion. When I was a school girl, I lived in Nagoya. And just that time, COP10 was held in Nagoya, we participate in the gathering. So I experienced such thing, after that , I am interested in environmental problems. So I am very worried about environmental problems, and now global warming is surely moving up to worst direction. We , all over the world not only unit of nation but also unit of the nation and especially the nation who live in industrially developed nation , should make an effort to reduce CO2. Therefore famous people like Bill Gates maintain such thing will affect our life and change our future."
NBE05932,"This article is difficult for me because the story is too long and too boring. But after I read this news article , I noticed that I was interested in this news article. In this news , there are sentence that ""Bill Gates, has said that the private sector is too selfish and inefficient to produce effective energy alternatives to fossil fuels"" and "" Without a substantial carbon tax, there's no incentive for innovators or energy buyers to switch. Since World War II, US-government R&D has defined the state of the art in almost every area. The private sector is in general inept. The climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. China and the US and Europe have to solve CO2 emissions, and when they do, hopefully they'll make it cheap enough for everyone else. "" I agree with his idea. There many problems like not only global warming but also shortage of resource. We should solve this problem, I think."
NBE05826,"I think what Bill Gates says is basically true. I think that private sector is kind of selfish and inefficient to produce effective energy alternatives to fossil fuels. And I think he is great because he is not a kind of person who only says his opinion but he is a person with great action. I know he is a great person, because I have seen him done a lot of charity and donations with Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. His company known as Microsoft has donated a lot of money when the Tohoku Earthquake occurred. He has been considering about poor people and those who lives under poverty. In his quotes he mentions that the climate change has to be solved in the rich countries, and after that it should be cheap enough for everyone else to use. I think he is saying totally right thing. Basically developed countries have the money to invest and advanced technology. So they should benefit other countries by doing what they can, because that is what makes everyone's life happy. It is surprising to know that China has surged ahead of the US and Europe in green investment, though it is the world's most polluting country in terms of fossil fuels. Because in my opinion China was the last country to do green investment. I know how much they need to start using green energy, since I have a friends from Shanghai in Keio university and she told me once that you cannot really live in Beijing because of the air pollution. There is one more hit for capitalism as an economy in this article. It is the survey concluding the poor get poorer and the rich get richer. Even if it is true, I think it is something you cannot change, because it happens all the time. Smart people get smarter, and as with the same, rich people get richer in this world. But I feel a need to solve this problem in some way."
NBE06714,"Bill is right in some aspects. I mean, capitalism has limit because it is consist of competition. Competition is really useful tools to generate something new but it is not good at eliminate something, shave something. However, I think, capitalism is changing gently from short-term capitalism to long-term capitalism. If companies want to get money in long term, they have to think about making profit eco-friendly. It is kind of advanced capitalism. The change is caused to existence of ""company"" and global financial system. Now, there are many companies that have long history more than 100 years. And numerous money are finding place to fund in long-term. I mean, company tends to live longer than people and owner of company is get to think about sustainable growth. For example, consumable companies need growth global population. At least, they want steady market that doesn't shrink. So what should they do? I think they have to develop developed countries and make them grow. I mean, they have to make new market. This process is not like capitalism because it is amazingly long-term but some great companies do this. Google is one of these companies. They research the way of connecting people in poor countries to the Internet. Of course, it doesn't make profit in 5 to 10 or more years. Google want to do that because they want to expand the areas of their market, users. Sustainable growth in hundreds years request eco-friendly business because it needs management resources in the future. Briefly, I can understand what Bill thinks but it's not true. He is in IT industry and it's really short-term business, so he doesn't have great view of so long-term business."
NBE06686,"It is difficult problem to solve. Because there is a gap between a developed country and developing country about environmental problem. The former will not increase rapidly, but the latter will increase possibly. So if the former propose new rule that restricts CO2 emission, the latter discourage the former from passing it. Because the latter wants to grow if even environment of nation or all over the world is destroyed. The latter think the former did the same thing in the past, so the latter think to have right developing own country. However, in the capitalism, the rich people become rich. The poor people become poor theoretically. Because the rich people's children can take the education of high quality and have powerful connection. The other hand, the poor people have to take the education of low quality and don't have powerful connection. This is a social problem among people. Needles to say, this problem can apply to nations. To put it in a different way, the rich countries keep to the rich countries. The poor countries end up being the poor countries in the capitalism. Therefore if a conflict between the former and the latter continues, I think it is difficult to solve. And we can't break the present circumstances in the world. We can't solve the environment problem and the problem of the gap the rich and the poor. So I agree with Bill Gates. I think capitalism cannot save us from climate change. After I read this article, more and more strong I think it."
NBE07072,"I think ""the poor get poorer and the rich get richer"" is right. Because now in Japan, basically people who have a lot of money can receive good education. It becomes slightly easy to get a stable job in the future if received good education. Even if under the capitalism, all people should receive the good education equally. The government should solve this problem. I think equal capitalist society is such a system. And I'm agree with Bill Gates' opinion ""Without a substantial carbon tax, there's no incentive for innovators or energy buyers to switch. "" and ""The climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. China and the US and Europe have to solve CO2 emissions"" The current development country exhausted a large quantity of CO2 with the industrialization in the past. I think that we should take responsibility for solving this problem as soon as possible! If we put it off, we can not solve this problem forever."
NBE06918,"I also knew that Japanese social media reports only one side of Chinese environmental problem. Unless Japanese read this news, we will misunderstand China is the country which continue to pollute a huge amount of CO2 emissions. In this time, I recognize the industrialized countries such as China, German, and US started to make an effort to decrease CO2 so we can expect that the countries all over the world will solve this environmental problem in the future. And I hope Japan is the top country that contributes to lower CO2 emissions in the world."
NBE06919,"When I read this news at first, I was surprised at knowing China have been making an effort to decrease CO2 emissions. That is because I image the industrialized countries, especially China, have no interest in lower CO2 emissions. In Japanese mass media, China tends to be reported to remain the world's most polluting country in terms of fossil fuels. So I think Bill Gate's idea is great. While the only poor countries which produce less CO2 emissions tackling the CO2 problem hardly, unless the rich countries which utilize the huge amount of CO2 take some actions to solve the problem, The effort of the former countries result in nonsense. So like his idea the climate problem such as CO2 emissions should be solved in both poor and rich countries."
NBE06128,"I was surprised when I read this news at first time. I believe that capitalism is great system. However there are a lot of people with various opinion in the world. Many developed countries which are almost capitalism. In particular, Japan is a rich country. And we would be satisfied to become rich. However Sometimes the rich countries have to trouble to other countries. Its representative is a global warming. Developed countries were allowed to develop the industry in order to become rich, so carbon dioxide emissions from developed countries. Developed countries are also use natural energy, but it is a fact that developed countries emission of carbon dioxide. Moreover I was surprised at the price of 2 trillion. Huge amount of money, I think that person should be considered well how to use. Furthermore I was surprised that China is focusing on the development of natural energy. And I think that European countries because they reduced emissions of carbon dioxide. I feel that there are many people who think about environmental problems in the world."
NBE07292,"When I read this article for the first time, I was very impressed. In Japan, there is a serious problem. It is great gap about income. If a family does not have money, the child who was raised will be poor. In the future, Japan will be aging society. Our generation who is eighteen to twenty years old have to support this aging society. Indeed, we have no choice to avoid aging society. But we have to consider and think solution. First, we have to have money to help the old. So the government have to raise the income. This solution is hard for the small and medium-sized enterprise. But to think the future society, this solution must be conducted I think. Second, I think the government must take some activity. For example, to support to help the countryside people. In the urban city, there are many good infrastructures and a home for the old. On the other hand, in the rural society, there are few home for the old. Indeed, in the rural society people support each other. But If the old died in his house, possibly no body can notice this situation. So the Japanese government have to support this point."
NBE07205,"I'm with your opinion that people should feel that the crisis is coming. We feel as if terrorism and the attacks were the foreign affairs and they would never come to Japan. However, we can't foresee the future and it is always unsure. We have to be careful and look at what is going on around the world like what the attacks in Paris mean to us and to the world order. The developing countries need initiative and support of developed countries like The United States and Japan. We have to be their role models, which means that the government should act correctly. It also means that the citizens must consider whom we vote. When we provide developing countries with new technology, history, nature and culture of that area should necessarily be taken into account."
NBE07233,"More developed countries were less optimistic when it came to agreeing with the statement The next generation will probably be richer, safer and healthier than the last. """" I was really interested in this part of the article. It seems that developed countries is giving up capitalism. But when we see the India, most of them are believing ""The next generation will probably be richer, safer and healthier than the last"". What makes this difference? First of all, there is the gap of power of economy . Developed countries are very wealthy and they may be able to buy anything they want. Though this is exaggeration, they're are at least fulfilled materially to some extent . If a man contents with his life, he never want to work, or even think. The Developed countries ""giving up"" is just like this. They are content with what they are. I think this is good. Only Developed countries can such feeling. But like India, developing countries are ""developing"". They always think how they can win developed countries, how defeat developed countries, how put developed countries under them, how wonderful it would be if they could achieve such beautiful world. To give up capitalism is 'good'. But if developed countries give up capitalism, who call them ""Developed Countries""? So, criticize capitalism is good. But they must not give up capitalism, I think. If they give up capitalism, next may be the era of India and China or other countries. That's my thought."
NBE07268,"At first I thought that we must change to use other powers. Because, fossil fuels have the limit and if we make power by electricity with fossil fuel, then it makes much more carbon dioxide emissions, I think. So, I think that we should use green energy. Green energy has great variety. For example water power and solar power and wind power and so on. But it costs much money to use them. In the future, a problem of the money may be the biggest burden and most important topic. So, Bill Gates contributed much money is very wonderful action, I think. I may be able not to contribute like Bill Gates even if I had a lot of money and I will spend all money for me or my family. But, he gave away all his money to charity. What a man who give one's all money away for charity! I think that he must be generous man and I respect him after hearing this news. I wish that he helps for making new energy. And I wish that he will help with the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions too. Now, increase in carbon dioxide on the earth is a serious problem . Temperature climbs into the earth year by year. I think we must stop the rise in temperature immediately. Even if we were not able to contribute the money, I separate it and I get into a hydrogen car and should think about environment. And I want to spread a opinion to think more seriously about decreasing carbon dioxide all over the world. If we don't think it individual, its problem will attack our descendant. And its problem will become much more bigger than now, I think. This situation is very dangerous and difficult to improve, so we should think and spread and act! At first, I will reduce to use air-conditioning to decrease carbon dioxide emissions. And I will try not to waste to take a shower and watch TV and so on."
NBE07234,"I agree with your opinion. To share information is the most important when do communication. In the past, to share information or knowledge needed very complicated process to be done. Because all process was the work of human. All human are living thing, and all of them have some problems. More people relate the conveying of information, more troubles may happen. But we are now living the era of IT. We can access many kinds of information immediately. This is also helping the communication of countries. To share information have become much easier than the past. If people themselves make a little more effort, world may become better place for us much easier than before, I think."
NBE06053,"Surely, I don't think it is impossible that the poor becomes rich. But I don't agree with you. Now I think the means is also very difficult. To go to good school, It is difficult to pass an examination without going to the private supplementary school and it cost much money to go to the private supplementary school. So for all the poor, it is not easy. There is the scholarship, but there are few numbers in Japan and it cannot be surely said that all poor people have a chance. First I wish what these expand."
NBE07071,"I also think all people in the world should share the information about pollution. The countries which emit a lot of CO2 should have a sense of shame that ""Does our country exhaust carbon dioxide so much?"" All country, including Japan should consider more about climate change and compete each other."
NBE06199,"Bill Gate's action is very grateful and nobody act as Bill Gate. His opinion makes sure. However, it is not real. I have thought him realist even. He started Microsoft and created Windows OS. He has a great head for business. Using it, he became the top of millionaires. So, I thought that his idea was real very much. I believe that fossil fuels are essential in modern society. If fossil fuels are exhausted, our society will collapse. Renewable energies not being supplied much can't support our society. Finally, fossil fuels are only generator supporting our life for the present. About the distant future, we will have the solution of energy problem. It is nuclear fusion. Now it is technologically difficult to use nuclear fusion, but we mostly generate energy by nuclear fusion in future. Bill Gate should invest not renewable energy but nuclear fusion. However, I don't say renewable energy is no useful. I say renewable energy don't become main energy source in our society and we should develop nuclear fusion more primarily than renewable energy. If I were Bill Gate, I will invest not renewable energy but nuclear fusion."
NBE07291,I agree with your opinion deeply. It is usual that there are many poor families. But the government did not take proper manifest. And we have to think this problem deeply.
NBE06200,"I agree with your opinion. Nowadays, Japan is very dangerous. Rich men's children become rich for good. Poor men's children become rich for good. In ancient there are a lot of middle in Japan. However, it begins to collapse. If current working generation retires, Japan won't have working men and don't move economical differentials. Old people have a lot of money and don't use the money. Young people have a little money. The worst situation is that a gap-widening society completes and young men don't have wishes, go out Japan to foreign countries. Japan can't return even Japan and there are no rich men in Japan. So, I think that Japan should know limit of current capitalism and consider correcting current capitalism"
NBE05963,"After I read this article I thought some opinions. First, I agree with Bill Gates. I also think that without a substantial carbon tax, there is no incentive for innovators or energy buyers to switch. Now we are reaching the linnet of limit of cycle of growth in capitalism and we are noticing about that. Capitalism is the system that developing countries are making a large quantity of cheap goods and selling them to developed countries. But now the wage of developed countries is rising so the system is difficult to keep. Other opinion is that in this system rich people are getting more rich and poor people are getting more poor. Finally, population problem is serious. This is because the production age population has been aging and the young population has been decreasing. We should be think about it more seriously."
NBE05964,I agree with your opinion. You have some good points. You know well about the negative points of the capitalism. and what I would like to say is all included in your opinion.
NBE05698,"CO2 problem is no longer one of the most serious global problems now. As the industry has developed, the amount of CO2 emission which is emitted by using fossil fuels has increased. It has effect not only on the climate change but also people's health. The meeting about this issue has been held several times and each country set the goal of the amount of CO2 emission, but most countries cannot accomplish it. Therefore, this Bill Gate's action can be a big chance to consider the environment, because he is the world's richest man, so his actions and opinions are influential and attract people's attention. It could make people notice that it is time to set about this problem seriously. I was surprised at speech, 'There's no fortune to be made', but he is a billionaire, that is the reason that he can take this decisive measures spending 2 billion dollars of his own wealth on green energy. I agree with Bill Gate's speech at the point that we should make effort for declining the amount of CO2 emission and developed countries take a leadership. In fact, China nowadays has invested in green emission and China's solar energy rose 67 per cent between 2013 and 2014, and as a result, the country's CO2 emissions decreased 1 per cent in 2014. However, I don't think that capitalism make CO2 increased. Indeed, most polluting countries in terms of fossil fuels take capitalism, but I think it is not because of capitalism but because of a corrupt manner of the big companies."
NBE06304,I somewhat agree with Bill Gates. Bill Gates said that richer countries are got richer and these countries won't stop using CO2 and so on. We should make treaty that order these countries follow it. We should also search alternative green energy to replace CO2 and so on.
NBE06080,"The Nobel prize for peace has long history of nominating and granting awards to individuals who does not fit the criteria and Alfred Nobel's idea of peace. The secretive committee has nominated Stalin and even Hitler in the past. Recent winner, Barack Obama won the prize after being nominated for less than two weeks in office has also called a controversy. Barrack Obama is also responsible for the recent bombing in Afghanistan, in other words does not fit the model of peace that Alfred Nobel wishes which is disarmament and against militarism. In my opinion Nobel prize for peace should not be a model for peace efforts and people should not take Nobel prize for peace seriously. The prize itself has always been subject for controversies and the committee is very secretive. And most importantly Alfred Nobel, the man behind Nobel prize himself is the founder of dynamites which is violently used in wars. In my opinion the concept of the Nobel peace prize itself is a joke and probably was made to clean Alfred Nobel's image as an armament manufacturer. The world's richest man, Bill Gates has said that capitalistic private sector is not effective and too selfish to produce effective energy alternative to fossil fuels. He explained the need of substantial carbon tax and that rich countries like USA, China and the EU has to be the role player to solve CO2 emission and make it cheaper for other countries. Recently Green investment is getting more attention and CO2 emission is also inclining. Meanwhile a new survey has showed that publics have doubts about capitalistic system and most of the correspondent agrees that most of them are done in a corrupt manner. In my opinion, capitalism is a great system for a country to gain wealth and spinning economic wheels but capitalism is not the system to enrich the public as it is not the aim of the system. The richer gets richer and the poorer gets poorer is of course unethical and immoral in my opinion. A change is of course needed in global society that is facing a climate change. Alternative energy has to be cheap in order to spread well and be easily used but capitalistic company would not research and use a large amount of its wealth for philanthropic purposes as its main goal is to make profit for its stakeholders. Though capitalism is the system that helped Bill Gates to gain most of his wealth, his philanthropic efforts is not bad at all."
NBE07105,"Bill Gates says that Capitalism cannot save us from climate change. This only an opinion, yet super influential statement for the world. This is because that this quote is from one of the most if not the most influential single person in the world Bill Gates. Actually, before Bill Gates officially states that Capitalism will endanger human beings in terms of the climate change issue, climate change has been the one of the most controversial issues around the world. The appearance of climate change issue has changed the whole world in many different ways. For example, climate change has changed the behavior of developed country which will affect the world's economy. Countries have gotten together for an agreement to reduce the CO2 emissions. This agreement, Kyoto agreement, is lead by developed countries such as Japan, USA, Germany, Great Britain and so on. Those developed countries have set some goals according to the surface are and population. In the end, what happened is that environmentally friendly productions have become the most wanted and boom throughout the world in terms of manufacturing production. Environmentally efficient and friendly products have become the biggest trend for decades which changed the world's economy. Japan actually have taken the advantage of this trend by creating and spreading Japanese technology which are energy efficient. My point is that capitalism is all about making money by business. People have to be remaining in the position of freedom that is an idea of capitalism plus democracy. Bill Gates has pointed out that ideal of capitalism will never improve the situation of world's environment because the environment is not included inside the capitalism ideal when it was created and introduced to the world. I completely agree with Bill Gates but I don't think there is any way to stop the issue of climate change unless the world will face the real hazard of the environmental problem which will endanger majority of human beings."
NBE06405,"I agree with your comment too. In the society of capitalism, poor people can not get the big chance. So, we should think about this problem deeply."
NBE07106,I do agree with your point that thinks about economy in the first hand. Capitalism is created for making money. People wanted freedom so capitalism has emerged so people have take the responsibility of creating it.
NBE06406,"I think so too. In real, poor -person can not get the big chance. Japanese government should do some solving."
NBE06435,"I think that it is a problem to be hard to cancel the difference between a rich person and the poor person. In the economic richness, the economic conditions of the child are similar to the economic conditions of the parent necessarily. If a parent lives a poor life, the child is easy to live a poor life, too. On the contrary, the child will live a rich life if a parent lives a rich life. It cannot be necessarily said that it becomes like this, but the probability becoming like this is high. I think that there are various factors for this fact. At first, one of the factors is education. The child can learn various things for 14 years from the elementary school to the university in Japan if a parent is rich. However, the child can receive education only until compulsory education if a parent is poor. The difference is seven years. The child who does not graduate from a university often gets work of the low-wage manual labor. However, they take work to use the head for because it is considered that a child receiving education well is a smart person. There will be surely the splendid person that I continue studying even if poor and do a company by oneself, and it is to the president. However, the example is extremely rare. Then, another factor includes an occupation. There are the story like the point and the common point, but the quantity of the salary is different in a poor person and a rich person every occupation. When people get a job unless I become an entertainer and an athlete, the interview official of the company often judges a person from scholastic ability. An able person and the incompetent person are distinguished with scholastic ability. The law may not necessarily match, but the custom in the world is so. Therefore the people who are not rich cannot learn it enough. And they get a low-wage occupation by the result that they cannot learn. Therefore they get only a low salary. After all it is necessary to expand education system to correct this difference. We must fix education system so that a difference of the educational background is not born of a rich person and a poor person. There is surely the occupation that everybody wants to do each. For the occupation that I want to do, as for a salary decreasing, there is no help for it. Without a salary, this is because he is substantial at a point realizing a dream. However, for economic conditions, I cannot allow to narrow width of the occupation choice unfairly. I think that it is necessary to widen education system and width of the occupation choice to correct the difference of economic conditions."
NBE06052,"I agree with Bill Gate's opinion. In capitalism, we have to make enormous efforts to stop climate change. Bill gave some example to solve this problem, I paid attention to the opinion related the rich and private sectors. Now it is a fact that they exhaust a lot of carbon dioxide. And most of them are in developed countries. So I also think developed countries should reduce CO2 emission positively. Without this, it is unreasonable to tell developing country to reduce CO2 emission. I also think carbon tax is nice idea. The rich in capitalism has very large power. So to get more money, there may be the person who does not mind climate change. And the poor may be unable to help with stopping climate change. So the system of carbon tax will become the key to stop climate change."
NBE06081,"The world's richest man, Bill Gates has said that capitalistic private sector is not effective and too selfish to produce effective energy alternative to fossil fuels. He explained the need of substantial carbon tax and that rich countries like USA, China and the EU has to be the role player to solve CO2 emission and make it cheaper for other countries. Recently Green investment is getting more attention and CO2 emission is also inclining. Meanwhile a new survey has showed that publics have doubts about capitalistic system and most of the correspondent agrees that most of them are done in a corrupt manner. In my opinion, capitalism is a great system for a country to gain wealth and spinning economic wheels but capitalism is not the system to enrich the public as it is not the aim of the system. The richer gets richer and the poorer gets poorer is of course unethical and immoral in my opinion. A change is of course needed in global society that is facing a climate change. Alternative energy has to be cheap in order to spread well and be easily used but capitalistic company would not research and use a large amount of its wealth for philanthropic purposes as its main goal is to make profit for its stakeholders. Though capitalism is the system that helped Bill Gates to gain most of his wealth, his philanthropic efforts is not bad at all."
NBE07137,I agree with your opinion. I think a developing nation as well as an advanced should also do an effort of reduction in greenhouse gas. Because the amount of the greenhouse gas which occurs in case of financial development is a huge one.
NBE06434,"I agree with your opinion. We should search alternative green energy to replace CO2 and so on, and use alternative green energy."
NBE06079,"I strongly agree with you. Though capitalistic private sectors prioritize stakeholder's benefit, it has made a very large contribution to the society. With economic benefit in mind, private sectors have developed technologies and products which has helped humankind to progress even more. In order to gain economic benefit, companies research and creates products which more superior than competitors and this competition benefits the society and consumers. But there will always be winning and losing in competitions. That's why the richer who holds more fortune has more chances to develops better products, thus stays winning in the competition. In my opinion capitalism may not be perfect but it has a lots of benefits. The energy sector is a very promising sector economically. The idea that capitalism cannot save us from climate change is logically weird. First in order to make benefit a company has to produce better quality, more economic, and easy to use products. With capitalistic way of thinking the idea of cheap, reliable and clean energy can soon be reality as energy companies will always try to make profits with its product."
NBE05640,"Even the manager of the Internet and the technology company, including Mark Zuckerberg of the Facebook CEO is interested in clean energy technology as well as Bill Gates. I searched green energy technology because I was interested in it. It is the energy that does not exhaust the toxic substances such as carbon dioxide or the nitrogen oxide even if it bring about electricity and heat or that is extremely less discharge. For example, the light of the sun, water power, the velocity of the wind, terrestrial heat, natural gas correspond and so on. It is said that it also points to an energy-saving technique at first, followed by electricity generating system techniques such as the renewable energy, the accumulation of electrical technology last. It is necessary for a rich person like him to take the lead in helping economically to let a level stop warming in the technology of these progress. In addition, I think that the government of a developed country is required not only to make the technical development but also to make the system to impose a tax on an energy company and a user, and to change consciousness of the world. The good news is that not only China which is going to plan changing of the energetic constitution, but also Japan and each advanced country pay attention to the most clean technical supporting the clean energy which controls carbon dioxide emissions recently. If green energy attracts more attention as an investment, I think that research and development of its advanced earlier. Bill Gates announced the establishment of Breakthrough Energy Coalition, which invests as new clean energy technology on November 30, 2015. In Japan, there is the subsidy payment, so the spread of the renewable energy, including photovoltaic power advanced, but it has been delayed under the influence of the lower purchase price recently. On the other hand, in the United States, the high-tech company works on the new energy that includes the light of the sun positively. I think that deterioration and worsening global warming is responsible for self-centered developed country and capitalism. I think that they should make an effort for a solution more in a front."
NBE07509,"Before COP21 took place in 2015, most of developed countries had to reduce CO2 emissions and some developing countries tried to reduce them too. However, at COP21, it is decided that all countries have to cut carbon emissions. Also it is determined that developed counties will financially help developing countries. I think it was a great decision that all countries, including China, at least need to make an effort to reduce CO2 emissions. Nobody can ignore the biggest problem, global warming since it is getting worth because of human being. I don't think global warming is going to be better soon but I think at least it will not get worth."
NBE05057,"I agree with you. I also think that China did many bad thing for earth, this was wrong. I noticed that my opinion is always too effected by the social media. In Japan, the media pick up the many news that the image of China worse. Probably, there are many reason for example, the political thing, the economy thing and the historical thing. We don't understand each other yet so the relationship between China and Japan is not so good. So I think that we should know that the social media's way of inform for us perhaps does not have the fair view point. In addition to this problem, I felt in Germany that the action for the environment have already started in many country. Last month, I went to Germany. In that country, there are so many solar power generations and wind power generations. I was really surprised the number. So, in Japan, I want the government to do more about the environment quickly."
NBE05058,"In addition to my opinion, Mr. Shinzo Abe, the prime minister of Japan, also have a power that the change the individual mind in the world. His opinion is enough effective, I think."
NBE05460,"I am in favor of that say Bill Gates. Rich countries will first take the initiative to when it is necessary to solve the environmental problem I think. Other countries doing so also will imitate the country. More specifically, I think it should be much higher the price of coal, which is one of the causes of more global warming."
NBE05110,I think Bill Gates's idea that rich countries consider the solutions to the environmental problems is good. I agree with Bill Gates. I also think rich countries should be the first to consider this problems. I hope that this problems are solved completely.
NBE05321,"Japanese economical problem is serious nowadays. Japanese government's opinion is Japan is gradually raising in terms of economics. But the export industry does not increase though the yen become weak. Japanese depression has continued since about 2014. I think Japan can not recovery this serious economical situation easily. The Abe Government treats the rich over the poor, so that I can not be optimistic about Japanese future. Japan should also consider about environmental problem, global warming. Each countries tries to soften global warming by decreasing CO2 emission. I searched about China's CO2 emission problem. Although many people think China is the largest CO2 emitting country, actually China CO2 emission per person is less than that of America and European country on official data. I wonder it is ""real"" situation. I found that China burns up 17% more coal than official announce. This is intentional error of Chinese government. According to this fact, I understand why there are some problems like air pollution and low CO2 emit rate per person in China. This dishonest acts can not be turned a blind eye to. I think all countries in the world should think deeply about CO2 emission and global warming problem. Japan also have serious CO2 emission problem. CO2 emission have raised 50 ton in 10 years from 1999 to 2009.1250 ton became 1300 ton in 2009. This is large increasing. TOYOTA has plan to cut CO2 emission. TOYOTA's new vehicle can reduce 22% of CO2 emission by 2020, Tokyo Olympic year. And TOYOTA has new Mexico plant in which hydrogen power and wind power are in use for 40% of CO2 emission. I hope these reducing action bring good result for environmental problem."
NBE07173,"I also have the idea that a majority of respondents from seven countries said, so I think the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economics. This economic system is the lack of the equality and the society of competing. I think the equality is important to solve the problem. But socialist economics have demerits. I have no idea and the knowledge about the economy, but all the people including me have to learn the economy and try to solve the problem."
NBE06024,I agree with your opinion. I think that we are reaching the limit of cycle of growth in capitalism too. Now companies are growing by profit supremacy. Companies strive to lower the cost of goods. And Subcontractors strive too for that. So there is no room for alternative energy enters in the market!
NBE05160,"I think it is good thing the richest man in the world, like Bill Gates to use money to invest new green energy. Because we should change our resource. If we continue to use fossil fuel, CO2 continue to be increased and the resource is gone. To avoid that situation, we have to make new energy. To do so, we need a lot of funds. Thanks to Bill Gates act, American people will be able to notice the importance of changing resources. In Japan, we almost depend on nuclear energy. It is sure that nuclear energy emit CO2 less than fossil fuel. But using that power is really dangerous. Some people in Japan protest to use nuclear energy. But now, we have no energy resource which can be substitute for nuclear energy. To develop more new energy, like a green energy is the most important thing. It is sure that to develop new energy we need much more money. But this will be advantageous in the long run. According to this article, a majority of respondents from seven countries said that the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies. I agree with this statement. Because in Japan, children who are born in rich family can go to crime school and enough education to go to the United State or private school. After that they can get the high salary good job because they have good school career. It will continue to their children as well. But the poor cannot have enough money to be educated. After that, they take a low salary job. In my opinion, that is a majority pattern in Japan. I do not well other country's which are in capitalism. But those country may be so. I want to believe that ""The next generation will probably be richer, safer and healthier than the last"". But it will be difficult to be so as now. I can only to believe my country will try to make the country which can give hope to next generation."
NBE07497,"When I saw the headline of this article, I was really interested because Bill Gate is one of the people whom I respect. I read an article about him before, which said ""Bill Gate said ""what the difference between first class and economy class in the plane. whichever arrive to the destination at the same time"" so he normally don't use first class. "" when I read it, I was so impressed and knew Bill Gate is wonderful person. Even when I read this article I felt respect towards him again. Environmental problem is getting more and more serious. it is true that the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies and private sector should reconsider about their attitudes towards to the environments. But I really do not agree the idea like we should give punishment to the country which break the rules of environment. Some countries and people blame China so much but what makes China polluted country? I think definitely it is because of us. If China dismiss their factory, how can people create productives and how can we get goods? so many things are ""made in China"" and thanks to this, we can get productives in cheap price. before blaming China, we should reconsider about how ""we"" can solve this problem. It is not a problem of only big countries. All country should corporate because we live on the same planets."
NBE06622,"Today, some environmental problems has become a very big problem. And global warming has become the most important problem to be solved among them. Meanwhile, Paris agreement was adopted last year and approach to the world of environmental problems began to proceed to a new step by it. Paris agreement is a framework with a legal binding force since the Kyoto Protocol was adopted in 1997. Then, what kind of goals does Japan has set ? The goal is ""reducing CO2 26 percent from 2013 to 2030"". The main method is two. The first one is using renewable energy. Renewable energy is ""the energy acknowledged to be able to permanently used as an energy source"" and solar and wind power are two of the examples. If they use renewable energy, they use no more natural resources and a new environmental problem won't happen. However, there are also weak points. Solar power and wind power generation is likely to be affected by the weather and geothermal power generation is likely also to be affected by condition of earth. In addition, equipment costs are high and there aren't many environments that you can set up a power plant. The second is nuclear power generation. This is a method to evaporate water to use the energy generated by the fission of uranium and generating power by rotating a turbine with steam. It doesn't emit CO2 at all. It is the best advantage. It is also possible to reuse the fuel. It is friendly for the environment. However, this also has a weak points, too. As you know, eye to the public of nuclear power plants became severely since Fukushima nuclear power plant is misconduct at the east Japan great earthquake. Therefore, it is difficult supporters to nuclear power plant ally public opinion and safety issues always haunt the administration. It is great the flow of world is heading for the direction to reduce CO2. In particular, it is more great more celebrities such as Bill Gates has called. There is progressing rapidly technological revolution in the world, but the consideration of environmental problems is essential in that case. It was warm winter in Japan last winter and the average temperature is rising year by year. You should work to reduce CO2 emissions while all countries are collected because the Paris agreement was adopted recently."
NBE05159,"I agree with your opinion which all country should share information about pollution and the rich countries such as US and Europe should think the solution for that more carefully. I also didn't know about the problem of China about pollution, even Japan as well. I feel embarrassed. I feel I should know and understand more seriously about our energy and pollution problem. Japan should imitate good countries which success to decrease greenhouse emission, like German and the United Kingdom."
NBE05217,"After reading this article, I feel that the humans breaks their own living place by themselves. I understand that the system of capitalism is necessary for our nowadays lives, but it is not good for the environment of our living places and the sources which are necessary for our loves. Nothing to say, the amount of oil is decreasing year by year. The oil is necessary for us, but it has the limit. In the future, the oil will be nothing by using by us. The present system of capitalism helps the reducing the natural sources which is important for our lives. The companies don't think they will use substantial sources instead of oil or any other natural sources. I understand what they do. In case, they try to develop their skills and to find new sources, it is hard for them. The research will cost the companies too much. Simply, selling higher and collecting reliable sources is good for nowadays capitalism. I think only big company which has the thinking about the sources can make progress our source and environment problem. I know that Bill Gates afford to pay much money , because he is one of the richest man in the world. I recommend that big companies receive the much money to make substantial sources by rich people and they try to do research. I think it is good way to get new sources which we need for our lives. However it is difficult because I think it is seldom rich people pay money to these production like Bill Gates. I hope that the present style of our living will not change and people will be able to live in comfort."
NBE05218,"Your idea is understandable. As you said, in Japan the gap of rich people and poor people is getting expanding. I read one monograph. It is written in Japanese. Its title is ""the gap expanding in Japan and the USA society"". This paper shows that Japan is the second disparate country in the world. And the situation of the actual Japan and the USA's disparate society. The income between regular employees and part-timers is so different in Japan. The income of part-timers is too cheap to live by oneself. I wonder why the income is so different in Japan? Other countries do not have this kind of date like Japan. I understand the income of regular worker must be higher that part-timers, but the gap is too big. I think it is strange. I hope that the status of part-time worker gets higher and at least little a bit more income should pay to them in Japan."
NBE06802,"Big factor that capitalism brought is mass consumption society. Instead of producing a large quantity of fortunes, the production method that spread out to extend profit called for mass consumption. In other words, it produced many goods using a large quantity of resources and It consumed a thing in large quantities and came to discard a thing in large quantities. Of course it is bad in environment because It exploit the earth in resources when someone produce things. Because people in capitalism use the electricity in large quantities, more CO2 is drained from the thermal power station. When they consume it in large quantities and take out garbage, it adversely affects environment in various form. A lot of chemical substances are included in most of the particularly recent garbage. Because a chemical substance is the thing which there was not on the earth formerly, it is not incorporated in a natural cycle. Therefore it leads to the ground, the sea, atmospheric pollution because it is not returned as energy naturally. It is to achieve an aim ""to minimize work force, and to produce the maximum"" as for the thing which aimed of the socialism. Even if how is the means on achieving this aim, it is good. The environmental disruption does not matter. it needs a large quantity of electricity if it mechanizes all work. Then people in socialism operate a big thermal power station of the quantity of generation intensively most. On the socialism, this is not special. Thought to do anything for a purpose causes the environmental disruption. This is a point leading to the environmental disruption of the socialism. Thus, where cannot say unconditionally in a point of view called the environment because capitalism and neither of the socialism have nothing to do with the environmental disruption whether it is worse. I think that it is that an each person uses a thought about environment to be important."
NBE06621,"I agree with your opinion. Japan will focus on education in job hunting, but this criterion has been delayed in the world. Men of ability is get a good job. It must be the case. Therefore you need assistance to families are facing poverty problems. But now the Japanese government is facing a variety of problems. Of course this problem also important, but it must be run to decide the budget in conjunction with other problems. Therefore, it is the status that can not be resolved immediately."
NBE06803,I agree with you . The developed country should reconsider an environmental problem.
NBE05109,"I agree with you. As you said, all countries should share information about pollution. In addition, I also think that the climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries, as Bill Gates thought. I hope this problem is solved early."
NBE05086,"I agree with your opinion. In Japan, the poor gets poorer. The government should save these people."
NBE05990,"When l read this article, I was surprised that China has surged ahead of the US and Europe in green investment, despite remaining the world's most polluting country in terms of fossil fuels in recent years. Until now, I had an impression that China does not think about the green energy, because they discharge a large amount of CO2. I agree with Bill Gates's opinion that The climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. This issue can't be solved, if all the country don't join forces with each other."
NBE05192,"Donald Trump used a lot of offensive words against Islamic estates, immigrants, London, and so on. When I read this article for the first time, I agree with his opinion because I was afraid of terrorism by Islamic estates, or other immigrants. However, in thinking about his statements, I noticed that he thought about the safety of only his country, but we all should think about all people's safety & happiness. According to Tom Brokaw, who was an anchorman of NBC, it is significant to understand Islamic estates at first. Most of people don't try to understand them, so everyone should do this, I feel. Needless to say, I will also try to do so."
NBE05092,"I think that his offensive speech is a strategy. When his speech listen people that have complain, they feel that he think us and reject other people and deliver us from hardship. Then, these people support Mr Tramp. I think that these are his aim"
NBE05485,"I was surprised when I heard this news on TV. Now, terrorism is very dangerous problem for all over the world. I'm also afraid of terrorism by Islamic estates. In real some Japanese people were killed and many people were killed by terrorism attack by Islamic estates. The ban of muslim immigration may be one of the way to defend terrorism but I agree with Hillary Clinton. She said ""Hate is not an American value"" on twitter. I think Donald Trump's plan is not solution for terrorism of Islamic estates. Some people of Islam may sad for terrorism as many people. We should understand the state of Islam. America is the country that many different immigration lives so that it is more important."
NBE05615,"Certainly, Donald J. Trump should be criticized in terms of humanitarianism. But we have to remember that today there is a worldwide fashion for ultraconservatism or xenophobia. For example, in December the far-right National Front made big gains in the first round of France's regional elections due to the wake of last month's terror attacks in Paris. After all, National Front did not get enough votes to shift the balance of power in the second round of election. Although National Front was defeated in the election, we have to pay attention to people's hate against foreigners. About 80 years ago, ultraconservative leaders came into existence in each country due to the Great Depression. I'm not necessary going to deny all of the leaders' policies, but I think that racism should be blamed. In a sense, People's hate against foreigners promoted the World War II. Therefore Trump's proposal should be blamed. If Trump become the President of USA, not only American but also people worldwide will be unhappy. I want Trump to become a comedian instead of the President."
NBE06994,"When I watched the news on TV for the first time, I was very surprised because I doubted that he went out of his mind. Of course, I am afraid of terrorism by Islamic estates. However I think his statement is disqualification as a presidential candidate because perhaps his statement stimulates Islamic estates and lead another terrorism. Terrorism is serious problem all over the world now, and it is difficult to solve this problem. I think his statement is not solution for terrorism. Therefore we should face this problem actively."
NBE07459,"I also disagree with Trump's plan to ban muslim immigrations. I have three reasons. The first one is that all muslim immigrants are not awful radicals. We tend to have images that Muslims are scary from terrorism, but Muslim is a religion that followers believes in Allah , angels , worships, and fast so on. So every muslim followers do not have Islamic fundamentalism. I heard that parts of them hate fundamentalism. The second one is that there are some people who really want to run away from their own countries to USA. If USA decide to ban all muslim immigration, muslims who are good natured will be persecuted, and they will be treated as well as fundamentalists. In addition to these points , they will not be able to live peacefully because of the dangerous same family . So it is important for us to recognize the difference between fundamentalists and the others. The third one is that decision may give possibilities that the other countries refuse to receive immigrations. USA is known as a country that has liberty ideology, receives many immigrants from all over the world . So USA decision to reject immigrants may lead to the situation that countries begin to hesitate to introduce immigrations. I think USA should be the model of liberty and diversity. In Obama's speech , I heard sentences that in spite of appearances , hometowns, families and religions , our liberty relates one another. We do not dislike muslim because of their own religion , but think what we should do to prevent terrorisms. I give some concrete plans to prevent terrorism. When some big games are held , many policemen should check people carefully. Watching cameras should be set many places and police keeps on watching."
NBE06266,"I disagree with Trump's plan to ban Muslim immigration. At first, his plan is based on racism and inhumane. We should not discriminate people by race, religion and color. In addition, his plan is not rational. Because Muslim is originally far from radical ideas such as acting terrorism. It is strange to think that all Muslims are radical people by seeing few Muslims acting radically. Although his plan is based on racism and inhumane, many people support it. It seems many supports reflect real intention of white Americans. If his plan comes true, another tragedy would happen again like it occurred in Germany during WWII. Surely, we are afraid of terrorism. But, we should not discriminate people by religion. So that, we should find suitable way to prevent terrorism without racism."
NBE06025,"This article is shocked for me. Because almost people dead by this accident. However as a further reason is that I am Japanese and experienced crisis from IS about Mr. Kenji Goto. It was so shocked for us. I felt familiar as I am Japanese. We swore in mind that I should not forgive the presence of IS then. But recently we might forget them. Although the Russian government has denied the association of IS, but it is big problem that we have forgotten the tragedy, and there are happen same tragedy somewhere in the world now. It can say the same thing to other things. For example Great East Japan Earthquake is big tragedy that should not be engraved on the heart. If I asked somebody ""Do you carve the scourge of simultaneous in mind?"" I can't answer with confidence even though it was actually to experience. There are people who are affected and live difficult life in Tohoku. This article reminds me that. And happen in Paris and IS tragedy never happen again. So we do best for them."
NBE07458,"I agree with your idea. To ban muslim immigrations equals to racial discrimination. It is TRUE that islamic fundamentalists happened many terrorisms all over the world. Not to ban muslim immigrations but to ban entering islamic fundamentalists is needed now. I tried to hitting on ideas to distinguish all muslim followers from muslim fundamentalists who especially have dangerous thinkings. However this problem is a case about religion, so that it is hard to do these things , The best idea that I am able to hit on is to publish certificates which are written his activities of politics. If one person has participated some dangerous political activities, police or administrative system could pay attention to him"
NBE06832,"When I watched this news for the first time on TV, I was very surprised. I think that using a lot of offensive words against Islamic estates, immigrants, London, and so on stimulates their angry. Now, terrorism is very dangerous problem for all over the world. I'm also afraid of terrorism by Islamic estates. Therefore his speech against them is not agreed. However, there is a fact that the approval rate of him is very high. I think that people have the same argument like him. And it is important to understand Islamic estates at first. Most of people don't try to understand them, so we should think it."
NBE06920,"I understand a little that Donald Trump focuses on America's attention on the need to secure their borders. Certainly in Paris, residents of the city are seized with fear of terrorism and seem to feel horror and anger to Muslims indiscriminately. But all Muslims don't be the radical people. If Trump passes his proposal to block all Muslims from entering the USA, then many people in the world may criticize him for a racial discrimination and I will also be in the position of criticism. Nowadays, it is certain for the mass media all over the world to watch how each country such as Japan, China, and the USA cope with Muslim. If many Muslims immigrate to Japan in the future, what will we think about it? There will be possibility to happen to a terrorism but it isn't necessarily related to religions. So we should not reject immigrants but prepare the stable and safe system of accepting them. Anyway, Trump's statement about Paris resulted in a bad influence about a relation between the USA and Europe. I hope that from experiencing the tragic terrorism in Paris, many countries will cooperate and solve this problem about terrorism."
NBE05793,"Trump said that the government should ban the Muslim immigration to the US entirely. This statement was based on the effect of incident in California, but one of the reason he said was his ideology that most of Muslim have a complex about the US Surely, Iraq War and 9.11 made Muslim anti-America, a lot of people hate them. I consent his idea that banning all Muslim immigration is rational. However, of course, there are minority. Muslim who work in the US ordinary, who like culture of America. We should think about these people. And also, it said in the video which attached on the News based English page, the US was made by immigrants from UK. It called as ""Land of Liberty"". Today, it become a society like salad bowl where the Hispanic, African, and Asian live. In addition, in the statement by trump, the government should regulate Muslim because they commit a terrorism by the reason of holy war. Indeed, extremists do the destruct and suicide bombing by the reason of it. However, it was wrong that all Muslim have the same ideology. The grounds of his idea tend to regard remarkable action as whole action. Regulate all for the perfect peace. Surely, It is more safety by regulate all Muslim immigration. However, we must think maximize benefit of a lot of people including minority."
NBE05348,"Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump called Monday for barring all Muslims from entering the United States. ""Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on, "" a campaign press release said. Trump, who has previously called for surveillance against mosques and said he was open to establishing a database for all Muslims living in the US , made his latest controversial call in a news release. His message comes in the wake of a deadly mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, by suspected ISIS sympathizers and the day after President Barack Obama asked the country not to ""turn against one another"" out of fear. Trump's comments are likely to roil the Republican presidential race, forcing many of his opponents for the nomination to engage in a debate over whether there should be a religious test to enter America. But his proposal was met with enthusiasm by many of his supporters, who showed their approval via social media as well as at his rally on Monday night."
NBE06235,"If I were an American, I would somewhat agree with Donald J. Trump's ""outrageous"" proposal to block all Muslims from entering the United States. Ruthless terrorism by ISIS irrationally kills a great number of innocent citizens in many cities, and its threat is coming closer to the United States from day to day, and thus the need for taking some severe countermeasures against upcoming atrocity is appealed everywhere in the country. In such a terrible, special, and emergent situation, though there are many non-ISIS Muslims in need of shelter from ISIS, who can assert his proposal is just self-defeating? According to the article, Hillary Clinton wrote on Twitter, ""hate is not an American value"". So, can you describe the proposal as only by the idea of hate. . . ? That can't be! I know many American wants to defend themselves as far as possible, but the general public wants the government to guarantee it takes any measures to protect its people from life-threatening matters, isn't it?As referred above, Mr. Trump is partly applauded by some conservative people, who say he reflected the electorate's real views more honestly than the party's leaders. When I read this, I said to myself, ""As well they may, after all the danger the United States is facing. "" Even if his a bit too strict proposal will be turned down, I think they should abolish the ""visa lottery system"", which Rick Santorum said allows many radicals get into the United States, at least. As most people say, I admit that what he says about this problem is always a little too extreme, and some of his remarks are utterly groundless, but it is also a fact that the situation these days where a spate of terrorism by ISIS menaces lives of the people all over the world makes us be sensitive to Muslim to the highest degree."
NBE06236,"You have good reason to think so, and I also think of his strong attitude toward this problem as one of his strategy to win the upcoming election. But, at the same time, I can support what he says to some degree, regardless of his greatly possible hidden aim. The United States should secure its borders carefully so as to protect its people."
NBE06507,"I was surprised at his plan to block all Muslims from entering the United States. I certainly feel afraid whenever I watch the news of a terrible terrorism. Not only Japan but every country should stand up to terrorism, especially Islamic estates. But, we must keep in mind that all Muslim are not radicals. I suppose such proposal is inconsistent the separation of church and state. And, this plan may lead to causing new acts of terrorism or religious conflicts. Religious problems are very complicated and sensitive. The US government should find another way to prevent terrorism."
NBE05617,"Your idea is about the same as mine. However, your proposal to prevent terrorism, that is to check carefully many people by many policemen and to set watching cameras in many places, differs from mines. This way can invade our privacy more than necessity. If we aim at the liberty, we have to consider the right to privacy. By the way, my proposal to prevent terrorism is to get rid of the terrorist and to protect a minority. This two methods are indivisible."
NBE06568,"I was very surprised when I first knew about Donald Trump and his proposal. His proposal was unrealistic in present America, since I had an image of America as a typical multi-ethnic nation. So I thought he would be criticized by a majority of American people. But the fact seemed different from what I expectation. According to the reports, his approval rating was the top in the Republican Party. I could not believe that! Of course, there are conservative people in the US , but his proposal is too extreme. It is not surprising that those who perform an act of terrorism are only a small part of Muslim. Even if his policy is carried, settlement of the problems would be difficult. What he said is violent language. He is not appropriate for the president. He is only racist. I wonder his remarks unnecessarily stir up anti-Muslim feelings. It is true that protecting the nation from terrorism is important. It is an age when many countries and regions are attached by IS. Especially, IS is hostile to the U. S. American government must take some measures against the terrorism. However, he hurt a lot of Muslim who were far from terrorism. He is calling to block all Muslims from entering the United States. The mayor of London, Boris Johnson said that Mr. Trump's claim about his city was complete and utter nonsense and he added: ""The only reason I wouldn't go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump. "" His response was very nice. I do not want him to be elected to the Presidency. I think that a little more neutral person should serve the president."
NBE06567,I do not agree with you. It is true that terrorism by ISIS kills a great number of innocent people and many countries are feeling threatened by the terrorism. But this is true of Muslim as well. Besides blocking all Muslims from entering the United States is not so efficient because there is likelihood of terrorism by someone living in the US
NBE06268,"I was also surprised to hear this news. His statement is too eccentric idea. It seems that Mr. Trump thinks all Muslim have dangerous ideology. However, it is not true. Some countries are bombing to IS controlled regions. Japanese government also support this bombing. But, we should not forget innocent Muslim people are killed or injured and IS would have doubled their anger against those countries. The more they repeat bombing, the bigger IS strengthen their anger. Also, the more they repeat bombing, the more number of refugees increase. Then, the problem of refugee would get complicated and EU countries would get more worried. Bombing will never lead to solution of IS and refugees. Therefore, we should find another way to prevent terrorism."
NBE06950,"An emigrant policy has the following intentions. The government was in the full-scale examination of the mass acceptance of the emigrant as a stopgap plan of the labor force to decrease sharply with low birthrate and aging. 2 that average number of births per woman can maintain population at because Cabinet Office accepts 200, 000 people every year. I calculate it as a test if it recovers to 07 when wide cloth decrease of the population is avoided for the next 100 years. It is omission, but influence on employment and culture friction, concern to peace and order aggravation resists an emigrant policy. Besides, the foreign worker limits it to talented people with high specialty and technique now, but it is difficult only in altitude talented people if I will accept 200, 000 people every year. Need to found the door comes out to simple labor. Called ""culture friction, peace and order concern to lay friction with the Japanese society the"" employment concern pressed the Japanese employment by an emigrant"" community and religious difference that an emigrant makes"" so that there is what is good, and is concerned about as a big problem when accept an emigrant for the article mentioned above think that is big and is divided into two. It is many social problems and uneasiness caused by such an emigrant, but these are not true shade of the emigrant policy. For example, I am accepted widely by the local society, and the Japanese emigrant who emigrated in Central and South America often succeeds socially now the example that Peruvian President Fujimori and the top of the Brazilian air force are Japanese people. Furthermore, the countries of England and France German North Europe which was a side accepting an emigrant must control that oneself was the greatest emigrant discharge country once now. This is because it is the current United States that each European country particularly Germany, Ireland, England, Italy, Netherlands, emigrant of a country, the area such as Sweden flow in large quantities, and was established. You must note that none of the emigrants is reason to become the social problem in countries of the emigration. Most that formed a rising nation, American work force of the 19th century were relatively supported in such a ""Europe"" by a low German emigrant of the income, an Irishman emigrant. An emigrant generally has a low income level, and the operation environment has many inferior cases again. Meanwhile, it is that the birth rate projects in a meaning called sexual intercourse as the only entertainment or the board to feed a parent in the future, and one becoming higher applies to emigrants of the world not only France. What kind of thing will this mean? Briefly, I mean that I say that the population of the emigrant increases at an increasing tempo when the emigrant first generation repeats two generations, third generation in the country of the emigration though it was minority. In other words the second generation of 200, 000 emigrants, the third generation mean that they let you enlarge the population more every year when they apply it to a former article. It is the United States where Hispanic emigrant including the illegality population of Mexico increases rapidly mainly, but, according to a certain test calculation, the United States is expected now in 2050 by Hispanic increase when it is in the world of the nonwhite. The United States may become the country of the Hispanic 100 years later if I say more. The reason is because the birth rate that is Hispanic than a native American white is predominantly high namely. There are many problems with emigration in this way."
NBE06776,"At first, when I read this article, I was surprised. I disagree with Trump's plan. We must not discriminate people. All muslim is not dangerous. By banning muslim immigration, some of children and women were died. I think we should receive muslim immigration."
NBE07487,"I am opposed to Trump's plan that bans Muslims immigrations. At first, as a candidate, his statement was so thoughtless. It is true that people are afraid of terrorism all over the world, but blocking all Muslims from entering the United States can't be a drastic measure and can't stops terrorism. Secondly, Muslims are not always those who bring about terrorism. So Trump's idea should not be carried out, I think."
NBE07488,"I can't agree with your opinion that Trump's proposal isn't just self-defeating, though there are many non-ISIS Muslims, because such an idea can lead to a racial discrimination. So his statement spoiled the Republican Party's strategy that tries to win the support of Jewish persons, who are cautious of a racial discrimination."
NBE06350,"I can't support Trump's proposal. Surely, to prevent terrorist from terrorism is very important issue and it is necessary for United States to do such policy. When I was a junior high school and high school student, I used to go school that believe in a religion for six years. Then I took a lesson about various religious faith . So I learned Islam including Muslims. People who believe in Islam are not berserk. Ordinary Muslims are not strong bindings and exclusive. Nevertheless, all Muslims are forbidden entrance into a country is powerful regulation. He did his best for their country. His selection is reasonable. But people who believe in Islam have liberty that they can enter a country. I think that maybe there are another measures that can achieve the same propose . Besides this measure is laxer than proposal that Trump insisted. But Tramp's supporter stood by this proposal enthusiastically. On the other hand, the mass media and the Democratic Party react against this proposal. Besides , however Tramp belongs to the Republic Party, part of the Republic Party objected to this. To prevent this proposal, those opponents oppose strongly."
NBE06351,"I disagree with you. If I live in United States, at first I agree with Trump's proposal. But for a second I think better of something, I will change my opinion. United States , the land of freedom, so I will value freedom of everyone. Surely ISIS's terrorisms are very dangerous and people who live in United States are exposed scary emotions. All of the Muslims are not dangerous. So nation should not set an example of moderation to others."
NBE06891,"I agree with you. Donald Trump's plan is not solution for terrorism of Islamic power. Recently, a lot of terrorisms happen. In 2015, two Japanese men were killed by IS. When I heard this news, I was surprised and frightened because I have thought that Japan had not had a relationship to terrorism. This happening made me feel terrorism close to Japan. Actually, IS killed many people. The dead can't revive. IS is foolish. However, IS isn't responsible for all terrorism. In my opinion, each country doesn't make efforts to understand each other. It is true that there are difference of language, culture and religion and that people tend to be opposed by these differences, but that is no reason for each country's not understanding each other. I don't think that people know each other well enough to hate them. In spite of not knowing each other, people may hate them. I think that is most terrible thing. There aren't awful thing than ignorance. Today's society progresses globalization. You can visit America, UK, Brazil, India and Kenya and acquire knowledge of other countries easily. If you hope the world peace, I think you should continue to learn. Under globalization, you should visit many countries and learn in order to understand each other."
NBE07360,"I do not support Trump's plan to ban Muslim immigration. I was shocked with the fact that he cited what President Franklin D Roosevelt had done during World War II. I know many Japanese were suffered by the segregation at that time. History is here for us to never repeat the same mistake. I understand that countries have to secure themselves, but there must be better ways to do that. As former Senator Rick Santorum pointed out in the article, banning all immigration will not help securing us from terrorists. It is because terrorists often prepare a camouflage certification in order to enter the country. Good Muslims do not lie, but they will be rejected by Trump's act. It is just incomprehensible. Also, by reading this article and other comments of Trump or supporters, I felt they do not have evidence at all."
NBE05884,"Donald J. Trump has been criticized for his rampant and discriminatory remarks against women, Brazilian, and Muslims. These discrimination is completely not appropriate for public statesman of US which is called the land of liberty, respecting equality and freedom. But he still obtaining many votes now. I think the reason is his origin. He succeeded in the business of fixed proposal, and made a great amount of money. And he has performed in TV shows. So, he knows how to appeal well to citizens through TV. In fact, his behaves are always focused on by mass media. In addition, he knows about the desires of those who belong to the conservative class, and then trying to grant them by banning immigrations or stopping the decline of social welfare. I think in fact he will not be the president because there is another likely winner, but what we should pay attention to is the fact that the number of people who support him is not so small. The American's value may be changing now."
NBE06865,"I think Mr. Trump's insistence shows that The American peoples fear. The ISIS and other extremist group of Islam are now be well though Europe and North America's military act especially Aerial bombing. A long time history make them compromise difficult and extremist group of Islam hate America's intervention of the Middle East. It proved the event of 9.11 terrorism. Being based on these facts, I think Mr. Trumps insistence is extremely natural action but I don't agree with this opinion. I think it have to divide the Extremist group and other normal Islamic people. Most of Islamic people live normally with strict dogma. They also have human right including right to entrance into America and America is the country of freedom and emigration. It must not refuse people unconditionally for reasoning who is Islamic people. He said America did same regulation at WW2, but after the war president discern that action fault and apologized after time. If America do the same mistake, it will be shame after time. However, from the security sight it is necessary to refuse people who has dangerous mind. Paris terrorism proved there is nowhere to safe though far from battlefield. I think from now the nation security is wanted to tell the different between dangerous people and the other people without invading human right."
NBE05885,I agree with you. There must be certain reason why the terrorists or these offensive statesman are appeared. We tend to forget to understand them and simple criticize or suppress them. This is not the original solution. We should think about their background again.
NBE05220,"I think that his speech and his thinking is understandable for me. Terrorism scares us so much, therefore, I want to avoid that kind of danger by using all means necessary. However, Trump's speech lacks consideration. It can not be that all Muslims have risky thinking and wield violence. He takes things too easy. His speech includes prejudice to Muslims, it is misunderstanding like the following example of Japanese people, many foreigners think that Samurai or Ninja really exist in Japan. There are a lot of news or interviews which show that people who believe Islam say that we are not terrorists like ISIS and ask us not to misunderstand this fact."
NBE06566,"I agree with you! Of course, every country and everyone are afraid of the terrorism. Now we can not predict where the terrorism will occur. But, as you said, a exclusive way of foreign policy would arose other people and lead to causing new terrorism. The US should feel for the fundamental way to solve the problem."
NBE06531,"At first, I want to praise Mr. Trump's act before I express my opinion. According to the article, even as he reflected citizen's view, he was criticized by several politicians. I think it is very difficult thing to say one's own real opinion regardless of impressions of people around one. I believe he is honest person. Then, I agree with him. Certainly, banning muslim immigration is a little outrageous and leads to increase refugees. Also, some people may think he is disqualified to the president. However I think Trump's policy is very simple and the most certain one to prevent crime or terrorism like Paris committed by muslim immigrants. I also think citizens and many politicians may secretly believe his policy is correct in their hearts, but can't say it outside because they don't want to be considered outrageous. I want to ask them ""What is your really thinking?"" Although refusing immigrants is unjust act, citizens should think about the right way to protect themselves from terrorism once again."
NBE06436,"Donald Trump criticized the terrorism of the Islamic nation. I agree to his opinion in this respect, too. Terrorism is a cold-blooded cruel political act to involve the people at large without relations. The posture to say to threaten a country using terrorism is cold-blooded, but I am regrettable at a point to take a holy life away above all. What is what we should make to get rid of terrorism? For a country using terrorism, I think that it is important that we establish the place of the official exchange of opinions. By various circumstances, each country may not contact the country using terrorism, but I think about the method that I can solve immediately only for this. When it can establish the place of the exchange of opinions, it is to hear the say of the country to be the most important. However, you must never compromise so that we get peace. You must find a compromise in the request of the country somewhere, but must be never at the mercy of the country. It is easy to think, but it is difficult to act. Actually, it is still far from realization, but I believe that we are able to realize it sometime because each country makes constant efforts. At that time, it is the greatest if the Islamic nation becomes the healthy religious group."
NBE06532,"I disagree with your opinion. Certainly, what you said is correct, that's to say, muslims are not always those who bring about terrorism. However I think it is ""an armchair theory. "" If I were one of the citizens, I don't want to admit terrorists to come into my country. There are few possibilities that one immigrant is terrorist, but percentage is not 0. Therefore I don't think Mr, Trump's policy is wrong and dangerous. It is an ordinary judgment."
NBE05417,"I disagree with your idea. If I were a member of that country, I don't want them to enter in my country because there is a possibility to happen a terrorism. To be sure, your opinion is good, but the problem of terrorism is very difficult and it is a international problem. We Japanese also should think carefully about it."
NBE06656,"When I read this article for the first time, I cannot hide my surprise. I think this opinion like driving out immigrants. Immigrants immigrate various reasons. Their home country is in civil war or is inhabitable because of natural disasters. In recent years, The Middle East areas are in crisis because of IS raise its head. IS members consists of not only local people but also European Muslim people. Why European Muslim people take part in IS? I think there are religious reasons. In the past days, many European countries make their colonies in Africa, Eastern Europe, and Middle East areas. After World War II , these colonies are independent of suzerain powers. But in many cases, economy and politics can't be stable. So, many people immigrate to suzerain powers looking forward getting job and making their new lives. But after they arrive at European countries, they were exposed to discrimination by local people because of religious and rational reasons. By many years of discrimination, immigrants hold dissatisfaction. In this situation, young people are likely to be attracted by utopia like IS which explains Muslim's specialty. I think recent terrorists' attacks were led by previous European countries' actions, so we should consider immigrant problem more seriously. The problem is more serious than we are thinking."
NBE05418,"I think his statement and action is bravery. Apparently, it is not good to ban all Muslims, but If I were a citizen of accept country, I'm scared because there is a possibility to take place a terrorism, so I think it is good to ban them entering. In addition, terrorism is international problem, so people all over the world ought to think carefully about it."
NBE05827,"I think he just likes to stand out. He wants everyone to pay attention to him. First of all, what he is saying is totally a racist. He says it was a temporary move in response to terrorism. I understand every single person in the world is being afraid of the attack of terrorism, but why would he say such things in the public if he wants to be the president of the United States. That just make his reputation worth. There are some Muslim people living in United States, and I cannot imagine how much they feel offended by that remark. Since Mr trump made such a remark in front of everyone, I understand that everyone criticize about him, even the White House. This article says there are some people who thinks his remark was plausible and natural. Those are people of conservative commentators and they think that comments reflected the electorate's view s more honestly than the party's leaders. However, there are thing you should say and should not in public, even when they really think so. Because he is not a three years old, he is an adult and he even owns a company. He should know it by now. Be a humane. In the article, it says ""former Senator Rick Santorum, seemed to embrace Mr. Trump's impulse but differed on the details. "" and the details are that he've proposed actual concrete things and immigration law that would have - instead of banning all Muslims, but a lot of them. It might be true that United States need to get rid of the visa lottery system, but It doesn't have to be refined for only Muslim, because there are many immigrations from Mexico and other countries. Lastly I don't think he should be the next president of the United states, and I don't even want to think about the possibility of him being a president!! I want someone with no prejudice to be a president of the United States, because United States is the country with a strong power and many countries would follow his policy and the way it thinks."
NBE05723,"Donald Tramp criticized for plan to ban Muslim immigration. I can understand idea that criticized for Tramp to ban immigration. Of course all Muslims don't be the radical people and it may become discrimination for Muslims. In Paris however accept immigration. The result of this, Paris public order is becoming less and less safe and the right wing of a party made a great advance in France. I agree with idea in parts of Tramp, I think that too much accepting immigration can do more harm than good, I can understand his idea. The damage caused by 9.11 matters are enormous. And Recently, ISIS caused a historical unforgettable event. He deserves to have a sense of impending crisis. Indeed, He speaks aggressive language and is overstatements. But, if I think accepting many immigration in Japan, many problem will develop for example, religion, culture, labor, etc. Especially, the point in labor is seriously. In Japan, these problems are developing and In Paris, these problems have developed. I think What Tramp should be criticized is lack of consideration of Muslim. His speech can cause misunderstanding that Muslim is dangerous race. Of course, it is not real. He should consider. This misunderstanding may become discrimination for Muslims. He must correct this point."
NBE05828,"I totally agree with you. Terrorism is now one of the biggest affairs in the whole entire world right now. We are facing it and we cannot ignore it. However complaining or criticizing it doesn't help anything. Someone has to come up with the great idea which could solve the problem. And if Trump are not capable of coming up with the idea, he should avoid saying such a stupid things. He should have came up with the solution not the discrimination."
NBE06864,"I agree with your opinion. It is true that terrorism is serious problem all over the world now, and it is difficult to solve the problem. If America Islamic people to refuse entry into America, it will speed up extremist group of Islamic terrorism. Of course terrorism problem is difficult to solve but refuse people unconditionally is the worst way to solve. We have to understand each other and start conversation to make settlement. If we will be attacked while the process, at the time I don't deny we have to use enforcement way but it have to limit object extremist people, we have not to including normal people. I think Mr. trump is misunderstanding these logic. He can't divide extremist people and not so I think."
NBE05616,"I disagree with your opinion for two reasons. First, your guess that not only the general public but also politicians may secretly support Trump's insistence is way off the mark. Certainly Trump's policy may be good for America in the short run. However, his policy is clearly bad for not only America but also the international society in the long run. The general public and politicians who are against Trump really criticize him. Second, Trump will be bad for the Japanese people. Nevertheless are you for Trump? He affirms the internment of Japanese-Americans in WWII. And he tends to make light of Japan. If he becomes the President of USA, not only the American people but also the Japanese people will be unhappy. Therefore, I cannot help thinking that you are kidding."
NBE07047,"Trump gave an aggressive opinion many times so far. However, I think that this statement should not be permitted. The Islamic nation caused terrorism all over the world, and in these days, the incident in Los Angeles and Paris shook the world. The world main cities are threatened by terrorism. However, the statement of Trump considered the whole muslims to be an Islamic nation and may make muslims angry. In addition, the statement has the risk to expose innocent muslims of the United States to discrimination and prejudice as American discriminatory statement caused the accident in Los Angeles. It cannot solve the problem fundamentally to prohibit immigration. It only leaves ruination in the future between Islam and the United States. Then how can the problem of the Islamic nation be settled fundamentally? ""Hate is not an American value, "" Hillary Clinton wrote on Twitter. However, the moderate method to be reconciled with an Islamic nation is difficult now. I cannot mention concrete solutions. However, It is important that we do not consider the Islamic nation to be Islam and must consider the Islamic nation to be one terrorist organization."
NBE06597,"When I read this article, I thought that Mr. Trump's statement was improper. He thought about the safety of his own country, to be sure, but he was not concerned about international relations. It is necessary to tackle the problem that Muslims escape from the terror of terrorism. Since the problem is so serious, we have to think very carefully. For all its importance, his remark was too shallow. I think that his thought is filled with prejudice. Owing to his remark, it may be difficult for America to develop a good relationship with other countries. He should have humbly uttered his opinions on the problem. Not all Muslims are guilty. Since some Muslims commit a cruel crime, all Muslims tend to be discriminated. We should understand the international situation and solve the problem for the peaceful future."
NBE05527,"I was interested in acceptance of immigration in Japan after reading this article. So, I looked for it. I would like to talk about immigrants in Japan. First of all, I explain the situation about immigrants in Japan. Now, The number of registered foreigners is 2200000 , and it is accounted for many parts by Asian people and Japanese-Brazilians. But the concept of acceptance of immigrants is insufficiency in Japan. There is only the policy of accepting foreign workers. On this immigration policy, the system which accepts foreigner as worker is not perfect. And, I think acceptance of immigrants has three merits. First, hiring of younger human resources. Japan has decreased birth rate and increased aging population, so I can expect that If acceptance of immigrants is possible , they will shoulder Japanese society. Now, on many field, workforce is insufficiently by only Japanese, for example: welfare-service , agriculture and forestry. Already, in care field, many Filipinos have worked. In decreasing birth rate and aging population age, immigrants must be important workforce. Second, a different culture is introduced by immigrants and New service and industry come up. In addition, the consciousness of Japanese will be internationalized by cultural exchange. Third, Japanese value from all over the world changes. Now, Japanese culture and life style are evaluated highly, but future prospects are evaluated negatively. If Japan erases this nation by opening itself, good relationship will build between Japan and other countries. However , there is a demerit of acceptance of immigrants. Some people have negative images of immigrants. They think immigrants bring ""Deterioration of public order"" ""Difficulty of finding work"" ""Culture problem"" and ""Reduction of Japanese people's employment"" etc. . . At this point, I would like to tell these images are fabricate. According to date of crime of foreign residents, immigrants increased, otherwise, the number of crime decreased more 30000 cases. And more, in reality, There are nations overcome this and success. So, I think that demerit of acceptance of immigrants is almost nonexistent. In conclusion, immigrants bring Japan three good influence. They are hiring of younger human resources, growing new service and industry and changing Japanese value to Japan. So, I agree with acceptance of immigrants in Japan."
NBE05724,"I agree with your opinion. Certainly, his policy is very simple and the most certain one to prevent crime or terrorism like Paris committed by Muslim immigrants. Indeed, In Paris, accepting refugees caused becoming less and less safe and the right wing of a party made a great advance in France. French have fatigue. Immigrant is looking for a job in Japan too. But it is difficult for them to looking a job. I heard they are causes becoming less and less safe in France. If that is the case, I can understand Tramp idea that deletes possibility to producing terrorism."
NBE06750,"It is natural for the yes or no to the opinion that Trump expressed as measures to a Muslim to be divided. The opinion of Trump is radical. However, the crisis may be in the face so that such this opinion appears. The degree of risk such as the terrorism in Paris getting higher in the European and American developed country. It is difficult for me to understand that the opinion of Trump and critics. However, I feel that I must think about this problem well."
NBE06654,"I agree with your opinion. International society should cope with terrorism. No matter how cruel treatment they receive, revenges depends on violence must not be permitted. I also think that we must not regard specific religion as radical and offensive. These prejudice makes believer of specific religion more and more aggressive. So, we should consider many backgrounds of present international affairs."
NBE06655,"I strongly agree with your opinion. International society should cope with terrorism. No matter how cruel treatment they receive, revenges depends on violence must not be permitted. I also think that we must not regard specific religion as radical and offensive. These prejudice makes believer of specific religion more and more aggressive. So, we should consider many backgrounds of present international affairs."
NBE07428,"I was shocked at terrorism of Muslim at Paris in last year. Many people were dead by the radicals of Muslim. I cannot understand why they did such a cruel incident and are there any feelings of apology in their minds? Many bereaved families sunk in sorrow from that incident. How do we eradicate terrorism? I cannot understand it and only can hope there will be a peaceful world. By the way, I am angry at Mr. Trump's comments. He said that the United States should block all Muslims from entering their country. Why does he think all Muslims are the same people? There are so many Muslims all over the world, so we can't think all of them have the same opinion of their god and the scripture of Islam. Mr. Trump could not understand this point. After a few days of that terrorism, I watched such a report in evening news. There are many Muslims in Paris. And then, they all said, "" We are not terrorists! We can't have cruel ideology. Please understand ourselves!"" I felt they are so pitiful. So many people in the world may misunderstand that Muslims have dangerous ideas, like Mr. Trump. Also, I agree with Hillary Clinton. She said that hate is not American value. What a wonderful comment! I thought it. She realizes we cannot make the real peaceful world by hate and violence. I impressed her courageous comments. We should recognize Muslims. They are not bad people. It is important that we will admit our misunderstanding."
NBE06267,"I disagree with your opinion. First of all, we should not discriminate people by race or religion although we are afraid of terrorism. Whatever the reason, we must not discriminate people. Additionally, if I were Muslim, I would be afraid of being discriminated by his plan. If discrimination is repeated again and again, it would give rise to hatred and advance the cause of terrorism. All in all, I strongly believe that we should be considerate of people of different religion. So, we should prevent terrorism in other reasonable way."
NBE07140,"I can't agree to an idea of Mr. Trump. I think terrorism by a certain radical Muslim is a very fearful one. Paris was also the very miserable situation recently. So his insistence can also be understood, but a Muslim isn't supposed to think everyone is same radical. An ordinary person is in them, too. For example does the person who would like to go to the United States of America to learn cause terrorism? I don't think so. So I can't agree to his opinion."
NBE06471,"I object to a remark of Mr. cards determinedly. The terrorism of ISIS surely is a thing standing out. The terrorist activity of ISIS including terrorism caused in Paris recently must be prevented. However, Mr. Trump said, ""all Muslims should be forbidden entering USA. "" Of course the Americans of Muslim living abroad are included in this. A case that the Muslim who do not participate in terrorism received an assault happened in each place. I want the person with political power to be careful about remark and not to forget that there's the case that human rights are violated by the statement of only one. And we should not forget that the problem is only ISIS of the Muslim."
NBE07046,"I totally disagree with your idea. If I were an American, I disagree with Donald J. Trump. One reason is that his suggestion seems to ensure at a glance the security of the people, but, actually, is the action that may make Muslims of the world enemies. The Islamic nation is different from Muslims. His proposal regard the whole Muslims as the Islamic nation. The other reason is that to abolish the visa lottery make America conservative. The probability to win visa lottery is very low. Without visa lottery, America would become exclusive. America should be melting pot and free."
NBE06380,"Donald J. Trump gets attention by his extreme statement. It is able to give a stimulus to people, but his speech produces nothing. His speech is so similar to child's struggling. I thought it is no longer a speech. It is just a performance. I often watch him and his extreme statement on TV, and I feel displeased every time I see him and I hear the news about him. His speech and behavior are full of inconsistencies. His statements are not be based on fact or data, so he is not worth to trust. It is simple-minded that he makes statements without thinking. If he will be the President of the US, I experience an anxiety to the international situation, and I will be probably disappointed in the US. I cannot understand why many people in the US support this crazy candidate, and I do not want to understand his real intention of violent language. He says something which is likely to be misunderstood, and many people get hurt by his language. A strong assertion is sometimes needed in the politics, but it is not an appropriate act that a politician which is should protect citizens from harm by rights discriminates them. Is it really a right way that this man becomes the leader of the US? The US is called ""melting pot of different ethnic groups. "" To prove that, the leader should accept all people in the US and people who want to migrate to the US. Nevertheless, this time, he discriminated based on religion. Of course, in spite of that Muslim people have the right to live in the US, why this cruel tyrant decides their destiny. That is the same as Adolf Hitler. However, there might be any reasons that he is being backed up by many of American citizens. I have many incomprehensible points toward him, but I am genuinely interested in the prospect of a presidential election in this year. I will pay attention to the battle of Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton."
NBE06473,"I thought that the approval rating of Mr. Trump fell, too. I was surprised that an approval rating of Mr. Trump did not fall. However, it is thought that there is the proper reason why an approval rating of Mr. Trump does not decline. Probably, as for it, I think, ""an Establishmentarian in the United States says that an approval rating of Mr. Trump declines"". It may be said that a remark of those Establishment strengthen support from Trump's support layer that has an antipathy to them to Mr. Trump. Actually, in the public opinion poll to Republican Party substrate, the yes and no to remark in itself competes, and there are the unfavorable feelings for Muslim in itself in the situation shared widely. These are to be easily understood if the camp carries out a public opinion poll beforehand. In other words, it can be probably said that the case that the White House and domestic and foreign Establishmentarians expressed concern about this anti-Muslim remark is the the result as planned for Mr. Trump who aims at the victory in Republican Party primary election. Soon after having started an electoral campaign in a good manner as for Mr. Trump, there was the low approval rating of Mr. Trump compared to other candidates and nobody thought that Mr. Trump built the superiority like the present. But afterwards, the result that he took a substrate against Establishment in effectively By showing a hostility posture for the Establishment is connected in the present superiority. These are the class of qualified voters dug up by an active action of Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has already obtained around 30% of the Republican Party substrate in strong form and can win by republican nomination competition if he obtain another 20%. I want to learn his successful idea and aggressiveness using adverse circumstances by all means."
NBE05857,"When I read this article for the first time, I was surprised that the person who has such an extreme claim becomes presidential candidate. Although Donald J Trump insists to block all Muslims from entering the United States, I strongly think that his insistence makes the US un-American because the US consists of immigrants from Europe originally. Therefore, his insistence that the US blocks all Muslims is not admitted. Moreover, we should strongly criticize his statement which has no basis about Paris. He always must speak with a sense of responsibility as presidential candidate of the US"
NBE06410,"When I heard of the news, I was shocked and I think how he dare say such a stupid thing. Of course, some terrorists are Muslim and I can't deny that people have negative feeling about Muslim. But religion and the politics is no related and there are many good Muslims who are loyal to their god. In Japan, the problem of racism was serious problem. In Japan, one racism group shouted hate speech against primary school at Kyoto and broke its facility. They maintained that this primary school used Public Park as their ground illegally and hate speech is freedom of speech and we did right thing. In fact, the primary school used Public Park as their playing ground. It seemed illegal, but primary school talked with neighbors over and over again and they got allowance to use Public Park as their playground. After the some trials, this group was sentenced to guilty. I read the books about this problem and I wondered why some people become Racist. To be on the part of racist, the argument that this is freedom of speech. Is partly right. But I don't think so. Because this kind of speech was not saved by constitution. To be chosen as the president of United States of America, he wanted to be focused and he wanted to get some strange people's votes. But I don't think these reasons justify his hate speech and this must be shame. If we do the policy as he says, America is no longer the country of freedom and freedom will pass away. But I thanks his saying. Because i noticed that he must not be the president of the United States of America and we must choose other person, so I thank him. Of course, this is the sarcasm."
NBE06472,"I object to a remark of Mr. Trump determinedly. The terrorism of ISIS surely is a thing standing out. The terrorist activity of ISIS including terrorism caused in Paris recently must be prevented. However, Mr. Trump said, ""all Muslims should be forbidden entering USA. "" Of course the Americans of Muslim living abroad are included in this. A case that the Muslim who do not participate in terrorism received an assault happened in each place. I want the person with political power to be careful about remark and not to forget that there's the case that human rights are violated by the statement of only one. And we should not forget that the problem is only ISIS of the Muslim."
NBE05856,"I agree with this idea. Obviously, he always must speak with a sense of responsibility as presidential candidate of the US In addition, we must not regard Muslims as Terrorists. Therefore, it is not admitted to block all Muslims from entering the United States naturally."
NBE06309,"Trump's plan to ban muslim immigration may not be accepted in public, but his opinion is somewhat right idea. Trump is concerned about Islam's terrorism. Now Islamic States attacks many people include nations, they also attack innocent people. United States is one of main target of IS and if US accept immigrants from muslim , they can cause terrorism. I don't completely agree with Trump's plan, but we should be careful not to be involved in matters such as terrorism."
NBE06308,"I strongly disagree with you. Even if this remark is for political reason, his extreme opinion can't be accepted in society. Only minor percentage of conservative people follow him. this plan comes from his lack of awareness."
NBE06307,"I disagree with you. Even if this remark is for political reason, his extreme opinion can't be accepted in society. Only minor percentage of conservative people follow him. this plan comes from his lack of awareness."
NBE07395,"Immigrants should be accepted. , this opinion seemed to be common sense, buts it really true? Indeed, it is a fact that immigrants do not tend to be accepted and many countries in the world try to eager to give permission for them even if they are in aware of the danger, so the country which hates to accept them can be thought as uncooperative country. However, it is true that there are a lot of differences between immigrants and natives in terms of religion, traditional, culture, language, custom, climate, and so on, so there are many risks -rising of the criminal rate, importing the infection that natives vulnerable to, etc. . . Therefore, Immigration regulations may be good choice if the government consider the native national's safe as the most important thing. I did not know what to conclude about it, but I think the government should take care about this fact very much."
NBE07396,"I think that the United States is a multi ethnic nation, too, but I disagree with you. Immigration problem is not so simple than we think and should not be decisioned with ease. In addition, there is very strong hostility between the United States and a part of Muslim. If the U. S. accept them easily, American who hates Muslim can attack these immigrants and the decision may cause but effect for both of them. Therefore the US perhaps cannot accept immigrants easily."
NBE07022,"I disagree with Trump's banning muslim immigrations. USA's decision may make possibilities that the other countries refuse to receive immigrations. USA is known as a country that has liberty ideology and that receive many immigrants from all over the world . Therefore Their decision to reject immigrants may cause the situation that many countries begin to hesitate to receive immigrants. I think USA should be the model of liberty and diversity. I give some concrete plans to prevent terrorism. When some big games are held , many policemen should check people carefully. Watching cameras should be set many places and police keeps on watching. Not all muslim immigrants are dangerous people. We tend to assume Muslims to be scary thanks to terrorism but all muslim followers do not have dangerous Islamic idea. I heard that almost all of them hate it There are some people who really want to run away from their own countries to USA. If USA decide to ban all muslim immigration, muslims who are good natured will be persecuted and they will be treated awfully. In addition to these points , they will not be able to live peacefully because of the dangerous same family . This is how it is important for us to recognize the difference between fundamentalists and the others."
NBE06054,"Surely, Donald Trump is famous and getting popular in America, you know. But as for me, his opinion is never accepted. First, his remark is too radical. He criticizes another candidate and the conventional president intensely. Certainly, a president to work as is better than a president doing nothing, but I cannot trust what he will do. He said not to accept the entry of the Muslim in America. This will deny all the Muslim. Of course, all Muslim cannot be too radical and violent. I have a friend of the Muslim from Indonesia, and she said most of Muslim expects peace and it is the Allah's wish not a fight. Malala Yousafzai also criticized him. She said Trump's remark will bring terrorists newly. She also said you must not criticize all the Muslim to stop terrorism and high quality education is necessary if you want to end terrorism. I sympathized it very much. To bring up a feeling of morality and ethic is very effective to end terrorism, I think. But now in The Middle East, the right children receive education is not guaranteed yet. Malala appealed for it, you know. So other countries such as developed countries should help them so that the right is guaranteed, I think."
NBE05254,"I disagree with his plan to ban muslim immigration and to be a president. I think his plan is kind of racist. Not all muslim has radical belief like people who conducted terrorism. It is only a part of all muslim. Furthermore, the United States of America has various race in the country, so it should not ban people from entering into country because of religion. I don't want him to be a president of America because of his radical thinking. I think he should change his mind."
NBE05555,"I can't agree with Trump. For sure, he focused America's attention on the need to secure our borders as Cruz said. But I think Trump's proposal was a little out of line. Blocking all Muslims from entering the United States is not good way to protect America from the fears of terrorism. All people who want to immigrate dose not have radicals thought. Not blocking all immigrants but judging whether they are terrorist or not is better way. To do so, immigration law should be reconsidered. The opinion of Senator Rick Santorum is good although it seems to be similar to the opinion of Trump. He said, ""I've proposed actual concrete things and immigration law that would have - not the effect of banning all Muslims, but a lot of them because we need to get rid of the visa lottery system, which is the way in which a lot of radicals have come into this country, "" I'm all for him. The refusal to accept immigrants only make the situation worse."
NBE07237,"I think Donald Trump is very unique candidate. He always supposes things that American may think once everyday in their mind. When one hear what he says first, he may be really surprised and amazed. But Obama, a reasonable elite, is not being able to leading USA to remarkable development now. and his words is become meaningless among some parts of people. For them, Trump's symbol and radical opinions seem more interesting than Obama's excellent speech. Of course, most of the things Trump says is almost impossible to be done. And every American knows that. So, why supporters of this unique candidate exist? The answer is ""Cooped-up feeling"". I think. Everyone want peace, want to be being a rational adult. But problems, global warming, the deal of European refugees, Chinese military expansion, Middle Eastern countries' conflicts and so on, appear everyday and they looks difficult to solve. World seems be becoming worse. People think '""Why am I here? Why things goes bad? Am I to blame for? So, what should I do? But why should I think such things? Things was going well without thinking and such gloomy stress not long ago. . . "". I think people is always thinking especially recently, and they are already weary of thinking. Donald Trump was appeared in front of such people. His radical opinion and vulgar language never sounds like the gospel, but what he says is actually appealing to American nostalgia to some extent. That's why this strange man is being to be in the news all over the world. But seeing this with a point of view as a other country, it merely seems like that many American is attracted by a demagogue. And if he is elected, lots of countries which don't like USA will be really happy, and praise the ""NEW PRESIDENT"" from the bottom of their heart. As a Japanese, I want USA and her citizen make a wise decision. I believe."
NBE05554,"I agree with you. Trump's statement was really thoughtless. His story was just a groundless rumor. Nonetheless, he talked about it in public. He is not aware of responsibility as a candidate for the president. And also, the measure against terrorism should be reconsidered all over the world so that the tragedy in Paris will be repeated never."
NBE05582,"I agree with Donald J. Trump. he criticized to block all Muslims from entering the United States. He said it was a temporary move in response to terrorism. I am of the opinion that Islam is not a religion, such as kill a lot of people and causing the terrorism. This is because to prohibit the entry of Muslims is not a fundamental solution of terrorism. Islam the only absolute of God (Allah in Arabic) and faith, the Qur'an that God is the ruled to people through Muhammad serving as the last prophet is a follow monotheism. It has been preached the spirit of neighborly love in the Qur'an . It cannot be said we have faith really, we must love the people around in the same way as their own, and it is written in the Qur'an . The recognition that Muslim is dangerous because the cause of terrorism is a mistake, and should not block all Muslims from entering the United States because of it. President Obama 15 days, a speech at the ceremony to celebrate the citizenship of immigrants who have been held in Washington, put out as an example that the Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II, to oppose the prejudice against such Muslims. When Muslims cause terrorism, who are the culprits that caused the terrorist attacks in Paris? IS caused the terrorism, the terrorist attacks in Paris. IS are the Islamic extremist organization which works across between the Iraq-Syria. IS strictly thought that we must believe in Allah only in the doctrine. This is violating the established rights of religious freedom. In addition, they have introduced inhuman corporal punishment. IS are once again warning ""now all of Japanese's target"" . we have to complete the correspondence in cooperation with the Allies that was led by the United States for the sake of world peace without hesitation to the declaration of the Islamic countries."
NBE05911,"This news story remained me of the problem about immigration in Japan. Prime minister Abe declared that he will accept two hundreds thousands immigrants every year. I was surprised at this policy when I heard the news for the first time, because I had heard that accepting immigrants brings about many new problem about culture, welfare, job, politics, and our identity. For example, in French, the terrorists entered into a country and gave rise to a disastrous incident in last year. This incident can be based on the policy of immigration. In addition to it, in Germany, many German lost their job because of immigrants. Thus, I had known only some bat points about immigration, so I thought that accepting immigrants was the wrong policy, especially in Japan, citizens were more exclusive than other country, so this policy would be failure. I search more about this policy when I read this policy again, my thinking is changed for two reason. First, Japan comes face-to-face with harsh reality: the aging of Japan's population society. This brings about shortage of the young work force population. If we do not do anything about this problem, we cannot pay tax for welfare, and Japanese welfare system will be break down. Accepting young immigrants is an effective method to solve this problem. In present Japan, there is a great demand for the elder care business, but this business world will be troubled by labor shortage, so the job for immigrants will be increase. Second, not only person who has a nationality but also immigrants have the fundamental human rights. They have the right of a minimum standard of living. Japan should accept immigrants positively, because Japan is one of the richest and abundant countries in the world. I think that we have to be a reader to solve this problem."
NBE05910,"I agree with you. I think his way of thinking is distorted. But government must prevent all the possibility of danger of terrorism, so I can understand his thinking about the policy. Even though he makes many moral policies, citizens criticize him when terrorism was occurred."
NBE06381,"I think so too. Actually his speech gets attention easily, and some terrorists might hears his statements anywhere in the world. In present, mass media or SNS is expanding in the world, so statements of all people on the Internet is strengthening their influence on various international issues or arguments. Therefore, people have to be careful to transmit their opinion on the Internet with a light heart, because we do not know who, when and where someone will be going to attack us in this times. People in the US also might be attacked by the influence of the man who says extreme statements to the dangerous terrorism organization many times. If the US will be attacked, impact that gives to all over the world is immeasurable. I think that Donald J. Trump has to think of protecting citizens in the US if he wants to be the President of the US with a strong leadership."
NBE07074,"It's fact that terrorism is very scary. It is natural that Trump wants to refuse the entry to the united states of Islam. But as Hillary Clinton wrote on Twitter, Hate is not an American value. The United States consist of a lot of immigrants. Certainly, refusing Islam is one of the measures to prevent terrorism. However, it may produce the hate of Islam people at the same time. Trump's way of thinking is including racism. Learning from the history, ""Racism"" often cause war! The abolition of the racism is important to make peaceful world without the war."
NBE05764,"I think, Donald J. Trump should not have said that. That's because, he is a presidential candidate in America. America has the spirit of free and equal, so the next reader of them should not do discrimination. There is a statistics that a quarter of the Muslim in the US can justify violence to the country as a crusade. It is said that he have referred to the data. However, it suggests that three fourths of Muslim do not justify it. In addition, many people doubt the truth of the statistics. In such situation, his opinion cannot have good grounds. I think, the Islam is not evil, but his remark can make people have prejudice against Muslim. And in this sentence, there is a description that ""He said it was a temporary move in response to terrorism, citing President Franklin D. Roosevelt's authorization of the detention of Japanese, German and Italian immigrants during World War II as a precedent"". In other words, he considers all Muslim as enemy. However, it would not make the problem be settled and a chain of the hatred spreads. I think, we do not refuse them but try to look the way understanding each other."
NBE07174,"When I read this news for the first time, I was very surprised because Donald J. Trump used a lot of offensive words against Islamic estates, immigrants, London, and so on. Recently, terrorism has happened in Paris. This news makes us scared. By the sports, the free skate of the ISU Grand Prix Series in Paris which is the meeting of the figure skating was called off. From this the damage by terrorism is heavy. I'm also afraid of terrorism by Islamic estates. So we should refrain from the remarks like him."
NBE05933,"Donald J. Trump on Tuesday stood by his call to block all Muslims from entering the United States. He said it was a temporary move in response States. He said it was a temporary move in response d"" It is true that after be attacked in Paris, there are fears of terrorism in world. Therefore, to remove that's fear it is natural that take a method like Donald Trump's policy. But I think that there are no future without terrorism. So I don't agree with Donald Trump's idea."
NBE05671,"I am agree when I read this news. I think that the discrimination by a race and the religion must not do it. There is surely the person attacking us in people of the Islam. For example, terrorism was caused last year in Paris. It is very scary that terrorism is had. However, I think that there must not be such a thing. This is not high-sounding statement. There was the discrimination of the Korean during war in Japan. Japan regrets it. We must not repeat the history."
NBE06565,I agree with you very much. Racial discrimination must be abolished. There are many religions in the world. We should be free to practice our own religion. Trump will think that there is the danger that all Muslims do an act of terrorism. This thought is nonsense. I also think that we should not discriminate people by race and religion.
NBE05700,"Your opinion that his offensive speech is his strategy is very interesting to me. Indeed, Trump's attitude is confident and conservative, and his opinion is outrageous. Thus he can expect easily that he was criticized. I think his aim is to attract people's attention that the fear of terrorism is no longer foreign affairs, so the United States should secure its borders carefully. Especially the United States experienced terrible terrorist attack in 2001, so I can understand there are some people who hate and scared of terrorism."
NBE05761,"I agree with you at some points. For example, you said what he said is violent language. I think so too. There are many muslim who live peacefully in the US. His remark injure such people. Donald J. Trump was a presidential candidate. I think, such person can change this situation by other ways. For instance, he can fix the social security system more for the young. In fact, there are the young who support IS because of distrust in their government. I think, such way is more realistic than refuse all muslim."
NBE06165,"I don't be able to determine clearly whether Mr. Trump's proposal is good or bad. Since 9.11 large scale acts of terrorism have occurred all over the world. They are very dangerous and it is difficult to prevent terrorism from occurring. So, it may be best way for preventing occurring terrorism to ban Muslims immigration. However, nobody knows whether prevent it or not by doing so. In addition to this, Muslims totally unrelated to terrorism will not be able to go on a trip to America. I want to know and think more deeply about this issue."
NBE07073,"I think his statement and action is wrong. So I am disagree with you. It is true that people who live in the country accepting Islamic immigrant are afraid of terrorism. But I think hatred is raised by experiencing racism discrimination, to be left out and so on. The hatred that lost a place to go leads to terrorism or war. It is one of the method to prevent terrorism not to let people of Islam enter the country. But now, it is impossible to completely prevent the entry. This problem is complicated. I want the United states to solve this religious issue as the world leader."
NBE07294,"When I read this article for the fist time, I feel angry and suspicious. First, it is so ridiculous to criticize one religion. Indeed, it is not strange that some one in the world criticizes one religion. But Donald Trump is the man that will possibly be a president of the United States. He has a great influence on many sections. Recently, Donald Trump started to shed CM about a manifest. This plan is, as the article said, to ban the Islamic from entering United States. Indeed the situation about the middle east is very serious because the Islamic state killed many people and occupy many city. I watched the news yesterday, in the future, the Islamic state want to occupy Mecca. But I think to discriminate someone who is Islamic is too bad. Because all Islamic are not very dangerous. People all over the world have to be dealt with equally regardless of their religion. In Japan, there are many people who have no religion. So some Japanese can not understand this situation. But people all over the world can understand that to discriminate against some who is islamic is bad. I think the politician, Donald Trump, is very inhumane. But in the United States, a few people support him. Indeed, islamic state is fearful and dreadful. To ban the Islamic from entering United States is one way. But I think this is final way. There are many other ways. First, the government enforces immigration check very much. Second, the government stops selling the gun. In the future, Japan will face this situation, but I want Japanese government not to conduct such a way."
NBE05763,"I can understand your felling, but I do not know if I agree with you. I think, the immigrants from islamic countries are victims of IS's attack. So, they are not terrorists. Of course, there could be terrorists hiding among the immigrants like the case of Paris. However, we have to tell common muslims from terrorists clearly. I think that many Japanese do not want to accept immigrants positively. Maybe the fact that Japan is an island nation and we have strong identity affect it. We should have understanding of the immigrants more."
NBE07206,"As The United States is now the most powerful nation throughout the world, they have to lead the world to better direction. It is not impressive that the top of the strong country says that they will block any immigrants from middle-east. I understand that the government has role to protect their people and land, but from the point of view of humanity, they should save immigrants and refugees too. Once they refuse to do it, they won't given any help when they face difficulties, which exactly means that the world will abandon him. Difference of what you believe undoubtedly exists because no one is the same person as someone else. Religion has been used as political tool since it was born long time ago, then we should start to consider how to handle it and how not to be handled by it."
NBE07429,"Your comment is absolutely right. We never recognize what Mr. Trump said. Of course, that comments of him connects with racism like Hitler. He is the source of generating hate and pain. We never discriminate people by sexes, races and religions. The United States accepts immigration. This helps many refugees all over the world. I want them to continue it."
NBE07236,"I disagree with you. Because his vulgar language is very disgusting and makes me really irritated. If other people hear his radical speech, they may become angry and destroy their TV. And what he says is out of logic. Before notice his ""strategy"", most of people leave from his sight."
NBE07293,I agree with your opinion partly. Indeed I and everyone are afraid of terrorism. To fight the terrorism have to be taken. But to ban the islamic from entering the US is not good. And I agree with your opinion which he wanted to save only US.
NBE06805,"I regret that he declared that he expel Islam emigrant. In late years the reaction to Muslim is changing by an action of terrorism and ISIL, but I think that it is wrong to expel all the members because it is a part."
NBE06201,"I think that Trump's statement put out American real. The United States is a country of immigrants from the first. A lot of races, for example the Anglo-Saxon race, Latin race, Hispanics and Slaves and so on, get gather in the U. S. and the United States completed. So, the US is often called ""salad bowl"". Now the United States accepts constant number of immigrant every year. This is impossible for Japan having problem that is accepting immigrant or not accepting immigrant. On the other hand, the United States and a lot of Americans experience 9 11 terrorism. This terrorism is to hijack airplane and to attack the building, named World Trade Center (WTC), in central of New York by hijacked airplane. Many people were killed in the terrorism and living people don't forget the terrorism. Al-Qaeda, Islam terrorist group, practiced this terrorism. So, Americans don't like Islam people, but a lot of Islam people want to come to the United States as immigrant now. The United States and Americans are troubled ""salad bowl"" or ""fear of terrorism"". Tramp chooses ""fear of terrorism"" So, he can say banning Muslim immigration. Before saying, there are ""salad bowl"" and ""fear of terrorism"". Whether people agree with Trump's idea is that the most important thing for the United States is ""salad bowl"" or ""fear of terrorism""."
NBE07235,"I agree with you. Donald Trump's idea is too radical. USA government should think the immigrants as lives. And I also think, to be radical is actually good for solving one problem, but if solve one problem in such way, more difficult problems will be appear. Though radical opinion looks simple and easy to do, this is the most difficult way to solve problem. I think."
NBE05966,When I read this article I was surprised. These days terrorism is very important issue all over the world. We Japanese also are afraid of terrorism. We should not think it is somebody's else problem. In fact many people were killed by terrorism attack by Islamic estate and there are Japanese victims. The ban of Muslim immigration seems to be one of the way to prevent terrorists from coming into the united states. It is against the united stats' policy. The country is made up of immigrants. So they should not turn down immigration. And the plan which Donald Trump thinks cannot be the solution for terrorism of Islamic estate. I cannot understand the reason why he is applauded by many people. Can't they imagine what will happen if the policy will really be enacted. This plan will provoke terrorists. This plan makes further hate of terrorists toward the country. I think that this plan will end up causing another terrorism attack. This problem is too difficult but to make the peace and better world we should go on thinking about the problem and make a great effort to solve the problem.
NBE05965,I agree with your opinion. I am also afraid of terrorism attack by Islamic estates. I think the plan to ban of Muslim immigration cannot be the good solution for the problem too. As Hillary Clinton said on twitter hate is not an American value. I believe that someday we can solve this big problem.
NBE06130,"I was very shocked when I read this article at first time. Trump's remark is racial discrimination. However Trump is supported by a lot of people. This fact signify that people feel terrified by terrorism in France. If I encountered a scene of terror, probably I feel terrorism. However I think it is wrong for that trump's opinion. Trump's opinion is that deny entry of Muslim believers. All of Muslim is not terrorist. Moreover I think that Trump should not say this opinion, because Trump is a statesman. The statesman is leader of the country. Leader should not do discrimination. Muslim is afraid by people because terrorism has occurred in France. However I think that Trump makes use of an inordinate from terrorism. It is very sad for me. I want to become a world that is not of discrimination in religion."
NBE05762,"I agree with you. I also doubt that the muslim immigrants are equal to terrorists. They do not have the hostility and are also victims. So, we should tell them to terrorists clearly. And I was interested in a point you said that If his plan comes true, other tragedy would happen like in Germany during WWII. I also think, they cannot get rid of terrorism if they reject all muslim immigrants. Of course, we have to fight against terrorism. However, we should do against racism too. Otherwise, we cannot live really peaceful society."
NBE05726,"I really agree with your opinion! There is surely an advantage to accept immigration. For example, aspect of workforce, especially like a progressing aging society. But there are difficult points about accept immigration, which can't overlook. This is for example immigrants and natives in terms of religion, traditional, culture, language, custom, climate, and so on. And most difficult disadvantage is increasing criminal rate. Indeed, In Europe countries which accepting refugees from Middle East are in trouble increasing criminal rate. I think accepting immigration should be cautious."
NBE06129,"I disagree with you. I was surprised when I read this news, too. And I think that Trump should not say him opinion. However I do not think that we should avoid remarks such as Trump because there is scary terrorism."
NBE07023,Your comment is so great. I think terrorism is the problem to not only countries it happened but also countries which terrorist comes from
NBE05699,"Recently, Islamic States has threatened the world. Muslims who have a firm religious faith in Muhammad attack at several cities and abducted people regardless of their nationality. The terrorist attacks by IS at Paris and London shocked people all over the world. Indeed, Donald J. Trump's opinion was too aggressive, but considering these foreign affairs, there may be supporters with him especially conservative people, some of whom proposed that we should get rid of their visa lottery system. However, I have a question if banning Muslim immigration may be racial discrimination. Not all Muslims are radical, so it is pity that reverent Muslims are misunderstood and criticized. I think he should not have said this plan that connected to racial discrimination as an official person. Besides, if the United States, one of the biggest countries, take this measure, other countries will be confused. As the White House said, he had disqualified himself from serving as president."
NBE06833,"Your opinion that his offensive speech is a strategy is a new idea and interesting to me. Thinking this news with the idea like you, I can change my mind that I disagree with his speech simply. I also think of his strong attitude toward this problem as one of his strategy to win the upcoming election, and actually there is a fact that the approval rate of him is very high. Before I read your comment, I think that people have the same argument like him. However, like your opinion, I think his offensive speech is a strategy, and doing so on purpose, he has the aim that he attract people's interest."
NBE05725,"I disagree with your opinion. Right from the beginning His idea leading another tragedy would happen again like it occurred in Germany during WW2 is gap in your reasoning. And you ignore risk to accept immigrant. Of course I don't say that should recommend racial discrimination. But indeed accepting immigration increase criminal rate. And if they accept immigrant from Muslim country for example Syria and Turkey now, it is too dangerous. Now, idea that should accept immigrant can be hear hypocrisy. So, I don't think his idea is inhumane. Because he is candidate of president. I can understand Tramp's idea."
NBE06687,"Donald Tramp insisted on plan to ban muslim immigration. This is problem of immigration. Actually, this problem occur in the world. Germany, France and Japan and so on. For example, Germany tolerated entering a lot of immigrants for many years. Because it need people who works hard in it. However, it showed reluctance to accept immigrants recently. Because it must spend money for a lot of immigrants and became unsafe. In general, immigrants are labor power, but They can give little money. They are poor. So their children can't take the education of high quality, and they give some money from national tax. by social security system. Some people say complain about this state. If Germany is in a economic depression, the poor 'German' criticize them and they are isolated from 'German' . They get dragged into recession. This is one of the problem about immigrants. France have a lot of immigrants, too. Because France is near Africa. In addition, a lot of african can speak french. So it is easy for the poor african to enable to go to France. There are lot of immigrants in France, and there are lot of problems about immigrants in France. For instance, if there are lot of immigrants, you think they disturb the peace and order in general. It is not an exception in France. The south of France, near Africa is not safe. And the area that a lot of immigrants live in is not safe. Because they are poor, they commit a crime. So they do not be liked by 'French'. France is the same state of affairs to Germany. What is the situation in Japan now? Fortunately, there is few immigrants in Japan. We seldom have neighbors who are immigrants. There are only a lot of 'Japanese'. However, Japan will receive some immigrants. If Japan receive some immigrants, Japan get the labor force, but Japan may not be safe. Economic problem may occur. Receiving immigrants must pay attention. The USA is the same. There are a lot of immigrants in the USA. In addition, Islamic State (IS) is developing now. IS has terrorism, so IS kill a lot of people of several races in the world. It is only natural that islamic people are not be liked in the world include the USA. So I can understand what Mr. Tramp said. Indeed, Mr. Tramp always say everything radically and extremely. And he is called in populist. For example, he criticized another candidate in a sharp tone. In addition, he used words that we can't use in public. He is criticized in these points as a matter of course. However, I can agree to his immigrant policy too."
NBE05672,"I have an argument in a part of your opinion. You wrote a focus only in the United States. However, I think that this is to be able to say about the world. Trump refuses an invasion of Islam. However, I think that I may refuse the United States. Because, If the United States is attacked, this is because it thinks that it is fought. The World War will begin if a person from Islam attacks the United States."
NBE07269,"At first, I was very surprised when I heard this news. I disagree with Trump, because it is discrimination if all Muslim are forbidden to entry into USA. And I think only IS should be forbidden to entry into USA."
NBE07270,I agree with your opinion. Because it is discrimination if all Muslim are forbidden to entry into USA.
NBE06409,"I think so too. Because, many people are afraid of terrorism. As what happen in France, We understand what a terrible terrorism is. So, people in the country do not want to enter islamic."
NBE07107,"First of all, I can understand Trump's idea but I don't think that it is an idea that important figure should say. Trump is a candidate of the president of United States of America in the next period after Barrack Obama. Besides his reputation, he is still an important figure who will give a huge influence on the wide range of not just people in the United States but all around the world. Therefore, I can understand what he is saying but I cannot agree with his idea and at the same time I think that Trump should not say this controversial quote in front of media. Religious conflict is always the most delicate and controversial topic around the world. Religious did provide relief to a tremendous amount of people but on the other hand, it also kill a lot of people as fact. I am just talking about fact and I have no opinion about the existence of religion yet some religion does include extreme idea or teaching that will lead to violence. Muslim has become the hottest topic around the world because of ISIS. Not all Muslim are ISIS and people knows that but it is hard to understand than just knowing. It is hard to not to react when you see a Muslim people walking around in a country, which is not Muslim. To draw a conclusion, I can understand what Trump is feeling and trying to say but he should not say that in front of people. He had to think about how influential he is on the media."
NBE07108,"I think you making good point but I disagree with your idea of ""safety of only his country"" part. Trump is a future candidate of President of US. He have to put people in US on the first priority. He have to win some polls by doing so. What he is saying is offensive but choices will be done by people which is democracy."
NBE06408,"I agree your comment strongly. Because if we are the same situation, we must stop coming the islamic."
NBE07139,"I agree with you. I think terrorism by a certain radical Muslim is a very fearful one. Paris was also the very miserable situation recently. So his insistence can also be understood, but a Muslim isn't supposed to think everyone is same radical. An ordinary person is in them, too. For example does the person who would like to go to the United States of America to learn cause terrorism? I don't think so. So I can't agree to his opinion."
NBE06863,"I agree with you corporation all over the world is very important to stand up to terrorism. Also Japan have to do something as one responsible country of international society. However, we have to look up the way to exterminate ISIS without violating human right"
NBE06688,It's difficult to solve this problem. Indeed a lot of i
NBE06689,"It's difficult to solve this problem. Indeed if there is a lot of immigrants, many problem occur. However, the country get much labor force."
NBE06715,"It was right that Trump is criticized. That is just a human discrimination and this is totally wrong not only as a politician but also as a human beings. Maybe there is no need to write human history, but I want to say human discrimination generates anything good. Many founders of big companies born in America are immigrants. Best example of Steve Jobs, founder of Apple. His father is immigrant from Syria. According to the news, more than 50% of founders of startups in Silicon Valley for this 20 years are immigrants. Immigrants are playing really important roll in American economy. And we have to think about Japan. Many people think Japanese people are tolerance for foreigners but I cannot totally agree with that. We have very cold aspect for stranger. Good example of that is ""hate speech"". Hate speech is kind of vent for economic differentiation. Economic differentiation is big problem, but human discrimination never justify. I think strongly that stop Trump to say like these human discriminations. He has giant power for making mass opinion."
NBE07323,"I agree with you. I think his proposal should be criticized. It is filled with prejudice, and lead to more serious opposition. It is probable that IS are stimulated and it threatens the United States' national security. I can't believe that the proposal was made by a presidential candidate. His approval rating must have fallen. Because Muslims will not vote to him, and to begin with, the United States itself was founded by immigrants. Closing its border to Muslims will spoil its untiring efforts to oppose radicals. I think he no doubt disqualified himself from serving as a president."
NBE07141,"I disagree with your opinion. I think terrorism by a certain radical Muslim is a very fearful one. Paris was also the very miserable situation recently. So his insistence can also be understood, but a Muslim isn't supposed to think everyone is same radical."
NBE05462,"I am afraid of terrorism, too. I had thought Japan is a safe country, and we were not related to the terrorism by Islam. However, the incident that some Japanese were captured and killed by terrorists make our government and us conscious that we are connected. Thinking about own country and own life, I agree with Trump, but not all Muslims are evil. some of them should be allowed to immigrate."
NBE07511,"I don't think Trump's comments are totally wrong. Lots of people are afraid of terrorism and want to protect themselves and so do I. So I think he just wanted to claim the opinions that many people have but his way to protect his own country and the words that he used were unsuitable and racism. It is like a kid ignores his friend who he hates. I think he didn't try to think about Muslims and how to deal with terrorism but he just refused them, even not all of Muslims would be terrorists. I think it is one of the biggest problems in many countries. I'm afraid of terrorism like in Paris that could happen in Tokyo Olympic in 2020. I heard that IS attacked Paris because lots of people came from all over the world for COP21, so Tokyo could be the target. I think Japanese government has to think how to protect our country not like Trump's way. I don't know if Japanese people think that we are racists but I think we are because we refuse more immigrants than other countries. I don't think it is the best way to just refuse people from other countries but we need to think how to live together peacefully. If we could do this, I think we would have the solution of protecting our county from terrorism."
NBE07498,"After terrible terror happened in France, many muslims post their picture which they wrote ""I am a muslim but I am not terrorist"" on facebook. I totally understand for the people who lost their family or friends by terror, all muslim must be seen as killers, but in this terror, victims are not only people killed by terror. muslims are also victims because they lost their home or social states because of some terrorist which is only a part of muslim. racism only brought racism and terror only brings anger and revenge. I would not say I agree Mr tramp one hundred percent but I partly understand what he wanted to tell us."
NBE05062,I think that his opinion is natural as a representation of the United States. But I worry about the goal of the refugees. Where should they go? The extreme policy can be a new trigger of the bigger terrorism. So I really concern it.
NBE05061,"I really agree with you, especially, this part, racism only brought racism and terror only brings anger and revenge. Now, people in the world maybe think that the culture or the religion of muslim are so dangerous. But as you say, it is not true. Their culture or religion itself is good. The terrorists are only small part of them. Many normal muslims want us to understand this point of view, probably. And, we should not decide our opinion by one fact. We always should see the thing from some perspectives."
NBE05059,"I disagree with your opinion. But as you say, there are so many refugees in this world and we cannot judge which person will be dangerous for us or not. So, many country ban accepting them. But the refugees can be a new labor force? In this situation, it is difficult, I think. Maybe the European countries will not accept them as labors."
NBE05060,"I have a little different opinion with you. But as you say, there are so many refugees in this world and we cannot judge which person will be dangerous or not. So, many country ban accepting them. But the refugees can be a new labor force? In this situation, it is difficult, I think. Maybe the countries especially christianity will not accept as a labor"
NBE05090,"I agree with your opinion. I think that US is one of the biggest country in world, so the country's candidate should all country's happiness and safety."
NBE05162,"I don't know why the criticism of Donald Trump was far from unanimous. He is not a politician. But he is a famous businessman. So he is good at attracting people's attention by using aggressive and discriminative words. I feel it is nonsense. At first, his controversial statements attracted media's attention, because it was interesting temporary. But he repeated so much such a statement. I am afraid of hearing his statement. I think there are a lot of people feel so sad about his discriminative and outrageous proposal. He criticized about police of Paris without citing any evidence. It was very rude. His main concrete proposal is to block all Muslims from entering the United States. To be afraid of terrorism is natural. But the Muslims who have no connection with terrorism will be very poor. To block those people is very big discriminative and evil act. I wonder why he cannot think about those people. And I think such an aggressive words will stimulate ISIS. I think only to block Muslims cannot prevent terrorism. The problem is not so simple. If he will be the president of the United States, a lot of people in the world have a doubt about the United States. I do not want the United States to be such a future."
NBE05087,I agree with you. Mr Trump confuse ordinary people with terrorists. It is so dangerous because he doesn't divide religion on terrorism. I scared him.
NBE07510,I don't think that his offensive speech was his strategy. I think his opinion is selfish and he just takes care about his country.
NBE05385,"I have the both opinions of agreement and disagreement with Donald J. Trump. My reason for agreement is that I think many muslim immigrants will enter the United States and its government cannot deal with them in the aspect of welfare, such as house and insurance. On the other hand, my reason for disagreement is that it is possible for muslim immigrants to cause terrorism in the United States. I think that the government should be more careful when it decides something important."
NBE05255,"I disagree with you. I don't think that his speech is strategy. In my opinion, he dislikes muslim because of terrorism and cruel action, so he only represents his thought."
NBE05278,I think he is very bad man. I think he should not be a politician. This news is very horrible. The US government should this US's future.
NBE05461,I agree with your opinion. I think America and any countries should understand that not all Muslims are violent. More careful policy is need.
NBE05161,"I agree with your opinion. It is natural that people are afraid of terrorism by Islamic estates. But we should think about all people's safety. I did not know about Tom Brokaw. After reading your opinion, I thought I should try to understand more them. I can do to try to understand is very small things. For example, to watch news and to read books. But it is different I do not all about things about them or not. If I watch news on TV, I feel the happening is no connection with my world. But the thought is wrong. We have to think about all incident connect with our world. Always we should deal like our thing."
NBE05463,"I disagree with your opinion. Surely, not all the muslim has violent idea, and some of the muslim needs a safe country. However, the possibility of the danger by immigration has become higher since the terror in Paris happened. I can understand Trump's idea."
NBE05324,"If I am American citizen, I do not support Donald Trump. I think his idea for Muslims is too selfish. All people may be have fear for terrorism and they want not to be victims of IS. But refugees come from Syria at the risk of their lives. We all have to rescue and save their lives by accepting to our countries. I know there are a lot of problem of receiving many refugees and I think we can not find good ways for this problem without limiting the number of accepting. But Trump's idea is only for Muslims. This is inhuman idea. Not all Muslims are criminal people and this is a kind of racism. I think severe entry formalities can keep the terrorism away."
NBE05323,I think so too. Not all Muslims are terrorists and they are also victims of the Paris terror. Only few Muslim people are extremely cruel but most of Muslims are normal people. They have their families and their lives. I watched the refugee situation in TV today. That was very severe. Refusing their entering because they are Muslims is immoral.
NBE05322,I agree with you. There are few countries which can accept refugees. Germany is one of the most positive country about entering refugees but I think the capacity is limited. I anticipate Germany will become full and have to shut border in near future. We need more countries to accept. Japan should receive more immigrants.
NBE05484,"I think this problem is very serious and now, the people of Islamic in the world receive eyes of prejudice. I became very sad when I watched the news about this. I researched this news more. The Muslim community in the UK has been 'disgusted' by the idea of a possible ban on Muslim girls and young women from wearing veils in public places. Home Office Minister Jeremy Browne says the government should consider the ban. ""We should be very cautious about imposing religious conformity on a society which has always valued freedom of expression, "" a Liberal Democrat Minister told The Telegraph. ""But there is genuine debate about whether girls should feel a compulsion to wear a veil when society deems children to be unable to express personal choices about other areas like buying alcohol, smoking or getting married, "" Browne said. ""That would apply to Christian minorities in the Middle East just as much as religious minorities here in Britain, "" The debate comes after Birmingham Metropolitan College changed its rules last week in an unprecedented move. It's important that the debate will held many times. We should not have prejudice about Islamic people by only the image of terrorism by IS."
NBE05347,"I read this article that I was very surprised and sympathized his opinion. I interested in His idea so, I research his opinion and idea. The emigrant policy of the Republican primary candidate Donald cards of the property tycoon is the forced repatriation. The cards which upset a republican primary election by a discrimination against illegal immigrant remark took the new material. It is one to found ""a forced repatriation corps"" which sends back an illegal immigrant staying in the United States to the own country forcibly. ""A product sends back a forced repatriation corps by a humanitarian method"". . . . . . . I talked about the cards which appeared for a news program of MSNBC this week when you must stop that millions of people wanted to come to the United States and were going to enter the country illegally. As for the cards, what kind of it; the details did not show whether was organized. For example, being the executive officer of the civilian whether you are constructed in a United States Armed Forces corps or being the vigilance committee of a volunteer patrolling in the Mexico border. The emigrant policy of cards created a pro and con so far. Newscaster of the FOX news, building O'Reilly criticize the emigrant policy of cards to build the huge wall for expenditure of Mexico in the border several months ago when not realistic. When FOX slandered oneself, the cards fought back. Two people clashed with each other again this week. I praised the policy of the Eisenhower government which the cards picked up an illegal immigrant from Mexico on the track by the televised debate of the Republican Party candidate whom FOX business network sponsored and arrested all at once. Because a way is violent, and this policy (the speech ""wet Bach"" who pointed at a Mexican emigrant did not use the cards because it was considered to be discriminatory expression now either) called ""the wet support operation"" caused the dead person, there is the viewpoint to hit human rights violations now. O'Reilly pressed you ""to have been the violent way that kicked an emigrant (as for the wet support operation) back in the own country"". John mosquito Jeb Bush of the calling at entreated cards to stop antagonizing a Hispanic qualified voter of in other Republican tickets. When ""the Hilary camp was only pleased to clap a hand as for Jeb if I made such a remark (the Democratic Party) , "" I persuaded you. Mosquito chic ""let patronize it, and leave it abroad, and everybody knows it (in illegal immigrants) when is a ridiculous argument"". I argued, it was not the argument of adult to cards."
NBE05219,"I do not agree with you. I think it is not good if there are political reasons, rejecting one part of people is the same to racial discrimination. I don't support his speech if he has some prospects or not."
NBE06806,"I think so, too. His policy has deflection too much and will win the antipathy of refugees, and I think that it bring about a new menace. So, I think that he should change it to a little milder policy."
NBE06624,"Terrorism by ISIL and immigration problems are the world must solve earliest now. Although Trump Mr. trying to exclude all the Muslims from the United States, I don't oppose the policy completely. Of course, The reason isn't Muslim is bad and it is we hardly take measures to terrorism by ISIL. They are different from the criminal group just like doing things you want to do. Their hideout exist around the world and it is also possible to hide while they aren't noticed. In addition, they are good at information warfare and part of the world of human who watched such as their videos may even become the companions of ISIL. I have felt more threat than any terrorist organization that existed until now. So I can't oppose to the radical policies of Mr. Trump. However, there is also a point which doesn't make sense. They have taken action while often shouting ""Allah Akbar"". Allah is the only God in Islam. However, we mustn't equate them with Muslims, because their behavior is far from the teachings of Islam. In Japan, the media has reported that ISIL called Islamic countries . However, it had given rise to misunderstanding that ISIL= Muslim. I think it isn't the case in the United States. Of course, I think Trump don't believe seriously prejudice that such ISIL= Muslim, but he would have raised the current policy in the near attitude at least. By saying of Mr. Trump's this statement, public opinion began to be bisected large. To be bisected means that the supporters exist. Moreover, the number was beyond my imagination. Than expected number of people was in favor of Mr. Trump. President Obama was once stopped in an attempt to give the resident rights to illegal immigrants. American measures has been changing for the immigrants."
NBE06623,"I was impressed with your opinion. Anything can not be resolved unless to try to know. Because ISIL is called Islamic countries, there are people think they are trying to eliminate the Muslims. However, it is a mistake. And it is speculation of ISIL to deepen the groove of the Muslims and the general public. The most effective measures for ISIL is to eliminate the ISIL. We have to oppose against to take action from here. To that end, at first, we must be interested in this issue."
NBE06804,"His policy was too iron-fisted, and I thought that this policy caused a misfortune for the United States. I think that he should learn that he stands in the situation of the other people and thinks about a thing."
NBE06807,"Your opinion is so great. I think so, too. I think we should the define of the all people's safety or happiness."
NBE05112,"In this article, Donald J. Trump said we should block all Muslims enter the United States. I can understand his words and thinking, but I cannot agree with him. This is because he did not think all people's safety. In other word, he worried Americans' lives. Of course, it is right for him to be concerned people in US However, today terrorism and IS are international problems. He and we, Japanese should think this problem deeply."
NBE05111,"I disagree with you. I think his speech is thoughtless. He delivered speech offensively, because of his anger toward terrorism."
NBE05641,"I agree with your opinion on point that Donald Trump's plan is not the solution for terrorism of Islamic estates. To be frank, I caught various threats of the Islamic nation as other people's affairs without a tragedy of recent Paris. May be, there were a lot of the Paris citizens who were a way of thinking like me a little ago. However, I came to think about an Islamic nation more seriously after a sudden tragedy happened in big city Paris and came to feel what's called terrorism closer. I am a sense of fear not to know what happens when and where. There will be many people who do not want to accept an immigrant to save own country like his policy in such a fear. Even if some people believing in Islam do a slaughter act and war, removing the other people of Islam who are not responsible is not good. In addition, not only it fan an extreme Islamic nation, but also will inspire people's fear even more, and it may delay a solution to the problem that the politician of a big large country of the influence suggests such a policy. If not only Donald Trump, but also many people can have courage to cut off a grudge and hatred, it may contribute to solving the problem earlier."
NBE05089,"I agree with your opinion. His offensive idea is very dangerous. His idea based on racism so. it will have bad effect for all over the world. ID15044 say ""If his plan comes true, another tragedy would happen again like it occurred in Germany during WW2"". I think so too, Mr trump's idea is very dangerous. These reasons for Americans should think again their candidate"
NBE05091,"I agree with your opinion. Mr trump's idea is not solution for terrorism. His speech is very offensive but his plans are not realistic. If his plan realize, USA will be a exclusive country. We should research him and learn a lot of things for many countrys. The knowledge will help us to think for other countrys."
NBE05088,"I agree with your opinion. I am surprised too when I watch TV news about him. Terrorism is so afraid but Mr trump's idea also afraid for me. I think that his idea will be expand and a lot of people discriminate for him. Now he discriminate muslim but he will attack other religion, races and countrys. So, his idea is very dangerous"
NBE05991,"I think that Trump should take back his words, because it may lead to misunderstanding. I think that Muslims felt themselves discriminated by Trump. However his remark doesn't mean to discriminate against Muslims. It means to prevent the terrorists from entering the US They may hide behind immigrants. IS is the most fearful group of terrorists in the world. IS is a group of red Muslims. So Trump want to ban Muslim immigration. However I think that it is the best way for solving this issue, to stop accepting all immigrants."
NBE06569,"It is great so much that a woman has named Time's Person of the year. She has the strong leadership on everything from th the problem of Syria refugees to the Greek debt crisis. Even if there is criticism for her policy, welcoming all refugees from the Middle East is humanitarian. Germany has taken the lead in accepting people fleeing from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and so on to Europe. Thought she selected the hard way, she is still sticking to her policy and rehousing to name a limit to the number of people which the country can take yin. In addition to this, she tackled the problem between Ukraine and Russia. She had stuck to efforts to keep the leaders of both countries talking to implement a peace accord. It was surprising that her speeches are usually monotonous and she often looks weird in front of the camera. Before reading this article, I thought that politicians sticking to their stance like her were very good at making a speech. Japan needs politicians who will be able to make diplomatic efforts to solve the worldwide issues."
NBE06751,"This article is with the photograph of people applauding the leadership of Merkel, but there are many opponents. However, I think that Merkel is great because there are few woman Presidents all over the world. She is like the symbol of a strong woman. It is important that not only having one's intention being strong but also hearing the other opinions of other countries and be in harmony. When will it be that the prime minister of the woman is born in Japan? It is necessary to take in some good points of German and Merkel."
NBE05619,"I think that Angela Merkel is a courageous politician. She belongs to CDU, which is a conservative party in Germany. Although her policy is almost conservative, trying to accept many refugees from Middle East is bold. It is meaningful for the conservative politicians to adopt a liberal policy. Not only the left but also moderate conservative will support her decision. However, there are a lot of problems about the Syrian refugees. Refugees can disturb the peace and deprive the German people of employment. We have to take notice of the danger of refugees. On the other hand, Donald Trump is, I think, a funny person. But he improper for the President of USA. Although his comments are influential, it is unrealistic. Therefore he is unworthy of supporting."
NBE05618,"Do you think that Shinzo Abe is a politician who will be able to make diplomatic efforts to solve the worldwide issues? I think yes. Although he is called ""extreme right-wing"", Shinzo Abe is actually a realist. For example, Statement by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, security-related bills, and the agreement between Japan and Korea on comfort women. I think these are realistic. It is meaningful for Shinzo Abe who is called ""extreme right-wing"" to adopt realistic policy. I believe that Shinzo Abe will continues to promote pacifism."
NBE06837,"When I read this article for the first time, I agreed with her plans. Of course, there are some problem and people against her like Trump. Now, we concern most is an act of terrorism. In Paris, the big terrorism was happened, we were very shocked by the news. To welcome all refugee could connect to allow for terrorists to enter the countries easily. Doing so, people in these countries will be exposed to danger. However, it is most important to think refugees' thought, I think. Most of them are victims and the number of them will be increased more and more because of a civil war and an aerial bombardment. The things that we have to do first are to think them and to help them."
NBE07048,"I want to praise Angela Merkel. Her humanitarian policy would become the support of the heart of many refugees. However, many refugees were stranded on the Austria border, which was closed, because German Prime Minister Merkel accepts refugees without any restriction and spoke out that I protect it carefully irresponsibly. The stray bullet of the warning shot of the border Police hit one of the Afghanistan refugees in a town of southeastern Bulgaria on October 15, and he died. About this problem, both the border Police and an illegal immigrant are irresponsible. The German manner beckoned many emigrants to come and caused this accident. Large-scale demonstrations are caused many times in the country, and the criticisms occur successively from the neighboring countries. Her action in itself was humanitarian, but the result that her action caused was chaotic. The Islamic nation became the topic, and the accidents happened recently in Paris and Los Angeles. The German is being exposed to terrorism threat. Originally Germany is the country with many emigrants, and Germany cannot integrate emigrants into itself as can be seen from a crime rate and a leaving school halfway rate. Because Germany cannot deal with even the emigrant of the own country, a large quantity of refugees cannot be accepted. There is not only the uneasiness of terrorism but also the financial pressure. The local government is exposed to financial burdens. The refugees who were not able to secure houses are forced to inconvenient life, and there are the refugees becoming ill, local doctor is forced to unpaid labor to save them. Germany and the German border neighborhood are in confusion in this way. Merkel gives up having idealism to solve such a problem and must grope for solutions practically. I only think that her humanitarian way of thinking is very important."
NBE06313,"It seems that Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, is humane and popular among German. She said that she accept all refugees from Syria. It is highly risky and many people were against it, so she gave up doing it. Her humanitarian stance is highly evaluated. I think representative of nation should be like her. A person who is willing to work for peace is good to make great nation. Merkel's kindness and toughness are worthy and I hope it embodied someday."
NBE06312,"I agree with your opinion. Thinking of people who are in danger of terrorism is very important thing. It is true that accepting people from Syria and other middle Eastern countries is risky thing, we should know that most of them are victims and only a few are terrorist. Saving these people is not easy thing , but understanding that kind of situation is necessary. Trying to help those people is the first step to make world peace."
NBE05830,"I agree with you. There should be more woman presidents in the world. It is the era when we talk about the need of equal between men and women. So she can be the symbol of the strong woman. Since the Germany is the country with strong power, it will change the stereotypes a lot. I also hope to see a woman president in Japan. Woman have the different way to think so there is the possibility to change the situation radically."
NBE06475,"Refugees flock on 10, 000 scales every day in Germany, and it is said that around 1, 500, 000 people seem to do refugees application in the year now. Merkel judged that Germany can accept around 50, 000-60, 000 refugees, but, actually, the number of the refugees that is different in two columns flock. Because the Syrian refugees are to be accepted as basics, all the flocking refugees camouflage refugees from Syria and Germany has great time to make the judgment that he or she is Iraq refugee or Afghan refugee or Syria refugee. And the most serious problem is to largely lack the urgently medical environment for an old man and the sick person and the arrangement of a house and the food, and the arrangement of the school for the child in a local government of the acceptance. The local government begins to scream in refugees measures. The German government is to use a great deal of expenses to cope the refugees but the expenses continue growing in the future and the Germany finance will be tight. There were many people in favor of accepting refugees at first in Germany, but now people objecting to accepting refugees begin to gradually increase because they get fed up with the too much number of the refugees. And, as a result, the approval rating of Merkel has begun to decrease while being inversely proportional with increase of the number of refugees. It may be said that this policy by Merkel ended in failure."
NBE07143,"It is wonderful decision, I think of this Prime Minister Merkel's decision. Other European countries are refusing a victim from Syria. A refugee from Syria has caused terrorism in France. Various problems may form by accepting a victim from Syria, but I think a homeless and in trouble person should be helped. Refugees from Syria don't say that everyone causes terrorism, so I think I want all refugees to be rescued."
NBE07208,"I really respect her because even if the position of president of Germany is quite dangerous, she continues to fight for everything. Germany is the most advanced countries in terms of energy technology and development. She also accepted to accommodate many refugees and even decided to give them a job. Japan should take it into consideration to pretend it."
NBE06836,"I agree with your opinion. Her action and thought are respectable, she must be a symbol of women. Now, we live in the society that man and woman are worked equal, so in the future, it will happen that the prime minister of the woman is born in Japan. She is a symbol of the woman, it is necessary to build the society that woman could live more free"
NBE06203,"I think Angela Merkel is a great politician in Germany. She made Germany stronger than before and Germany became leader of EU. Moreover, she decided to welcome many refugees from Syria. I think that she serves Germany and world. I wish there were leader such as her in Japan."
NBE05066,"I think the decision of her was not so easy, but difficult, she have decided it. This is really great thing and meaning. In 2013, Merkel won one of the most decisive victories in German history, achieving the best result for the CDU/CSU since reunification and coming within five seats of the first absolute majority in the Bundestag since 1957. She is really good politician."
NBE05065,"I agree with you. Generally speaking, many people especially in Japan, they want to belong to majority. But she is different. Her position are clearly minority, but she decided with a strong thinking and helped many refugees. As you say, I also respect her."
NBE06082,"When I read this article for the first time, I was interested in that the two has an opposing position each other has nominated first and second place by TIME person of the year. Add more information, who was chosen by readers is Bernie Sanders, making reference to immigration issues. His opinion is the profound legalization of illegal immigrants in the United States. This shows us last year's world situation. Japan is also debating between acceptance and refuse. I admire her courageous decision. That could help to make the world better. However, I think Japan have to be collected and to wait now. We should watch carefully countries allow to immigrate, including Germany."
NBE06625,"Whether it is correct Merkel is doing is I don't know. But I assess her attitude. She act with their beliefs. So she can carry out to accept all the refugees. I think she is alike the former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Now what I fear is the pace of the world doesn't match. As in the above Trump's statement, some people to oppose to her policies are in the world and his statement is also one of the opinions. Refugee problem is what the collected world must solve. The government of the world should hold more meetings that they can exchange their opinions."
NBE06271,"Frankly speaking, this news is very difficult for me to understand clearly because relations among all parties concerned is too complicated. For the time being, it is almost impossible for us to know a truth of the incident of shutting down a Russian fighter jet. Additionally, it is more important to fight against ISIS than to know a truth of the incident. So, I strongly believe that Russian and Turkey should have closer ties to fight against their common enemy, ISIS. However, according to the news, Turkey is buying millions of dollars of oil in the black market from ISIS. Considering these conditions, it seems difficult to have closer ties between two counties."
NBE05935,"It exercise economic sanctions to Turkey The exports from Russia to Turkey are cereals and gas mainly, and the limit to this part is not planned for the moment. The gas monopolistic enterprise ""gas prom"" of Russia exported gas of 27, 300 million cubic meters to Turkey last year. For an import of gas country from Russia, Turkey is a customer of the second place next to Germany. On the other hand, Turkey exported food of 1 billion dollars (approximately 120 billion yen) to Russia in first nine months of 2015. The main item is a tomato and citrus fruits, and these occupy half or more of the import. The Mayor of Kuno Berri center thinks that Russia may not limit the import of vegetables before a holiday of the New Year. On the other hand, it is said that I seem to tighten hygiene management. A main import item from other Turkey includes cloth and textiles. Most of retailers of Russian clothing and the footwear place an order in a factory of Turkey. Cloth imported according to the data of Russian Federation Office for National Statistics for first nine months of 2015 from Turkey to Russia and the textiles 514 million dollars (approximately 61, 680 million yen), the footwear 48 million dollars (approximately 5, 760 million yen). When sanctions are exercised in this field, the Turkish article for sale may flow into Russia via Belarus"
NBE06839,"When I read this article for the first time, it is difficult for me to understand clearly because there are many factor in the Middle East, this problem is not a easy problem. However, I think that the action, Turkish government will pass new legislation to ban Kurdish activity and weaken the HDP and other opposition parties, will not get better, because this action will not connect democratization. One-party dictatorship will be spread weakening the HDP, and the opinion of the people will be ignored. In these difficult affairs, it is important for the country to listen to the voice of the people. Also, the relation between Turkey and Russia will be needed to improve. The incident that the soldier, who protects the country, was killed must not be happened, but in these affairs, the conflict like this can be increased. These countries' purpose is same, to solve the problem about ISIS, therefore I wish these countries would cooperate well."
NBE07144,"This news is very difficult for me. When I read this article for the first time, I couldn't understand. First there is a Turkish folk problem. Only 1 race lived in Japan, so I couldn't understand a folk problem so much. There is a problem of ISIS with the 2nd. ISIS came to do terrorism at Europe as well as the Middle East. I fear ISIS. I'm hoping the moment is also early and for this world to become peaceful."
NBE06808,"Russia and Turkey developed the war of ten several times for many centuries. However, I continued the friendly relationship that was not seen so far for these past 20 years. Even if the shooting down of the Russian military plane with the Turkish military plane of 24th does not lead to the military collision of the two countries, what two countries relations are cooling rapidly is apparent to anyone. They fanned the nationalist-like mood of the nation for many years to get support of the general public in autocratic leaders with the President of Putin Russia, the Erdogan President of Turkey. Both of them shelved the difference in the foreign policy until now and were bent to plan two countries affiliated expansion. Although they are opposed by Syria, Cyprus, a problem of Ukraine, the trade relations of the two countries present an active state. But, by military plane shooting down in Russia, the separation of politics and the economy became impossible. They let feelings get excited with the two countries, and Russia moves in retaliation early. Manager dormitory tray Nin of the Carnegie international peace foundation Moscow center explains, ""the relations that Russia and Turkey got after Cold War end will be cut off for the duration, and the two countries relations came back to hostility, doubt, the relations of the competition""; ""relations between the top are what was spoiled, and it is a relation of ""sultan"" and ""czar"" that is extremely important. Erdogan, both of them of Putin have already spoken each other, They are not with expectation of a partner. In addition, a factor to deepen this crack does not have it, or the difference in thought about the situation of Syria and ISIL is regarded as uneasiness, too. I knew such a Russia and the historic opposition of Turkey by having learned world history, but was surprised that such an opposition lasted to the present. In addition, it might be hard to understand the problem that such a religion affected too much from the country such as religion-coloured thin Japan, but it was the problem that was important for the person concerned and thought that it was what it was hard to solve."
NBE05934,"I exercise economic sanctions to Turkey The exports from Russia to Turkey are cereals and gas mainly, and the limit to this part is not planned for the moment. The gas monopolistic enterprise ""gas prom"" of Russia exported gas of 27, 300 million cubic meters to Turkey last year.

When sanctions are exercised in this field, the Turkish article for sale may flow into Russia via Belarus"
NBE06083,"After I read this article, I thought two things about it. First, I think Turk should be more collaborative with Kurds. Kurds are desiring to have their own country for many years. The fault information by AKP made their dream become not true. So it is a must that HDP should win next time. In order to do that, HDP and other opposition parties should get together and defeat AKP to stop the new registration. Second, most of the problem in the Middle East is involved in Islamic state. So I think it is best to form an alliance with countries in the Middle East. If the existence of Islamic state disappeared, most of the problem would be solved."
NBE06658,Conflicts between Turkey and Russia made me surprise. Turkey and Russia battled many times in the past days. I thought it may be the return of the Crimean War. I would like to keep a close watch on this news.
NBE06838,"I agree with your opinion. When I read this article for the first time, it is difficult for me to understand clearly because there are many factor in the Middle East, this problem is not a easy problem. Also, I think that Russian and Turkey should have closer ties to fight against their common enemy, ISIS. However, at the same time, we should think people in ISIS, I think. Why they keep to do terrorism? Why the terrorism has been happened? Standing the side of each other, this problem of terrorism will be close to solved."
NBE06866,"It is very difficult problem for me. Turkey and Russia are insisting each different insistence. The other tell a lie but we can't tell the different. Now, International society have to make corporation to attack ISIS so I want to talk frank between two countries. I want to make peacemaking two countries."
NBE06204,"I disagree with you. In ancient, Turkey and Russia didn't get on well with each other. There are a lot of conflicts between them. This incident is one of conflicts. So, I am not worried about the incident. However, my interesting only point is that US helps or doesn't help Turkey."
NBE06270,"I was very shocked to know that there had been a corruption in FIFA for a long time. Additionally, I was very surprised to hear that Russian President Vladimir Putin said ""Blatter has done a great deal to develop football and cooperation between peoples and nations and, therefore, deserves a Nobel Peace Prize"". I suspect that the FIFA's decision on holding the world cup in 2018 in Russia was done by corruption between Russia and FIFA. If it is true, this decision should not be allowed and should be overturned. Recently, there was injustice such as emblem relating to Tokyo Olympic in 2020. I feel that there are so many injustice relating to sports. I strongly believe that people who are engaged in all kinds of sports activity should not work in a corrupt way."
NBE06951,"Corruption of the soccer world is not to have begun in now. A bribe and the purchase of Juventus, put-up games are taking place many times. Because a demon of the soccer world appeared on the face in this way, you should stare at the soccer world taking advantage of this again."
NBE05728,"I had shocked when I heard this news. I think the sport, from the soccer down, should not be used a dirty money. This is occasion of declining content. Soccer and baseballs bribe news reached our ears. Of course these sports are popularity so, reached our ears. But still this is not good situation."
NBE06892,"When I read this news, I couldn't contain my anger. People who hold responsible posts should act rationally. If they receive a bribe, they lose their trust from people. I expect their future activities that get them regaining their trust."
NBE06835,"When I heard this news for the first time, I was very shocked. Football is one of the popular sports, of course I like it. Hearing such the news, we can't enjoy the sport naturally, and soccer effects the global affairs by now. This news is a good example, Due to some people's action, many problem is appeared. Actually, when I heard that the host country of 2022 World Cup was decided Qatar, I think that why Qatar were decided. However, being these problems, we have no choice but to doubt Platini and Blatter. Also, watching Putin's action, it is clear that the presence of the intrigues is started. Nowadays, there are many news of gambling. This move can connect decreasing the popularity of the sport, so I wish these actions would disappear."
NBE07142,"I was quite shocked about a corruption problem of FIFA. Because FIFA is the organization of the very big soccer, and the soccer World Cup FIFA sponsors is a very popular meet as well as Olympics. Wonderful protuberance is also shown by World Cup in Japan. Such, I can't hide surprise from being corruption by the authoritative organization internationally. I'll reform the organization and want you to be the sound organization immediately."
NBE06474,"I like soccer very much. I have practiced soccer for 12 years. So I'm sorry to hear the news like this. But soccer regularly captures headlines around the globe for its nail-biting action. But on Wednesday, May 27, the sport captured people's attention for a different reason. More than a dozen FIFA officials were arrested on corruption charges in Zurich, Switzerland after a four-year investigation by the US government. To begin with FIFA is the French acronym for the Federation Internationale de Football Association. In the U.S. , football is known as soccer. The organization, headquartered in Zurich, oversees 209 national soccer associations and puts together tournaments, including the World Cup. FIFA makes billions from this international tournament held every four years. Much of this money comes from TV broadcast rights and marketing deals. US officials charged 14 people with 47 criminal charges related to bribery. A dozen different schemes were included in the formal charges. Prosecutors said that hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal payments were made to unfairly influence media rights deals and the outcome of FIFA elections. ""We welcome the actions and the investigations by the U. S. and Swiss authorities, "" said FIFA president Sepp Blatter. ""[We] believe it will help to reinforce measures that FIFA has already taken to root out any wrongdoing in football. "" Blatter was reelected to a fifth term on May 29, despite calls to postpone the election amid the investigationss. I was surprised that though there was such a case, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Blatter has done a great deal to develop football and cooperation between peoples and nations and, therefore, deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. I think this is ridiculous. So that soccer continues being loved by many people, I pray for FIFA becoming the group deserving Nobel Peace prize truly without causing a corruption case in the future."
NBE07239,"When I heard this news, I had a feeling like that ""I'm hearing such news relates corruption almost every day. "". I think the only solution to this kind of problem is to arrest such people every time they commit a crime."
NBE06311,"It is a pity that Sepp Blatter and MIchel Platini, who are the most influential persons of football society, acted bribery. FIFA is one of the biggest sports institutions of the world , and football is one of the most popular sports, so I want it act properly and improve environment of football. As it is professional, it is natural that it expects economic effect, but we mustn't forget that the role of FIFA is not only developing football but also becoming an element of cooperation between countries and nations. I like football very much and have played it for more than ten years , so I hope football society advancing more and more. This kind of matter can prevent football from advancing well, so I can't forgive any bribery."
NBE07207,"Bribery and corruption are unavoidable throughout the world. Even in Japan, it is not only foreign affair but that exists in this country. However, FIFA is international association so that they should act quite fairly. As United Nation isn't working well, we have to organize many things in order and must clarify many evils. Football is popular sports all over the world, which means that there are many fans especially children in poor countries. Football is regarded as simple sport that anyone can play and require only a ball. It gives hopes and fineness to everybody, so there shouldn't be any corruption in that world."
NBE05829,"I like football so I've heard the rumor of corruption before. But this was the first time to read on newspaper. I know Blatter has done so many great things by using football as a tool make two countries cooperate and so on. And he might have deserved to get Nobel peace Prize, if he had not done the bribery. There should not be money involved in any sports because it would make them so boring. I remember when Korea cheated in FIFA World Cup in 2002. Basically they gave money to the referee and that ruined the whole match in that World Cup. We should keep it clean by any means."
NBE07176,"I am not the first time that I hear the news of this type of story. It makes us distrust about sports. Watching sports becomes lively simply because it is a fair fight, and the fighting person performs it seriously. These are basics of sports and are what you must certainly follow. So I think that corruption is often bad news when I heard this word. But, by this article Russian President Vladimir Putin said ""Blatter has done a great deal to develop football and cooperation between peoples and nations and, therefore, deserves a Nobel Peace Prize"". This remark is a remark to deserve praise for the corruption. I can not understand exactly if his contribution into the world's humanitarian sphere is huge as he was always trying to use football not only as sports but also as an element of cooperation between countries and nations. From this article we should learn a way of the right corruption."
NBE07175,"I agree with your opinion. This kind of news often reached our ears. Sports such as soccer, baseball should be fair. There may be some people who lost the trust about sports. So, we should be careful not to get up by such a case."
NBE06310,"I somewhat disagree with your opinion. Of course bribery is bad thing and never be allowed, but in many sports broadcasting in TV, money-making is one of the most important thing. The move of connecting sports and business is now prosperous. For example, there is an institution that forecast victory or defeat of football games, that is called TOTO. TOTO is popular gambling of sports. Sports and money can't completely cut off."
NBE05967,I got shocked read this article. But many soccer funs have been noticed that FIFA is corrupted and receive a bribe. So I was shocked but was no surprised. In the wake of this I hope that FIFA will be reborn and be a clean organization. By the way Not only in soccer but also many sports such as in baseball we often hear about the bribe. They people who are involved are rich enough. Why do they offer such dirty money? I cannot understand that.
NBE05727,I agree with your opinion. Like this gambling news in sport respect may be some people who lost the trust about sports. I suspect that the FIFA's decision on holding the world cup in 2018 in Russia was done by corruption between Russia and FIFA. Gambling and bribe is occasion of declining content. I wish these actions would disappear too.
NBE06834,"I agree with your opinion. I was also very shocked to know that there had been a corruption in FIFA for a long time, hearing such a news, we can't enjoy the sport naturally, and soccer effects the global affairs by now. Also, watching Putin's action, it is clear that the presence of the intrigues is started. Like you, I also suspect that the FIFA's decision on holding the world cup in 2018 in Russia was done by corruption between Russia and FIFA, we have no choice but to doubt Platini and Blatter. I wish that people who are engaged in all kinds of sports activity should not work in a corrupt way."
NBE06202,"I agree with you. Certainly, FIFA was corrupted and reserved many bribes. I have heard the rumors that other sport organizations is corrupted several times. I can't understand doing such a things, too. However, FIFA will try to become clear organization. About dirty of other sport organization, many people will know it in near future."
NBE06657,"When I read this article, I couldn't hide my surprise. I like soccer very much, so I knew all the name which mentioned in this article. They were all fantastic football player in the pasty days. However, they breeded graft and corruption. Did they lose their sportsmanship? I think they should be strongly blamed for this corruption."
NBE07109,"I felt the same as you. I was completely stunned by the news of FIFA corruptions. I have being a lover of football for a long time and always watch the game during the weekend. Therefore, I am very disappointed by this terrible news. I hope things will get better in the future."
NBE07238,It seems that I hear such news relates corruption almost every day. I think the only solution to this kind of problem is to arrest such people every time they commit a clime.
NBE05063,"I haven't known that. For me, your opinion is so interesting. When I heard this news first, I felt that it is very rare case of Corruption of the soccer world. Because I have not heard yet in my life. In the baseball world or Sumo world, the corruptions happened often, however, in the soccer world that exist. The fact is so disappointed but I am glad to know the real knowledge about the soccer world."
NBE05064,"I researched about this news because I was interested in. The result of research, according to the first page of this sight, ""Near the end of May 2015, fourteen people were indicted in connection with an investigation by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division (IRS-CI) into wire fraud, racketeering, and money laundering. "" Soccer is one of the popular sport so I want them to take back the position and the honor."
NBE05349,"I read this news and I shocked that knew the fact. Therefore I want more information so I research the FIFA, football's world governing body, has been engulfed by claims of widespread corruption since summer 2015, when the US Department of Justice indicted several top executives. It has now claimed the careers of two of the most powerful men in football, FIFA President Sepp Blatter and Uefa President Michel Platini, after they were banned for eight years from all football-related activities by FIFA's ethics committee. A Swiss criminal investigation into the pair is also continuing. FIFA's president Sepp Blatter has always denied any wrongdoing - but in September, he too was made the subject of a Swiss criminal investigation, launched alongside the US inquiry. The scandal erupted in May, with a raid on a luxury hotel in Zurich and the arrest of seven FIFA executives - conducted at the behest of the US authorities. In May the US indicted 14 current and former FIFA officials and associates on charges of ""rampant, systemic, and deep-rooted"" corruption following a major inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation . And in December, 16 more officials were charged following the arrest of two FIFA vice-presidents in at the same hotel in Zurich. Former Brazil football federation chief Ricardo Teixeira was among those accused of being ""involved in criminal schemes involving well over $200m in bribes and kickbacks""."
NBE05221,I think so too. I think sport is the thing which gives people dream and the courage to live. I don't want to see this kind of article. It was so shocking.
NBE06382,"I think so that the corruption like this leads to unsporting behavior. In this case, there is a strong possibility that the host country of the World Cup is decided by dishonest means. The host country has a very important role, and people in the host country might be going to go wild more than anyone in the other countries. Therefore, there is no doubt that the host country and FIFA cease to be trusted by this corruption. They make a mess of the worldwide event."
NBE07397,"I think this fraud of FIFA should be poised strictly, because top, famous groups' mistakes can cause great influence even if it is very small."
NBE07489,"I was surprised at seeing the pictures of thousands of shoes to represent their opposition to fossil fuels in other article for the first time. And after reading this article, I have two ideas. First, I agree that Paris police regulated protest demonstration. It is sure that freedom of expression is really important, but it is more important for the citizens in Paris that Paris government prevent recurrence of the terrorism, I think. Secondly, I think it was great that each country, including the G77 group of developing countries such as China and India, came to an agreement with attempt to limit the rise in global temperatures to less than 2C. We have been forced to make difficult decision about global warming in recent years. And we have to apply the brakes to a rise in temperature. For that reason, we need the agreement of developing countries. Therefore, this agreement might change our future world, I think."
NBE05673,"I have already known this news. The global environment is the worst now. The main cause is a carbon dioxide emission. COP21's main debate is that it does not emit carbon dioxide which contributes to global warming. The country exhausting carbon dioxide most is China. But, it is difficult for China to reduce a carbon footprint for the middle of the economic growth. However, it was decided that I reduced China. Large reduction of carbon dioxide is demanded from Japan with it. We should reduce carbon dioxide at the whole world in cooperation with the country, too."
NBE07325,"I had thought that it would be difficult to reach an agreement about attempt to put a limit on rising global temperatures at the climate change summit in Paris. Because developed countries and developing countries have diametrically opposite opinions about carbon dioxide emissions reduction. It is about difference of the weight of responsibility. So, I was surprised to hear the news. It is a splendid achievement that all 196 countries and regions agreed with the proposal to cut carbon emissions. I think the adoption of the decision entitled Paris Agreement means exactly a historical moment. Both right for a country to develop and necessity to protect our planet are balanced in the pact. It is promising enough and I believe we seized a chance to change the world. I was relieved to hear the deal didn't fail overcoming a problem due to a mistranslation. Only a word makes a great difference. How difficult and important translations are!I hope the aim promised in the document is achieved thanks to each country's effort like Sweden."
NBE05794,"I felt very good thing for the time being that all countries including developed and developing have a consent about a settlement plan for global warming. However, it is the fact that there are the various compromise due to take in the islands nations which offended this agreement. As a result, this agreement have no legal punishment like Kyoto protocol, a half of punishment were leaving to each countries. I think they shouldn't compromise this point, the punishment is only is cold eye by another countries. Also, according to this article, the argument was about to failure owing to interpret mistake when they argued. This accident is nice to use ""It's a great pity"". Global warming is composed as soon as possible. This is a problem we must think. However, fewer people made a concrete plan to compose and act. So, this congress was necessary to keep pace with posture of each countries, but it's outrageous to make a mistake. Of course, we should think to compose the global warming, and also we should think more to make an effort not to make a mistakes."
NBE06272,"I would like to welcome that all countries agreed to cut carbon emissions for the first time. I hope that this pact will become a start to solve the climate change. However, it seems difficult to adopt the decision entitled Paris Agreement in countries which agreed with it by mistranslation in the draft text from a ""should"" to a shall"". I hope that all counties which agreed with it should adopt this decision in order to solve climate change."
NBE06570,"I knew that he latest UN conference on climate change held in Paris, where terrible terrorism just had occurred. But I did not know that people donated thousands of shoes to represent their opposition to fossil fuels. I was supposed to see the pictures in which a large number of shoes are put on the street in other articles. I think it is right that police banned the large demonstration. The problem of CO2 emissions are different to solve. However each country must make an effort in order to reduce CO2, they also must consider their economic development. Each country is caught in a dilemma, choosing between economic growth and environmental protection. Especially, developing countries insist that developed countries should take the lead in reducing carbon emissions. I hope that Swedish example will prosper, but it will probably take quite some time for this plan to reach fruition. What is important to reduce carbon emissions is each of us think about environment and make an effort to protect the environment."
NBE06571,I sympathize your opinion. Countries are not a monolith on this issue. There is disarray among countries over the amount of emissions of carbon dioxide. We have to take action before it is too late.
NBE06841,"I think that if contents of Paris Agreement were realized, the environment would be changed, the agreement is the first step to solve the environmental problem. It is important that all country agree with the agreement. Before this conference, there are some collisions. In 1997, the US did not take part in the conference and in 2009, some countries did not do too. Because to take part in this conference means to disturb the development of economy, so in this conference, all countries agreed with the agreement will be connected to solve the environmental problem. But, there are some problems too. The mistranslation, from a ""should"" to a ""shall"", may connect to fail this agreement. If not should but shall, there are no forces, many developed and developing countries might break the agreement. Therefore, it is needed to have the power of law with the agreement, I think."
NBE06867,"I think it is very historical agreement about COP21 held in Paris. The advanced country and developing country could make same target and imposed duty both side. I think that made agreement to impose make good influence to stop global warming. Until now, developing country said responsible of global warming and if stopping global warming, only advanced country should impose duty and they don't have to do so. However, recently global warming, especially CO2 emission is very serious. We have to make action immediately with effective way and make cooperation all over the wold is important because today, it is impossible to stop global warming only few countries. Made specific target was also good. Aiming control increase temperature less than 2 centigrade from the age of industrial revolution is suitable target I think because it is difficult, but not impossible to carry out. We have to make effort to stop global warming."
NBE05729,"I read the article, I surprised because it would be difficult to reach an agreement about attempt to put a limit on rising global temperatures at the climate change summit in Paris. I thought developing countries and developed country have diametrically contrary opinions about carbon dioxide emissions reduction. I hope that this pact will be a start to solve the climate change. The problem of CO2 emissions are difficult to solve. However each country must make an effort in order to reduce CO2, they also must consider their economic development. I hope all countries agreed with the agreement will be connected to solve the environmental problem. Of course Japan should decrease CO2. So we should cooperate decreasing CO2. We should reduce carbon dioxide at the whole world in cooperation with the country. We have to make effort to decrease CO2. I think our effort can stop change climate."
NBE06893,"This topic is very interesting because when I was a high school student, I studied it deeply. Global warming is big problem in today's society. In Japan, people didn't care about environment seriously in the past. They put special emphasis on development. However, this thought caused pollution. Some people were taken illness. This experience make the Japanese government pursue the policy about environment. Maybe almost developed countries experienced these happenings like Japan, so they understand the importance of policy against global warming. However, developing countries have different view of points. In developing countries, the most important thing is development. There are a lot of things that they should do in order to become affluent, for example, making education substantial, constructing factories and making the market active. Therefore, developing countries don't put special emphasis on environment. Developed countries and developing countries have different idea each other, so it isn't easy to corporate in order to confront global warming. People in developing countries may think global warming is caused by developed countries, so they don't feel the need of their cutting greenhouse gasses. However, developed countries think that it is very necessary to gain developing countries' understanding. In my opinion, global warming is the chance for people in the whole world to become united. It is true that they have many different point, but unless they overcome differences by understanding and accepting each other, maybe they can't stop global warming. They should deepen their understanding of foreign countries at first. Of course, chemical studies is also important to solve global warming. Deepening their understanding and making progress with chemical studies is key to standing up to global warming and coming peace in the whole world."
NBE07145,"I think a developing nation as well as an advanced should also do an effort of reduction in greenhouse gas. Because the amount of the greenhouse gas which occurs in case of financial development is a huge one. When establishing a reduction target, a developing nation would consider a supply source of the new energy for growth. I think it can develop into the environment financially well when doing that. I think it's strange to reduce only at an advanced again. It's because a developing nation is also discharging a lot of greenhouse gasses. I think it's important to cooperate by all countries and be reducing a greenhouse gas."
NBE06314,"CO2 emission is one of the most serious environmental problems. Reducing it is necessary to stop climate change, but now the treaties like COP and Kyoto Protocol don't work well. To achieve green environment, we must make absolute treaty and observe it. Economic powers like China and The. U. S. are the keys to improve environment. , yet these countries won't keep treaty. Continuing persuasion is important to reduce CO2."
NBE07209,"Environmental protection particularly global warming should be seriously considered by every person and country. China and The United States are the countries that emit co2 the most, but they don't really cope with it. Since industrial revolution in 19th century, co2 emissions and global warming is progressing little and little. There is a theory that global warming is a lie of someone and gracious epoch is coming right now. We are not experts so that we can't distinguish what is the true story. Anyway, there are many abnormal phenomenon recently. Warm winter causes lack of snow at the ski resort. hurricanes become bigger and harm much more areas and people. If it continues in the future, we will face shortage of aliment. Space exploration has been advancing and some people think about migrate to the Mars. But we should firstly think about saving our mother planet. On this point, it is remarkable that almost all nations have participated into COP21 last month. Having the same goal and clarify it is very significant."
NBE06809,"The contents of the agreed Paris agreement were in the latter half, and they proposed the direction that zeroed the greenhouse gas discharge by human activities substantially at the whole world for ""(it mentions that they greatly contribute to risk reduction to hold down to 1.5 degrees) which within it, controlled a rise in world average temperature 2 degrees"" advocated as whole target for this century. Therefore all countries made a discharge reduction target and were required to submit it and it imposed duty that the country for the achievement took measures and was done. It is proposed that all countries gradually shift to an aim for the whole country while considering the conditions of a country of each country about the form of the aim in that. And It included the structure which improved an insufficient action by ""the aim review every five years"" under the present conditions. In addition, It was affected, and it was included in the country which needed support by a thing and a climate change (warming) that contributed a fund to the developing country voluntarily (to other developing countries) was new, setting it up to a loss and the countries which suffered damage to support it while a developed country led it. For substantial discharge zero, the direction that continues strengthening climate change (warming) measures of the whole world continuously in future would be shown definitely if I see it generally, and it may be said that it is epoch-making international agreement. I think there is big significance in having shown the posture that 196 countries which gathered for this meeting above all unite and work on. The damage by the climate change spreads all over the world steadily. Furthermore A drought, abnormal weather, a rise in sea surface water level, the expansion of the infectious disease, irreparable damage including the extinction of the straight seed are felt uneasy about. It is an island country and countries to hold a lot of poors called the late departure developing country that receive the damage at the very beginning, but Japan is no exception at all, too. As for this agreement, it will be people and a creature suffering from the damage of such a climate change in the first valuable step to protect nature. However, it is far so that it is said that 26% reduction targets which Japan advocates are enough now in that. At first it proposes a cooperating posture, and, by Shima, Ise Summit of May, 2016, it is important to the measures that arrange domestic measures steadily, and are international to raise an aim in an opportunity of the aim presentation that there is once again in 2020."
NBE05936,"The Paris agreement adopted under the command of Fabius is unique in the meaning called the environmental protection in the meaning called climate change measures. I state the upper limit of the rise in temperature of this planet clearly for a long term and exhibit the realization method. The fund enabling the correspondence of the developing country is contributed, and there is contriving it of promote a more eager action, is strong, reviewing it. This becomes the key to achieve a purpose to hold a temperature rise in check considerably than twice low. This agreement shows a new method whether the world develops into above all without putting a burden on the earth to a cuttlefish. A viewpoint how realizes a sustainability in the long term is the core of this agreement. If it can be realized, it becomes the decision to change the world to."
NBE05795,"I think so. There are some compromise such as regarding China though this agreement is chosen by all countries. It is the fact that China is great exhausting country. As a result, this agreement will be nothing but ostensible. At first, we should think to reduce carbon dioxide by ourselves."
NBE06840,"I don't agree with your opinion that a developing nation as well as an advanced should also do an effort of reduction in greenhouse gas, because it is not equal that only developed countries grow economic. I think that most of CO2 was came into existence by developed countries like the US, Japan and China. So, these countries have responsibility that they should solve the environmental problem. Also, I think that a gap between developed countries and developing countries is spread more and more. Therefore, an advanced should do an effort of reduction in greenhouse gas."
NBE07210,No country wants to take responsibility. that's clear and I agree with you.
NBE06205,I think that it is very dangerous to hold COP21 in Paris. They should stop hold COP21 in Paris.
NBE06131,"Recently, it is a major problem years global warming. All countries should take steps measures for stopping global warming. Both developed countries and developing countries are think about solution of global. I think a good solution to decide a number of specific carbon dioxide reduction."
NBE07177,"I was interested to COP21 from the front where this article is read and was checking it beforehand. Therefore the time when this article was read, very, interest, it was attracted. COP21 adopted an international structure of a global warming measure after 2020 ""Paris agreement"" formally. The contents of the Paris agreement on which you agreed are put up as the whole target, ""An average temperature rise of the world is suppressed at less than twice. "", it was pointed, and the direction where the greenhouse effect gas amount of emission by human activity is being made a zero substantially was proposed in the second half in this century in the whole world. The Kyoto Protocol has decided a greenhouse effect gas reduction target of an advanced country by negotiations. But, the amount of emission in a certain developing country started to occupy that majority of the world, and dissociation with the original purpose of a treaty stood out in relief. This meeting was held to settle such problem. This is the destination where a meeting was held roughly. For the respective countries to decide a target at this meeting, Japan, like, a target was put up. I think Japanese technology is indispensable to achieve the goal decided at this meeting. To need high technology and have such technology because to achieve a goal, Japan is because it's possible. Therefore I should think should many Japanese should go to have an interest to this meeting and achieve a goal."
NBE07324,"I agree with you. As for environmental problems, I think that the most important and indispensable thing is international cooperation."
NBE05222,I agree with you. We have to make effort to reduce carbon dioxide to save our living places.
NBE06626,"Demonstration is one way to move the decision of the government. But protesters should not be mob. France is a country adopting democracy. But range allowed to do is determined. I want a part of the people to observe the moderation. It is that very good the Paris agreement has been adopted. This will change measures to environmental issues. However, I think they must provide legally binding firmly because of such agreements. This agreement may make some countries exploit and make the escape route if there is a halfway definition. All countries must check other countries carefully."
NBE06910,I feel there have ever been few opportunities to speak with my friends in English because I still cannot speak clearly and smoothly and it spend much time on changing what I want to become to tell my listener into English. But I want to tell you my feeling or opinion in English. So I will practice speaking English frequently.
NBE05636,I regret that there were a lot of points which pronunciation was awkward and that I couldn't respond appropriate comments to partners and return good words. Good points were that I could answer smoothly to the questions about the news thanks to reading the contents of the news carefully in advance.
NBE05815,"I listened to every records I made in this semester. I think some of them are bad, but some of them have improved since the last semester. It is so hard to express what you really think in English and I know I have to practice a lot more. It will be necessary to be able to speak English when you are in the multinational firm. I think I need to study more and more to become what I want to be."
NBE07064,"When I listen my recording, I felt that I am not good at English. It is difficult for me to express my feeling immediately. I tend to make proper English sentence."

NBE05519,"Opportunity hearing speaking of own English is rarely. After I tried actually listening, I thought my pronunciation and intonation were not very well. My speaking of English was like Japanese. I thought that it is not understood absolutely when I speak a native speaker of English. In addition, in spite of being some that I want to say, I did not come up with the word many times. So, conversation was not very well. I thought that it was important to replace my opinion with easy words."
NBE05659,"I think that this listening system is very good system, because, I can become speaking english and hearing english. And, I can communicate other people, so we could make many friends. Sometimes, I feel heavy, but this lesson is important for me. I did not like English, but now I like English. Next year, I hope class like this class."
NBE06979,"I think my speaking has improved since last semester. In this semester, I had more chance to express my opinions in English because I wanted to improve my pronunciation. As a result, I came to have confidence when I spoke English. What was more, it was very interesting to exchange the article which students choose each other. I am happy to have many opportunities to discuss with my friends."
NBE06732,I think my speaking wasn't smooth. I don't have the ability to speak with many words. I should memorize English words. I want to speak about my opinion smoothly.
NBE05748,"I think, I could not speak in English well. However, what I can get the opportunity to talk with my friend in English is so useful to me. So, I'd like to improve my speaking skill more. In addition, I should have more information about the news in the world."
NBE07446,"I thought that my pronunciation is hard to listening, and I should speak a little more slowly."
NBE06587,"When I listened my recordings, I found that my English did not improve. I thought that I was poor at communicating with my partner. It was difficult for me to tell my opinion."
NBE07125,I think it's very fine for me about this recording system. Because it will be very good review to hear my recording. My English was not smooth at all.
NBE06117,"This recording system is very good. There are two good points. First of all, this system can communicate my class mate. This system is very interesting because I don't know that who speak with me. However the conversation is very fun. I think that I was able to make friends. Next good point is that I can listen to my English. I can found improvement points. My English is difficult to hear. I should speak more slowly. This is my first time to listen to my English. I want to talk more slowly from now on because partner easy to listen to my English."

NBE06398,I think that my a pronunciation is bad. My partner speaks English clearly. But I feel I can speak English more smoothly than at first. I try to do my best to improve my pronunciation continually!
NBE07345,It was difficult for me to have a natural conversation with my friends in English. I learned that the natural conversation is not only repeating the questions and answers that are decided or reading the things we have written on our papers. I hope I will be able to speak more naturally. I also think it is necessary to ask when I do not understand.
NBE06886,"I think recording system is very beneficial to improve my English. I can replay and confirm my speaking, so I can check the point that I should better."
NBE05781,"When I listen my recordings, I think I must improve English skill more. This is not only speaking but writing and reading because one of reason is my speaking stopped on the way. I reconsidered learn it once again at first."
NBE07311,"I never used Japanese words in all conversations. However I found that I'm not good at translating my opinion from Japanese to English quickly. It may be very difficult for everyone, but I want to speak more smoothly. I need more practice and want to expand my vocabulary."
NBE07475,"Thank you for this record, I can listen to conversation and pronunciation objectivity. I tried to have a natural conversation, but I could not do it better than I thought. I feel that I have to improve English skills and I should always think about why I have the opinions."
